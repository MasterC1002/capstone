(Slight rant)	Sepoohroth	373	83	55	"I am a huge fan of the Sourcefed crew, as I'm sure most of you are as well, but the majority of the top posts are about Meg or Trish's boobs. The ladies of Sourcefed are attractive, don't get me wrong, but I'm starting to get a creeper vibe from the way some people comment about them.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's fine to consider the ladies hot and even post up some of the photoshoot type pictures (like Meg's poster) but the pausing of videos on boob shots and stuff can be a little much.

I probably sound like an uptight douche and I really hope I don't. I just browse this subreddit for a lot more than random dudes drooling over the girls. There's a lot more going on in Sourcefed than that, so let's enjoy it.

**tl;dr:** We all know the Sourcefed ladies are sexy, let's not be creepers."	t5_2tiwp	True

P.S. I made this in like 5 minutes, so if there's something you want to add, or if you want to make your own list, feel free to leave it in a comment :D

Take a drink when:

* Anyone wags their finger (or says ""no, no"") (2 for Trisha)

* An embarrassing photo is put on screen

* Whenever anyone references something Steve is afraid of

* Whenever the camera zooms in

* When anyone has a ""reaction face"" (2 for Phil)

* Whenever anyone convinces someone to switch their opinion

* Whenever anyone references the table or the bowl

* Whenever Meg or Trisha get sassy

So like I said, if you want to change anything up, feel free to leave a comment. It also may or may not be a good idea to watch more than one episode at a time while playing this (depends how drunk you want to get :P)

I was ecstatic to hear that you were coming to my hometown of Phoenix for your show. I live in a suburb outside of the city and about 20 minutes from where you're going to be August 16. However, I am leaving to go back to school on the east coast that morning so I won't be able to make the show, which was a let down. [This GIF summarizes how I felt](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/50192cf1eab8eab15200002e/michael-phelps-mom-cheers-200-meter-butterfly-silver-medal.gif). 


I've gone through high school and some college watching the PhilipDefranco show, and I can honestly say it has impacted me more than any class I've taken. A few of my ""stupid-teen-life-revelations"" have been thinking about some things that you say in your show. I watch every episode, and I can honestly say I have the deepest respect for you. My current girlfriend and I bonded over SourceFed when we both found out we watch it, and it became a daily habit to sit down and watch the episodes together. It suffices to say that I love the work you guys all do. Also, thanks for the common sense, the world needs it.


So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I would love to find a way to even just shake your hand and take a picture with you before I leave, so if that would be possible that morning or any day before the 16th, it would be great. Or play a round of Cards Against Humanity with you guys, it would make my year. Please let me know, I'm willing to really do whatever in order to see you before I leave. Also it would give me some bragging rights among my friends and possibly a reason to update my Google+ status. You guys and I both know it takes something big for someone to do that that isn't famous or marketing. 


Thanks,
greatestscott88


TL;DR: Asking to meet you guys sometime before the 16th because I can't make the show. 


Edit: I'm not exactly sure who is going from the crew, or if it's just Phil, or whoever, but nonetheless I'd love to meetup!

Edit 2: I'm not trying to be selfish or anything, I was just hoping that there was a way I could meet you guys. I know it's a slim chance, and I know it most likely won't happen. I'm only one person and not that important compared to how busy you guys are. I understand that. I just needed to try. I apologize if I upset anyone."	t5_2tiwp	True

- Chinese bird flu outbreak.

1369406609.0	1ez0ym	Dear Hosts, board games on SourceFedNERD!	Hman27	130	17	37	"Day one SourceFed subscriber, day one SourceFedNERD! subscriber. I'm not sure how active the hosts and powers that be at SourceFed are on this subreddit, but I have some suggestions for SourceFedNERD!

I am a board game hobbyist, aficionado, and self-proclaimed ambassador. I was super pumped when you guys played Cards Against Humanity, and it made me realize how great it would be to see the SourceFed crew playing some of my favorite, lesser-known games. I typically play 2+ hour strategy games, but there are some fantastic party games that aren't readily found in big box stores and are barely known to most of the masses. The hobby board games market is going through a sort of a renaissance right now. Sales are booming, the internet is a-buzz, and board game Kickstarters are raising millions of dollars. Wil Wheaton's show Tabletop on Geek &amp; Sundry gets a lot of the credit for bringing hobby games to the mass market and the spotlight of public awareness.

tl;dr: play these games, have an absolute blast, raise board game awareness, make great content, get lots of views.

[**Ca$h n Gun$**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19237/cash-n-guns) (3-6 players, ~30 minutes): Imagine this, the group has just pulled off the greatest bank heist of their careers. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are heaped in a pile on the table in your run-down hideout. But how do you split the money? Evenly? Fat chance. Each players chooses a character, takes 8 ""bullet cards"", and a foam gun (yes! an actual foam pistol!). Through eight rounds players will be trying to off each other in a series of standoffs to split the spoils. Five stacks of cash are flipped over, players choose what their gun will be doing this round (bullet card) and plays it face-down (Click!, Bang!, or Bang Bang Bang!), someone counts down from three, everyone aims their gun at someone else at the table, anyone feeling the pressure has a chance to back down, guns fire (or not) and money is split amongst the unscathed.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Ca$h n Gun$ is tense. It has this ""moment"" that no other game I'm aware of has. As soon as players aim their guns there is a brief moment where everyone looks around the table to see who's shooting who, and everyone will always burst into raucous laughter over the cries of, ""Why are you shooting at me?!""

[**King of Tokyo**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-of-tokyo) (2-6 players, ~30-45 minutes): Relive all of the cheesy Japanese monster movies with the roll of some dice. Designed by Richard Garfield (of Magic: the Gathering fame), King of Tokyo pits players against each other in a knock-down drag-out fight in the middle of Tokyo. Players choose a monster and roll dice Yahtzee-style to take control of Tokyo, destroy each other, heal, and generate energy to buy special abilities. When in Tokyo, a player can smash everyone else into dust, but are also the target of all other players. The last monster standing or the first person with 20 victory points wins.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* King of Tokyo is chaotic. On one turn you can be on top of the world, terrorizing Tokyo and accumulating points, and the next you may be a bloody pulp, retreating to the Pacific Ocean to lick your wounds. Also, there's a dinosaur character for Lee. And a bunny in a huge robot suit.

[**Love Letter**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter) (2-4 players, ~30-45 minutes): Who knew that you could pack so much fun into a 16 card deck? Love Letter sees players trying to deliver a note of their affection to the Princess who is about to ascend the throne. There are 16 cards, each displaying one of eight members of the royal court. Each player draws one card to start the game. On their turn, a player draws a second card, and then plays a card in front of them. Each card is very simple, yet they all hold a lot of strategic depth and can provide a lot of interaction. Players will be using their card to either knock the other players out, or be the player with the highest ranking member of the court when the deck runs out.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Love Letter sets the scene for a lot of deceptive cardplay and even character acting. Every round has that ""ah-ha"" moment when you realize that the guy next to you is holding the King card, and you play a Guard to expose him. Or when you hold the Princess herself, and you use the Baron to knock a lower-ranked member of the court out of the round.

[**Pit**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140/pit) (3-8 players, best with 5-6, ~30-45 minutes): Cornering the stock market. It's more fun than it sounds. Nine random commodity cards are dealt out to each player. The goal is to trade with other players and ""corner the market"" (have all nine cards) of any commodity. Players offer trades by holding up (without revealing) sets of matching commodities and announcing to the other players how many cards they are offering up in a trade. When someone else announces the same number, you can trade cards with them. When a player manages to trade for all nine cards of a given type, he rings a bell (included with the game), announces that he has cornered the market, and then scores points.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Pit is loud, frantic, chaotic, and a classic. Trades are made in real time, so everyone will constantly try to be heard over each other. ""One, one, one."" ""Three, three, three cards."" ""Two, two! Dammit!""

[**The Resistance**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/the-resistance) (5-10 players, ~30 minutes): Oppressive corporations rule the world, but you are part of the Resistance. However, corporate spies are hidden amongst you. Players are secretly given roles of either Resistance (good guys) or Spies (bad guys). Over the course of five rounds, strike teams are formed, voted on, and sent out. But will the Resistance's mission succeed? Or be sabotaged by a Spy? Weed out who the spies are and keep them out of missions, or convince everyone that some other guy is the spy and doom the Resistance to failure.

*Why SourceFed needs to play this game:* Deception. The Resistance is all about deception and politics. Every move you make will rouse suspicion amongst fellow players, and the finger-pointing will never cease.


Five fantastic games that I feel would go over great with the SourceFed hosts, and be some great content for SourceFedNERD! The only issue is length, but all of these can be edited down to their most thrilling points, or can be played to less points. Pit can be found pretty easily at Barnes &amp; Noble. The other four games can only be found at specialty shops or online, all fairly cheaply. (Amazon, CoolStuffInc, Ebay) The exception to this is Ca$h n Gun$, which is currently out of print and pretty hard to get hold of. I would be more than happy to help out in any way with getting these games into the hands of the SF hosts and even teaching the games in some way so that you guys won't have to slave over rulebooks.

Even if this doesn't pan out, hopefully I've opened some eyes to the larger board gaming world. It's not Monopoly, Clue and Trivial Pursuit anymore. Board games have been evolving, and are continuing to at a rapid pace.


Thanks for reading this. Keep up the great work, guys.

Firstly, I would like to congratulate you for 'making it' on the internet. With the help of DeFranco you created content that is interesting, informative, and really established yourself as a alternative outlet for news coverage.

I've been watching for about a year (my first video was 'Community is Back'). In that year Sourcefed has evolved and mostly for the better. However, something very bad has happened.

You have stopped 20 minutes or less of News Coverage. And I mean actual news. Having 2/5 stories about video game releases isn't news.

Yesterday, you uploaded three stories a 'morning mouth off' and 'table talk'. Now this just may be my opinion but the 'morning mouth off' is unnecessary and I'd much rather prefer one story that is reported properly. Table Talk has been on occasion a delight, and it's a real treat for the fans to get to know you better. But with Table Talk we are once again forfeiting a story.

My last bone to pick is with 'Five on Friday'. If the viewers wanted viral videos they wouldn't be subscribed to Sourcefed.  

I know it's a huge think to ask, but please get back to what made you all great in the first place. News delivered by people that made us laugh.

P.s Feeling Good is awesome, it's news that makes us feel good!"	t5_2tiwp	True

[Working demo inside]	senshisentou	88	5	17	"I have a full open letter post originally meant for the SF team [here](http://patrickboelens.com/sourcefight), but here's the short version, plus an explanation for why I'm making this post.
  

**Why I made it**

Due to an injury I found myself with way too much time to kill that I then figured I'd use to make a portfolio piece in the form of a Java game. This game turned into the SourceFight prototype, a game pitting all the SF hosts against each other in a light-hearted 2D fighter style.
  

**First contact**

Since I rather liked how the initial demo turned out I decided to ask for the team's permission to use their likenesses, and perhaps even some recorded lines or input on special moves and the like. Phil's old business email seems to be out of use though, and I can't seem to get a hold of him through Twitter. I did manage to contact Trisha who forwarded it to Phil (if you're reading this, Trisha: thanks again!!), but I haven't heard anything from him since. If Phil's anything like me chances are he just completely forgot about it. That, or he thinks I'm some sort of spambot by now and blocked me everywhere... Either or, really. =P
  

**Moving forward**

Basically this is my last-ditch effort to revive this project. I would absolutely  *love* to keep working on this game, both because I think it'd make a great portfolio piece and because I have great fun working on this particular project, but I can't invest a huge amount of time into something that may not be appreciated to be out there by the people it's depicting. I hope we can keep this post near the top of the page for a bit so Phil can see it, and hopefully provide a response.
  

**Links**

* Video: http://patrickboelens.com/sites/default/files/sourcefight/Pitch.mov
* Playable demo (cross-platform): http://patrickboelens.com/sites/default/files/sourcefight/SourceFight.zip

I hope you guys like it and will help me get Phil and co. to see it. If not... Just don't downvote me to oblivion please. =P

Cheers,
Patrick"	t5_2tiwp	True

So how about we do this. Every day at around noon EST someone post a table talk for that day titled ""Table Talk for (Insert day and date here)"" That way i think it will be easier than having a hundred posts flooding the page. That way the SF crew can just click that single link and just scroll down and see the ones we upvote from there. 

Hows that sound? 

Edit1: Lets try and get it upvoted so others can see this. In not really looking for karma, just an easier way for us to submit questions and topics.
 
Edit2: Maybe instead of doing it one for every day, we can do one for the whole week. Really just depends on how many questions get posted on each daily thread.

Edit3: It looks like someone already had the idea before i did. [Here is the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/1c4hb7/table_talk_thread_41113/)

Edit4: I am willing to help moderate the page when it comes time to submit questions. For now I'll post the table talk Thread and You guys can add your questions freely. Ill Post Basic rules for us to follow on there as well. 

**Edit5:** I have posted a new thread for today that has a set of basic rules that we can follow when submitting topics. Ill post those rules on every thread that way people will understand how things operate. "	t5_2tiwp	True

I'm sure much of the nation has been. For the longest time I would just browse the front page. Maybe follow a few popular YouTubers. I think it's safe to say things are different, partnerships and all. It wasn't till a few years later I found sxephil. It was (and still doesn't fail to be) amazing. 
     Then Sourcefed came along and that was it. I was positive I had found my favorite channel. Watching Sourcefed grow from a small and what I would presume was an experimental channel was just different. In a good way of course. 
     Now I always look forward to watching the whole crew every day. It is and has always been like none other on YouTube. SIDENOTE: It probably seemed as if I was just fanning out on SF. That may be true BUT, I just wanted to share how great its been watching Sourcefed grow and I'm sure the rest of the nation could agree (at least in some sense.) "	t5_2tiwp	True

I love each episode, but it's unfortunate that they're so short. A longer (monthly?) 45-60 minute Table Talk discussion would be appealing, simple to edit, and add more time for great content.

If they were sponsored, the option to host guests/YouTube personalities would be a smart consideration. I'm a big fan of [Olan Rogers](http://www.youtube.com/user/OlanRogers), and to encourage both fan bases to watch a Table Talk would be a win-win-win-win for everyone.

1372453659.0	1h9u8o	I have an idea for a game SFN can play: Murder	MissMaris21	42	4	9	"This game was always played at my high school for overnight stays and it's the best thing ever. What you do is get a crap load of people, a deck of cards, and dim lighting (dark enough to be able to sneak around and film but not pitch black). Take out all jacks, queens, kings, and aces in the deck except for one ace and one king, plus the remaining number cards for however many people are playing minus two. Mix and distribute the cards to everyone, and don't let anyone else see the card. The king is the murderer, and the ace is the detective. Number cards are civilians. Don't announce what you are. Once everyone has their card, turn down the lights and run for your life. The aim of the murderer is to sneak up behind people and quietly whisper ""Murder"". That person must then lie down and be ""dead"". The murderer can move their body or leave them there, and continue on. If anyone comes across a body, they immediately yell ""MURDER!!"" and everyone runs back to the meeting point. The detective can now choose whether or not to reveal themselves in order to try and guess who the murderer is. They don't have to. If they do, they are allowed to ask one yes or no question of each dead person about the identity of the murderer (example: do they have blonde hair, are they wearing blue, etc.) Once that is over, the next round begins. Everyone who was not killed runs out again. The game continues until the murderer is caught, or the detective is killed. It sounds really complicated typing all this out, but it's really simple once you start playing! The best part is being the murderer and figuring out whether to just go in and get people left and right, or strategically gain the trust of someone their hiding with to get them. It's best to play with a large group, so get the whole office involved!"	t5_2tiwp	True

Suffice to say we spent about 2-3 hours in fits of laughter, and my wife is now a huge Sourcefed fan who wants to get posters and tshirts and autographs from all the Sourcefed Nerd crew.

3. Winner﻿ creates a milkshake out of three food items that are completely incompatible and loser drinks it.

It becomes distorted and forces me to grab the remote or lunge for my laptops volume button to save mine and my neighbors ears.

Seriously guys, it's like watching a poorly mixed film where you can't hear them speak but when the explosion from the aliens mother ship occurs, it is earth shattering loud.

Or like when watching TV and the first cheap local commercial comes on and the volume doubles in... well in volume I guess.

1374619201.0	1iwzyc	Meg raised a great point on Comic Con	coolbeaNs92	30	4	11	"So I was just watching the video ""Comic-Con Not for Nerds?!"" and I thought Meg raised a lot of excellent points not only about Comic Con, but also a lot of nerd culture as a whole. 

I feel there is quite a stigma in the last couple of years with people finding out about new things they like, only to be kinda cast out by the ""old timers"" who seem to resent people who are just only coming into a franchise or a group or any culture that has been around for a long time.

Because a lot of nerd culture is now becoming more mainstream with popular comics becoming films such as Avengers, Thor, C.America and a long list of other titles,  I do see this kinda resentment towards new fans, and it's crazy. 

People who have been fans a long time should be welcoming new people to the mix and showing them what an awesome community there is, not casting them aside. New followers means more money for the franchises to make more awesome content for both new and old. Say for example, Joss Whedon. I watched Buffy/Angel/Firefly live. Now, if Joss would of had as bigger following as he does now because of new fans, Angel would of got a season six. Firefly would of got many more seasons, and Buffy would of easily got an animated show that Joss made a pilot for, but it got turned down. 

To summarise, new fans are awesome. They make studios more aware and higher ups are now starting to realises that massive amount of attention these franchises that they thought were obsolete, now have. Yes, Comic Con has changed. It's not the die hard comic book convention it once was, but that's okay. Why are some trying to hinder the growth of amazing talent because they want to hold on to how things were in the past. I got into comic books because I started reading Buffy Season 8 and it sparked a new found love for comics and I branched out into loads of other franchises because of television. 

TLDR; Love new fans, embrace the new generation, don't cast newcomers out in the harsh cold but show them the path to awesomeness. More people = more content and more money for new companies who are just starting out to make awesome content. 

Just my thoughts anyway :) "	t5_2tiwp	True
1374472856.0	1isopg	is it time for steve to take a break?	Seiryth	175	149	138	"Hey All,

I normally love the show, but the comic-con video's containing steve this year were really, really hard to watch. i found myself feeling bad for the people he had insulted @ comic-con, his delivery on camera was abrasive and overall i feel like sourcefed nerd could be better without him. every second line out of him lately has been a fart joke or something outright crude such as ""hey i just found out my dad is dead"". thats really insensitive, and concidering phil has a father that is ill im suprised it was allowed to be edited and then put up.  you've got a lot of easily influenced teenagers watching your channel and i'd expect you guys to show some sense of responsibility there. 

when he first started on sourcefed, i honestly thought he was a talented guy with a good future ahead of him. i'm not quite sure what has changed, but he's gotten more abrasive and childish as time has gone on to the point where his jokes are so out of place when paired with the rest of the sourcefed team it sometimes comes across as completely unneeded.

sourcefed fans and team - i love your work, i love the channel and im not here just to hate on steve. its because i like the channel so much that i just think someone at sourcefed maybe needs to tell him to turn it down one notch on the ""in your face"" factor. its coming unwatchable when he's around, and thats really sad. 

anyway, keep up the good work and im sure to get flamed for my opinion on this, but i felt like it had to be said!"	t5_2tiwp	True

1371861815.0	1gtwe6	An Open Discussion Thread: My Thoughts On R/SourceFed	CeeEsTee	32	15	39	"**Preface**

This is a long text post detailing my personal thoughts on how this subreddit relates to SourceFed as a Youtube Channel. Wall of text ahead, beware.



Several people have pointed out that the content here on /r/sourcefed leaves something to be desired, and I concur with this, so I would like to have an open discussion about what the community would like to see out of this subreddit. This is an open letter to the subscribers of this subreddit, the mods, and DeFranco Inc. 

Please respond to me with your detailed opinions, I will make an effort to reply to all legitimate feedback to encourage continued discussion.

**Current Content**

**N**ow let's get the obvious out of the way. All of the SourceFed hosts are quite attractive, and so some objectification is inevitable, but I don't think that revealing pictures and GIFs of any of the hosts make for very interesting or engaging discussion. If you look through the comments section of these posts most of what you find there is tripe, complaints about the quality of the content, or other crude remarks. I understand that most of this audience sees this as innocuous fun, and that that is the content that is easily made and upvoted, but I still believe we should strive for a higher ideal.

**I** propose we create either a tagging system to sort the posts, or even a separate subreddit, like ""/r/sourcefednsfw"" in order to allow people to avoid the content if they so choose. 

**N**ot everyone appreciates Trisha solely for her boobs, or Joe exclusively for his mustache/beard. (Also, please bring the 'stache back). Both the hosts and subscribers should have a right to avoid this content if they wish.

**O**bviously this is a fine line we will have to walk, but I would look to the mods to enforce whatever rules are decided upon. 

**Future Content**

**I** also have some questions for the moderators of /r/sourcefed. How active do you consider yourselves to be on the subreddit? It is only occasionally that you create a legitimate thread for the Table Talk discussion posts, is there a mechanism in place that I am not aware of? Could we establish a more consistent system, or at least publicize the current one a little more? It makes me wonder how discussion topics are pulled of the subreddit at all right now. I realize that inactivity isn't completely your fault, as not very many Defranco Inc. Employees seem to be involved in the subreddit, but I still feel a better job could be done on a day-to-day basis.

**I** don't expect overnight change, and I will help however I can, but I would like to know that a plan is in place.

**A**lso, I think a running discussion post for all the previous days videos would be useful. It could even be mixed in with the Table Talk questions post in order to create a continuing dialogue between the Hosts and the denizens of this subreddit, which I think would lend a substantial amount of traffic to this little corner of Reddit. 

**Summary**

**I** enjoy both SourceFed and Phil's videos very much, and I just want to see this community thrive. I think that while the objectification of the hosts is mostly harmless, we should be able to avoid it if we wish. I'm a little sick of garbage posts sitting at the top of the subreddit for days, while other potentially great posts fade into the black. 

**W**hat are *your* thoughts /r/sourcefed? Am I way off base? Let me know what you think. 

**I** want this to be an open dialogue so I can contribute to the community in a way that will please everyone.

**TL;DR**: I care about /r/sourcefed. Just go read the post when you have time.

1376600875.0	1kg0e5	"""A new channel every three months starting in October"" - Latest Phil Vlog"	coolbeaNs92	25	6	20	"So, in Phil's latest [vlog he just posted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCESanyOoTA), he states that he **hopes** to start a new channel every [three months starting in October](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yCESanyOoTA&amp;t=324). 

This sounds awesome, but I have to ask, is there a point where there is *too* much content? When you really love something as much as I'm sure we all do like SourceFed and everything created by Phil, it's hard to say ""maybe not so much content"". 

It seems kinda funny how six years ago I was saying ""we NEED more of your awesomeness!"", but now I'm starting to say ""I'm struggling to keep up with this awesomeness"". Maybe I'm a tad older than the average demographic but with College, work and all that other jazz, I'm starting to kinda struggle to keep up.

So many question is to you guys, do you think there is even is a thing as too much content? Do you ever struggle to keep up with all the content (PDS, SourceFed/Nerd)? Interested to know if it's just me who's struggling to keep up. I honestly think that if another channel was launched that released daily videos, I wouldn't be able to keep up with all the content. 

Just to be clear as well, I'm not saying it's a bad idea at all, I'm just interested in peoples ideas about amount of content vs how much time they have each day to watch videos. 

**edit**

I think some people have taken my post in a different direction than I had set out. I never intended to insinuate that having more channels was a bad idea at all, I was simply trying to gauge peoples opinions on the growing amount of content and how things have changed, and that would people become more selective about the content instead of watching everything. 

I couldn't be more pleased with the rate at which Defranco Inc is growing, I merely wanted to see if people felt the same that they could no longer watch everything and would maybe start being more selective.  "	t5_2tiwp	True

-
Best to worst methods for cleaning overall:
1. Bidet
-
2. Wet toilet paper (In order for friction to not cause paper to fall apart when wet, 4 connected sheets of 2 ply paper was folded in 1/2 then again in 1/3 resulting in 6 layers)
-
3. Baby wipes / Moist cloth
-
4. Dry toilet paper
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros/cons of each:

Bidet - Cleans very effectively and thoroughly no need for TP / Wastes water, not widely available

~

Wet toilet paper - Cleaned just as effective if not slightly better as Bidet and baby wipes, less water waste than Bidet, more comfortable than dry TP / Time consuming

~

Baby wipes - Cleaned as effective as wet toilet paper, no water waste / Baby wipes take 16000% longer to breakdown in the sewer system than toilet paper, some use detergents which may lead to drying out of the sphincter and cause cracking/bleeding and possible infection, Costly

~

Dry toilet paper - None / Worst performer of testing group, left fecal matter, irritated sphincter area, fecal matter can bleed through sheets contaminating hands 

~

Basically if you need to wipe, dry TP is your worst choice, Wet TP is best if you don't own a bidet, bidets are best, baby wipes are meh.

~

Results were achieved through a combination of surveys (Comfort, cost) and actual testing (Clean up ability, breaking down tests)

~

Side note too, Expensive toilet paper cleaned about the same as cheap toilet paper

~

**PLEASE  READ THE RULES.**

Rule #1. Keep your questions professional. The SF crew has already asked us what kind of topics they want submitted. They want us to give them questions that can spark debates and/or tell good stories. 

Rule #2. Do **NOT** spam your questions every day. If your question does not get the most upvotes, dont think it will change the next day. Adding more comments to a thread will only make it harder to find the good ones.

Rule #3. Please check the thread to see if your question, or a similar form of it, has already been asked for that day. No point in having the same kind of comment in the thread twice. 

Rule #4. This thread is as much your responsibility as it is the moderator's. It takes your guys help to upvote good comments, but **DO NOT** downvote someones comment to hell if it isn't interesting. That comment will make its way down to the bottom of the list naturally if you don't upvote it. 

The SF team has given us a chance to voice our opinions directly to them by using this site to submit topics, so lets not make a mess out of it. Lets show our appreciation and love for them by making things run smoothly and efficiently for them. 

Thank you guys.

My name is Magicmanx3 and I have been a fan of SourceFed since its first interation as 20 minutes of less and every iteration thereafter. I along with /u/iamacannibal were chosen by you guys as community moderators for this sub which we are forever grateful. /u/Kixwiz, /u/iamacannibal, the SourceFed Team, and myself are all working to make this a more active community with more interaction with the Defranco Inc team. As such 


As you have probably noticed this entire subreddit has gone through some significant changes over the past 4 days. We have moved through all of the backlog of posts and changed formatting on the page. (Well mostly /u/iamacannibal has done the changes since he has taught himself CSS like a boss). Some changes were liked some changes were disliked (cough downvote cough cough). And still other changes are in the works.


As all of this is being done for the community as a whole, we would like to have your input on the changes. What do you want this community to be about? What ideas do you have that would make this subreddit great? Is there anything you would like to see less? More? I am excited to get this sub building followers and subscribers and would love to get your input. And, as everyone at SourceFed says at the end of their videos, leave a comment down below and tell us what you think.

For the uber nerdy people here are some I find amazing. 

* [Nerd Poker](http://www.earwolf.com/show/nerd-poker/)- Comedian Brian Posehn and friends go and play D&amp;D together and record it. Some of the most fun I have listened to and really makes me want to start a game.

* [Cast of Thrones](http://castofthrones.com/)- A podcast for all of you GoT fans that follows each season episode by episode unpacking all of the mounds of information into easily consumed chunks. 

* [Talking Toons](http://robpaulsenlive.com/category/podcasts/)- A podcast where Rob Paulsen (Voice of Wacko Warner, Freakazoid, and MANY others) interviews other voice actors. For all of you cartoon fans out there this is a MUST listen.

* [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/) A great listen about random things you think about but never really look up. 

For those looking for those celebrities you want to learn more about..

* [The Nerdist](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/nerdist/)- This has been around for a few years now and the backlog is a whose who of hollywood and television. I believe he has interviewed most of the new generation Doctors so take a listen.

* [WTF with Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast)- The granddaddy of them all Marc Maron has sat down and interviewed almost every comedian you have ever heard of and then some. I highly reccomend listening to the Louis C.K. episode. 

* [Girl on Guy](http://girlonguy.net/)- Hosted by Aisha Tyler (Voice of Lana from Archer, also many other things) , she interviews from a slightly more feminine perspective but all very interesting. Take a listen to the latest one with Geri Ryan. 

Straight up comedy podcasts

* [Improv4Humans](http://www.earwolf.com/show/improv4humans/)- Very funny Show with MAtt Besser from the UCB. Multiple improv sketches per show that I find hysterical.

* [Comedy Bang Bang](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/)- A fun interview based show that always gets interrupted by improv characters. Paul F Thompkins is a regular and this is freaking hysterical, Highest recommend on this list.

* [Doug Loves Movies](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/doug-loves-movies/id281816774)- Though he did diss Ross many years ago I still love this podcast. Essentially a name that tune game show but with movies. He has on comedians and actors alike and all in all a really fun show that is a quick hour.

* [ SModcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/smodcast-smodcast/id215010467)- A Podcast that has been going on for almost 5 years now, Kevin smith and his producer Scott Mosier go through their trials and make up shit along the way. A show filled with hypotheticals, and hillarious scenarios that has always made me laugh.


Ok that is it for now. Please let me know if you have any others you listen too that I could get into. I love finding new laughs and I always want to share the ones I listen to. I hope you enjoy these ones.

Oh and btw for all those requesting a PhillyD podcast, he made one at the beginning of last year. Check it out [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/philip-defrancos-overphlow/id514745291?mt=2)

My name is Sara, and I'm a blogger with SourceFedNews.com

Right now we're in the middle of overhauling the Subreddit to make it as awesome as possible for you guys!

First, there will be more moderators on here to make sure that this place is actively looked after. Right now, only Defranco Inc. staff will be invited to moderate.

When it comes to Table Talk, starting this coming Monday (05-13) there will be a weekly table talk post for you guys to post your topics to. Any other submissions that show up as individual posts will be removed to make sure that the sub doesn't get cluttered with TT posts.

It's going to be a little bit while we get things organized around here. We love getting feedback on what's going on and what needs to change. You can feel free to message myself or my fellow blogger, bloggersamb on what you think could be done to make this subreddit a happy experience for everyone.

Nerfle	16	4	6	"This small corner of the Defranco nation is blessed with bird eating spiders, box jellyfish, great white sharks, and eight of the ten most deadly snakes on the planet. We also happen to have a voting system where you rank your candidates from most preferred to least preferred, preventing candidates with similar policies from getting a low number of votes. 

This voting system caused our last election to show that we don't particularly like any of our parties collectively, with a hung parliament and desperate coalitions forming to give a labour (our leftish party) victory. 

This occurred several months after Gillard kicked Rudd out of running his own party, something which was just reversed. It's confused the fuck out of our northern neighbours though. 

The right leaning coalition, headed by the liberals (just go with it) has been dominating the polls recently and this new change is supposed to change that before the next election. 

The primary policy arguments between the several sides are: 
Asylum seekers (lovingly called boat people)
The carbon tax
Immigration
Welfare reform 
Superannuation
The mining tax
Derivative investments of the future fund
Gay marriage

17 days ago a garment factory collapsed on its workers in Bangladesh. There was a huge controversy because the managers made the people come to work even though they were told they shouldn't because of a wall collapse the day before. After the collapse the main owner fled but was later caught trying to leave the country. At this point the death count is above 1000 and they are still searching. But yesterday they found a lady who had been under the ruble for 17 days. She was stuck in a mosque under the building. She had some food and room to move around and luckily survived until workers saw a moving rod and saved her. Though she is physically fine she is going thru some major PTSD. Also all of these people were very poor and most were young. Please cover this story because very few people outside the south-Asian communities know about it. Here's a link to an article that talks about it. You can also just Google Bangladesh Building Collapse and find lots of info. Thanks.

*  The original Resident Evil series for the playstation 


* Final Fantasy all of them. This series makes you fall in love with so many different characters and truly takes you on a journey.


*  Mass Effect this is one of the greatest stories ever told.


*  The Walking Dead not the crappy hicktown fps. This is a game that makes every decision feel like the weight of the world is behind it. There are intense moments as well as tear jerking hit you right in the feels moments. Classic.


*  Gears of War you play as a marine fighting a losing battle against an enemy that seems to have no end or weakness. Loved the story telling and atmosphere of the game.


* Metal Gear Solid Solid Snake nuff said.


* Kotor I spent hundreds of hours playing this game growing up. The voice over and dialog options and story telling are so immersive its still to this day an amazing game.


* Red Dead Redemption this game is one of rockstars best games in my opinion. I felt connected to the main character. The way they captured how living in wild west and during that time is the best to date. 


* Bioshock this series is regarded by many to be the best story ever told by a video game. I think it's a great story and a great series of games. 


* Deadlight this is a game many of you might not be familiar with. It's a very atmospheric side scrolling zombie apocalypse game. The mood set in this game is top notch and it feels like you are in a graphic novel. It's one of my favorite games.

This list is my opinion you may think I'm insane, that's ok. Let me know what you guys think."	t5_2tiwp	True

I'm sure there are debates in the SF HQ about which stories are more important to cover than others, but it would be neat if Sourcefed could cover everything. 

I was thinking of a new show idea called, ""ForceFed"" where the hosts put out one show a week/day like their regular ones with a sort of 'lightning-round' feel to it. Maybe one host relays the headline of the story and the other elaborates on it for a few seconds and then they go right on to the next one.

I am more entertained by the Table Talk format because, similar to listening to a podcast, you get to hear their personal views on certain topics and learn more about who they are. I suppose it just makes me more invested in those videos.

I only bring this up because I hope you guys continue the videos with multiple people having an honest, unscripted conversation. I don't think I am alone in saying that those are the videos that keep bringing me back.

Newspaper: http://www.friatider.se/nu-tar-lotteriinspektionen-skatt-for-lan-spel

Translated version: 

New lance cat affects gamers
- At least 3 000 Kronor per country in new tax
Published June 26, 2013 at 17:55
NEW TAX. Just days after a Swedish court announced that the computers will be subject to a special computer tax to finance public broadcasting received yet another shock. ""LAN play requires a permit,"" writes the Gaming Board in a recent decision.
The organizer of the so-called country will now be required to pay a fee of up to 35,000 Kronor to get permission, according to a new decision by the Gaming Board as the supervisory authority for gambling and lottery in Sweden.
The decision is a result of the new law of the Supreme Administrative Court received since Reinfeldt government revised slot regulation last year.
Also video games under the new authorization.
- In the eyes of the law, this is the slot machines. There is no difference, says Johan Röhr, general counsel at the Gaming Board, the gadget and computer magazine M3.
According to Johan Röhr, the new rules do not, for example, Internet cafes, where computers are mainly for other than gaming.
In addition to tax may apply an inspection of the Gaming Board is to make supervision during a lanparty.
The new lance cat gets criticized by Erik de Basso, Accounting Manager at lanhallen Inferno Online, which now is the first activity that is coated with the new tax. The company affected thereby an additional cost of thousands of dollars per year.
- They equate our business to go and playing Donkey Kong at the pub. It's clear they get pissed, he says to M3.
Gaming Board now invites all companies and economic associations which organize games on computers in lanenvirement or the Internet to seek authorization from the Authority. For purely private lanpartys needed so far no permission. A permit is valid for two years.

This is effed up if you ask me. Think about Dreamhack and other lans like it. Even thou DH make alot more this is still a shitty law if you ask me. I'd like to know what you guys think about it."	t5_2tiwp	True

Being partially deaf myself, I generally watch everything with subtitles on. There are a few times where I wish Sourcefed had subtitles so I actually knew what Elliot was steamrolling in that way he does, etc. But I wish I could share these videos with my impaired friends and family as well.

I humbly ask that you consider adding subtitles to your videos, so that your special brand of news reporting can reach a wider audience, and be more accessible to the audience you currently have. A wonderful resource I have used for these endevours of my own is a crowd-sourcing tool at Amara.org, where people link Youtube videos and add their own subtitles. It is very efficient, and would take very little time for your videos to do so.

Based on the game FIFA (Football/Soccer)

You could work these types of rules around any multiplayer competitive game that is based on score, or whatever!! 

So,

If you lose by said amount you do the forfeit! 
i.e. You lose 5 - 0, Facebook Apology. 

And it is if you lose by 5, 6 or 7. So, the score could be 7 - 2 or 8 - 3.


These are the official and ORIGINAL rules for FIFA!

First rule of FIFA, you lose and face the consequences!

Lose by the following and face up to the forfeit;

5 - Write a Facebook apology to your opponent praising them for their brilliance.

6 - You must kiss the feet of your opponent.

However, I look at the content of the SourceFed videos and think: ""This is mostly US news..."" It's interesting to see and all but as someone who prefers to get news online, I'd like an outlet for news that's closer to home that's as entertaining as SourceFed, because frankly, news presenters are boring as all hell.

1365754874.0	1c71qv	For Steve - When you become a man	forge7960	9	5	2	"Just watched table talk and had to say something. A boy becomes a man when he is 13. A man becomes an adult when he can place the needs of others above his own selfish desires. With that said, there are certain things men are expected to know how to do on a cellular level. Here is a list and Joe and Meg can back me up on it because lets face it they're the manliest of your crew. 

1. Make fire.
2. Change a tire.
3. Know one good dirty joke. 
4. Barbeque.
5. Bait a hook.
6. Use jumper cables. 
7. Be able to intruct another male in proper shaving technique. 
8. Deal with bugs, snakes, burglars and other creepy crawlies with extreme prejudice.
9. Go camping.
10. Write your name or someone you love's name in pee. 
11. Throw a ball properly.
12. Hit a ball.
13. Ride a bicycle.
14. Defend a woman's honor.
15. Know basic first aid. 
16. Have a set of tools and know the difference between a standard and philipshead screwdriver.

These are just the basics. If you really want to impress...
1. Learn to play an instrument .
2. Know how to change a diaper, Grandma's or baby's are equally impressive. 
3. Know how to give a decent 10 minute massage.
4. Be able to cook one full meal.
5. Remember to put the toilet seat down without being asked. 
6. Anticipate a friend's or significant other's needs and take the initiative to meet them. 
7. Practice the law of reciprocity, the Golden Rule, and always treat others how you would like them to treat you.

I think you nail most of the advanced manly things but, don't forget the basics. They come in handy and are always a great story for the first time you tried them."	t5_2tiwp	True
