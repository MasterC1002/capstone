At first she developed hind leg paralysis, but could still drag herself around, so I would wheelbarrow her, lifting her rear end while she walked around.  Eventually, she couldn't get around much at all, and couldn't see very well, so I started giving her smell tours.

I would pick her up and pet her, then carry her all around the house to smell various things.  After holding her in front of something for a couple seconds, she would notice it and start sniffing and making happy noises.  She would smell rat food, people food, candles, garbage, and anything else I could thing of that had a smell she might enjoy.

If you have a rat whose mobility is not what it used to be, I recommend trying a smell tour, because it may just be the thing to cheer up an old rat."	t5_2qnh3	True
