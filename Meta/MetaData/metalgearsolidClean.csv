SGTShow	290	58	44	"Me and my brother were both United States Marines. We grew up with Metal gear as our game of choice. What I am asking is an opportunity to have my Brother RHETT HAIR as just a GRU, or Cyborg or any member of the game that can have a Dog Tag pulled from. That would mean the world to me and what is rest of my family. We both went to war multiple times because it was the right thing to do.  If any of you fine folks can push for this I would greatly appreciate it.  It kills me to write this, but this is the very least he deserves. Thank you for reading.

1364474949.0	1b69sw	An attempt to clean this mess up:	MrFernandez	194	21	137	"*A lot of you are very confused and are throwing around theories that aren't faithful to the Metal Gear universe. Let me clarify some things to help you in drawing up these elaborate theories:*

1-The events of MGS5 i.e Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, take place **AFTER** Peace Walker. Peace Walker takes place two years **AFTER** the Les Enfant Terribles project. It logically follows that MGS5 takes place **AFTER** the Les Enfant Terribles project. 

2-The coma detailed in the Phantom Pain trailer has nothing to do with the Les Enfant Terribles project. That's already done and dusted.

3- The events shown in the Ground Zeroes trailer take place after Peace Walker(see above and the trailer).  The Phantom Pain takes place 9 years after Ground Zeroes.  The year is **at least 1983** when Big Boss wakes up from the coma shown in the Phantom Pain trailer(s). **That's 11 years after the Les Enfant Terribles Project**.

What events do we know transpired during the 1980s in the Metal Gear universe? Here:

(i)1980: Naomi Hunter rescued by Big Boss and Gray Fox. Big Boss sends Naomi to America. A strong indication that Gray Fox will be in MGSV.

(ii) Raiden born in the early 80s.

(iii) In the late 80s, Solidus, only a teenager but older in appearance, partakes in the Liberian Civil war. Indicates that Big Boss' clones are capable of fighting during this time period.

(iv) VR developed.

**Some obvious info that can be gathered from the trailers:**

The Ground Zeroes trailer talks of a ""UN nuclear inspection"" of Mother Base. **This is most likely a trap:**

-[""The Trojan Horse's in""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m24s) i.e The trap has been set up.

-Burnt-face XOF commander hides their identity([removes XOF logo from the choppers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m15s) and their [uniforms)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=06m31s) before departing. Maybe so that they can literally land on Mother Base and attack from the inside.

[""The pirate crackdown's a go""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m38s) i.e Lets kill these mercenaries once and for all.

The ""inspection"" is actually XOF launching a surprise attack on Mother Base and subsequently destroying it. XOF may be responsible for Big Boss' 9 year coma.

**Something not so obvious:**

Both Phantom Pain trailers and the gameplay would suggest that **the supernatural entities seen invading the hospital are not there to kill Big Boss, but possibly to protect him**.

(i) The XOF soldiers invading the hospital seem to be killing everyone with knowledge that Big Boss is there. They clearly want to kill Big Boss. [If you view this segment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqA37wGqg9Q&amp;t=02m03s) of the original Phantom Pain trailer, you'll see that the XOF soldiers mow down a group of patients, clearly disregarding whether or not one of them is Big Boss. Just as they're seemingly about to kill Big Boss, the clip changes. Now, we see the same hallway in flames with Big Boss still alive and no XOF soldiers to be seen.  **The fiery phantom quite clearly killed the XOF soldiers just as they were about to kill Big Boss**.

(ii)That [fiery whale phantom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqA37wGqg9Q&amp;t=02m34s) also destroys what's most likely an XOF chopper, again protecting Big Boss.

(iii)Finally,[ we see an XOF soldier about to kill Big Boss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqA37wGqg9Q&amp;t=02m44s), only to be interrupted by the Psycho-Mantis-like being. The XOF soldier is clearly started by its presence as he quickly looks up. A supernatural entity once again protects Big Boss.

Props to /u/DrunkenSavior for [the following contribution](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1b69sw/an_attempt_to_clean_this_mess_up/c947ayd): 


**I'm actually thinking the exact time-period for Big Boss' 9-year coma is 1980-1989.**

1974 - Peace Walker Incident

1980 - After the Rhodesian Bush War (July 1964 - Dec 1979), Big Boss takes Naomi Hunter to the United States.

Late 1980s - Outer Heaven fortress formed.

Late 1980s - Big Boss takes control of FOXHOUND.

Another event that could have occurred around this time period was Big Boss rescuing Frank Jaeger during the Mozambican Civil War. However, the Mozambican Civil War was from 1977-1992 so suggesting that Big Boss rescued Jaeger either during the time periods of 1977-1980 or 1989-1992 isn't too much of a stretch.

**It's hard to find any other 9-year period in the Metal Gear timeline where Big Boss is inactive that fits between Peace Walker(1974) and Metal Gear (1995).**

**On a side note, here's some interesting tidbits about my 1989 theory:**

a) It means that the Les Enfants Terribles program would be 17 years old, meaning Snake and Liquid are both 17 at the oldest. This makes sense because Solid Snake's first war theater was Iraq in 1991, which means he would be 19. His claim to fame was the events in METAL GEAR, which takes place in 1995 which makes Snake 24 years old.

b) If Big Boss does wake up in 1989, that means that Ocelot is about 45, Psycho Mantis is around 19, and Big Boss himself is 54.

Since there are nearly 7,000 of us here (wow!) I decided it's probably a good time to do another census survey. This is strictly for fun, I'm not using this data for anything and it's totally anonymous. What's going to happen is that in a week or so I will just make another post with the results because it's interesting to see the demographic we have going on here.

What sparked interest in this initially is the fact that I get a lot of moderator mail saying 'brother' and 'boss' and it makes me smile because most of you probably don't assume I am a 21 year old female, hence making me want to find out who YOU guys are, since you make this community what it is.

So, if you could please take the survey, it'd really help out. It should take you no longer than 5 minutes. It will be cool. I promise.

If you're struggling with what order you should play these wonderful games in, fret not!

I'm going to clear it up in this post.

To put it simply, for the BEST overall satisfaction, it is *highly* recommended that you play the games in order of release and NOT chronological order.

___________________

The release order (most recommended) is as follows:

* Metal Gear*
* Metal Gear 2*
* Metal Gear Solid (1)
* Metal Gear Solid 2
* Metal Gear Solid 3
* Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops*
* Metal Gear Solid 4
* Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
* Metal Gear Rising*

**The titles with a * next to them are voted *most optional* by fans and are not necessarily needed to enjoy the story to its full potential.** Starting with Metal Gear Solid 1 is *perfectly* fine. You don't need MG1 and MG2 to understand the story, but it will help with the overall tone if you want to.
___________________

* The **[Legacy Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Collection-Playstation-3/dp/B00CTKHXFO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376545415&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=metal+gear+solid+legacy+collection)** is very helpful to someone who has never played any games in the series nor owns any of them. This will provide you with **Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophy Edition and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition.** That's an astounding deal, just saying. It also includes Metal Gear Solid 1 and VR Missions voucher codes.

* Alternatively, there is the **[HD Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Collection-Playstation-3/dp/B0050SX97I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376545542&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=metal+gear+solid+hd+collection)** which includes **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.**

* Metal Gear Solid 1 is available on the PlayStation Network for $9.99 and is definitely worth the price for the convenience of being able to play it on your PS3 if you no longer own a PS2 and you have a PS3 model, like mine, that is not able to be updated to be reverse compatible.

* Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are tough and rewarding games on their own, but they don't need to necessarily be played before Metal Gear Solid at all. I, personally, and a lot of other people have started with Metal Gear Solid 1 and then followed the series after that. 

_______________

If you really want to be a rebel, or are just curious, this is the chronological order of the games: 

* Metal Gear Solid 3
* Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops
* Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
* Metal Gear
* Metal Gear 2
* Metal Gear Solid 1
* Metal Gear Solid 2
* Metal Gear Solid 4
* Metal Gear Rising

And if you're curious by year:

* 1964 – Snake Eater
* 1970 – Portable Ops
* 1974 – Peace Walker
* 1995 – Metal Gear
* 1999 – Metal Gear 2
* 2005 – Metal Gear Solid
* 2007 – Sons of Liberty
* 2009 – Sons of Liberty (cont.)
* 2014 – Guns of the Patriots
* 2018 – Metal Gear Rising


Please realize if you play the games in this order, you run the risk of being spoiled or very confused at some points and while the experience may still be somewhat enjoyable, it's not recommended.

I hope this answers most questions you have and if you still have questions, feel free to make a post asking about it. I hope this will help clear up the front page of this subreddit by eliminating the ""Which game should I play first?"" questions.

If you haven't been around long, make sure to pick out your flair and get involved in the discussions we have here! We're pretty cool.

1358181110.0	16k2hf	Proposed merger with /r/metalgear?	Cee-Jay	141	17	53	"Anybody think we should merge with/r/metalgear? They're a much smaller and far less active subreddit, we could absorb them quite easily. I see no reason not to, really...

Edit: Okay, so there's been a hugely positive response to this idea from you folks. Meanwhile, over in /r/metalgear, the submission hasn't even been seen. If anybody needed convincing that a merger was required, that's it right there, y'ask me. In the interest of fairness to the other sub, however, I'll wait until 24 hours has passed since making this suggestion, and then I'll get onto the mods of both subs concerned.

Edit 2: Alright, well I've sent each of the two subreddit's mods the following message:

&gt; Hi there Killerzeit/mezzism/SnakeLinkSonic/Deadlypuf/Yen24/Ganonsfoot/dbarts21/DOOMz_illa!

&gt; I'm contacting you regarding an idea I proposed in [/r/metalgearsolid]...(http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) and [/r/metalgear](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgear/comments/16k2e4/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgearsolid/) to overwhelmingly positive response; users are interested in the possibility of merging these two subreddits. Specifically, we would like to see the former absorb the latter. 
/r/metalgearsolid would be renamed /r/metalgear, but keep its present look, with the possible addition of crimzind's redesigned subreddit logo as well.

&gt; Users have brought up concerns regarding who the moderator duties should fall to, but I           personally feel that this would be a good opportunity for certain mods to reconsider their interest in the role, and for us to appoint new blood if necessary.

&gt; Please see the discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) for  more information, and feel free to contact me with any additional questions you may have, I'll be happy to field them.

&gt; Yours sincerely,

&gt; Cee-Jay

It's all in their hands now, but the fact that this post received over 120 upvotes and nearly fifty comments, and the identical post in [/r/metalgear](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgear/comments/16k2e4/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgearsolid/) wasn't even seen says a huge amount, I think. Also, I've glanced the activity of each mod, and found /u/Deadlypuf's appointment to the position to be most curious, considering his/her overall activity...

Anyway, many thanks to everyone who replied for their input. It's in the mod's hands now of course, but I'll keep you all informed as to any changes as they take place...

Edit 3: I've been invited to become a mod of /r/metalgear... Since we'll hopefully be running that show soon, I just wanna ask; d'you guys accept me to moderate that subreddit? I'll only take the job if you guys would be happy t'see me in the position, otherwise I'll turn it down, no questions asked."	t5_2s4hr	True

A few days ago, /u/_DD_LLC_ posted a few cryptic things here.  Some quick digging connected him to a YouTube account with only [two videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/Broederbonds/videos), one of them posted very recently.  Most people have blown it off as Trolling, but a quick analysis of the videos proves them to be unusually well thought-out.  **(TL;DR?  Either it's all legit, or the Troll is completely fucking nuts.  Either way, it might be worth investigating further.  If not simply for the sake of fun.)**

The shorter video, [Project Decryption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlKEk3DKtl0), contains two pieces of morse-code:

* Morse text in the video title reads - ""APARTHEID"". (South Africa's long-running racial segregation enforced by the National Party.  Escalating resistance led to a State Of Emergency in the mid 1980's.  Metal Gear lore in mind, this would be an ideal setting for MGSV.)

* The audio plays out like a shortwave radio interception.  African beer commercial music and some shifting radio frequencies followed by a string of morse - ""THE UPRIESING HAS STARTED"" (RIES could be a Kojima in-joke.  Kind of like the whole ""Did you rike it??"" thing.  RIES = LIES.)

The other video, [""loop2.exe""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3GlVMc4PJI), includes The Shins' ""Phantom Limb"" mixed with a variety of odd sound effects and images:

* Before the song begins, there are a series of warped sounds that closely resemble the audio signature for spectrogram-encoded images like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCqlClHGIs8).  I experimented with this using a few free spectrogram applications.  It looks like *something* is there, but I couldn't tease it out.

* Halfway through the song, the volume drops.  Footsteps are heard entering a room where a heart monitor is present.  There are keystrokes, followed by a rapid succession of electronic beeps.  The beeping pattern repeats 3 times and is followed by another warped ""whoosh"" sound.

* [This image](http://i.imgur.com/IsQDr5V.jpg) flashes on screen for 1 frame near the beginning of the video.  It's an Adobe Premiere screenshot reminiscent of [this teaser](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BF3zZd7CIAEUHeH.jpg:large) Kojima posted before GDC.  This time, the name of the project is ""TPP_PAX2013_1080P_ESRB TPP-PAX2013_171"".  As far as I can tell, this picture doesn't appear anywhere else on the web.  Faking something like this is entirely possible, but it would be a HUGE pain in the ass.  [Here is a translation](http://i355.photobucket.com/albums/r463/Frank_W_Pliskin/translate_zpsae8a8c6d.jpg) by /u/Pliskin683.

* [This text](http://i.imgur.com/rRCmikO.jpg) appears while the keystrokes are heard.  We see the user moving into the lita 01 directory, using the Vi editor to edit assembly code (""Copy (2) of loop.asm""), compiling this into executable code (loop2.exe), then running it
Assembly code is about as close as you can get to editing ones and zeros on a machine and it often used if you want something to run very fast, or do a small specific task. It's used quite a lot for writing viruses/exploits, and given we see system errors shortly after it's executed, it's highly likely that that's what loop2.exe is.

* In MGSV context, ""cd Lita 01"" may be referencing Lita Ford - Lead guitarist of The Runaways, whose (awful) solo-career peaked with the release of her second album in 1984.  The (awful) music video for this album's first track sees a morally-sound, ""Good"" Lita having her home invaded.  In order to take revenge on her attackers, she transforms into ""Bad"" Lita, complete with a slick leather jacket.  The (awful) video for her *first* album's first track involves Lita hiring two doctors to kidnap a man.  They knock him unconscious and bring him to a hospital where he is transformed into Lita's guitar.

* [This text](http://i.imgur.com/2r9qOAA.jpg) appears while the beeping pattern is heard.  The information is directly linked to the medical codes in the YouTube description.  Web-searching these codes provides a lot of interesting information regarding neurological treatments for Phantom Limb Syndrome.  Information that seems *very* relevant to MGSV, but hasn't been mentioned in official media releases so far.  The female skeleton in the background is a stock anatomy illustration.

* [This photo](http://i.imgur.com/E6Cf29w.jpg) flashes on screen for 1 frame.  It's an xray from a real medical case where a Chinese man had his *right eye* impaled by a large *hook*.

* [More text](http://i.imgur.com/5Pjf4hF.jpg) referencing the medical codes in the YouTube description.  No apparent source for the animation playing in the background.

* [This photo](http://i.imgur.com/U9RIQkL.jpg) of an old prosthetic arm used by the Army during and after WWII (another flash-frame).  It's nearly identical to the hook worn by Big Boss in MGSV.

* [An error message](http://i.imgur.com/KkonP4H.jpg) appears while loud klaxons sound off in the background.  Nothing much to see here.

* [An error code](http://i.imgur.com/rq4KSaa.jpg) immediately follows the error message.  If there *is* an ARG, this is the most blatant hint we've received so far.  The image is ripped directly from an article on [hacking passwords](http://lifehacker.com/5676258/decode-a-laptop-bios-password-using-a-simple-checksum-script).

* [Another flash-frame.](http://i.imgur.com/2dX4GTe.jpg)  This one is a shrapnel injury from the Korean War.

* [And one more.](http://i.imgur.com/RdK91cg.jpg)  Another Chinese head-trauma case.  This kid survived having a sword *thrown* 5 centimeters into his skull.

**SO, WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?**

While not officially acknowledged by KojiPro, the videos are *loaded* with nods to MGSV.  The overall tone *REEKS* of Kojima's style.  Sources are very obscure, and the information is cleverly presented.  The video editing is well paced, and the audio sounds professionally mixed.  It's obvious that somebody put a lot of work into this.  Maybe Kojima's ""Project Ogre"" isn't a video game at all, but an Alternate Reality Game revolving around a ""Troll"" theme.

There is, of course, the possibility that it's all fake.  Just some crazy fan.  Really crazy...  A super-fan.  But so what?  There may still be a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow.

For anyone genuinely interested in this, here are some things that should be prioritized:

* Identify /u/_DD_LLC_.  This guy has been stirring up mystery on several boards, and exhibiting some shady behavior.  Troll vigilante?  Hired Promotional Merc?  The K-Man himself?  He's changed his YouTube name several times:  ""Ahab Ceely"", ""Prive"", and most recently ""Rev Pi (SCI, T_KEYHOLE: SIGINT:""

* Translating the Adobe screenshot.

* Checking out the hacking article and seeing if it could be used with any information we currently have.

* Analyzing the audio with Spectrogram software, or other audio-to-image decoders.  There are several freeware programs available online.

  
 
*If you discover anything of interest, post it in the comments below.  I'll add anything useful to the post.  Listed below are older leads from previous updates, be sure to check it all out if you haven't already.*
 
 

**WHAT WE NEED TO DO**

ARGs for video games almost always lead to a reward.  This is typically a release date, some kind of special media content (new trailer, comic book, etc.), or exciting new information about the game.

There is likely a message hidden in all these codes that will help move things forward, but the Google connections may also be relevant.  Based on common ARG practices, we may be looking for:

* An IP Address leading to a website involved in the ARG.

* A phone number leading to a voicemail with new ARG information.

* Geological coordinates leading to a physical location with a GeoCache. (Coordinates have already been found.  See ""Other Theories and Discoveries"" below.  There may be another set of more accessible coordinates hidden in the code.)

**USING A CIPHER**

A cipher is a method of encoding/decoding information.  The most simple cipher is replacing letters with their corresponding number in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.).  Most real ciphers are *much* more complicated, but they almost always involve some method of substitution.  Usually, decoding a cipher involves a keyword or password.

A cipher grid is used to organize the characters in a message so they can be more easily viewed in rows or columns.  Most cipher grids are square, but they can use more unusual shapes.  [(example)](https://haqf0w.bn1.livefilestore.com/y2mncxyPRxAD_Wuiro7dwoFZKMJdJ7PARSSLPQ6czj9FlNT5hOZ1yBwz1XGyMIeBqsiyZvzKwuXPfUOz4COlwV7n1mbkL2vEtFKiitDqeYJCFOHqrlzltXYFcbmpRZbEi_5/Pyramid%20Cipher.gif?rdrts=45797440)

A really great collection of browser-based cipher tools can be found **[HERE](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/)**.  They're pretty easy to use, just plug in the message you want to decode (and sometimes a keyword) and the tool will spit out an answer.

**CIPHER IN THE TRAILER?**

Somebody in another forum pointed out that, in the new trailer, certain letters in the text appear to be underlined.  I copied these down to the best of my ability, but somebody should probably double-check (sometimes the underscore sits halfway between two letters).  There are a few instances where it's kind of vague.  The letters are:

I A Y O I O U E H R P R E U L E P E R N N A A I A S K O S C O D U H V I H N E E M N

A total of 42 letters.  Incidentally, here's the clue text from the poster:

A C C A C Q T M V T E S T T W T X K E E V E N T M A C H R U N R E R U N S E C T O R

A total of 42 letters!  But wait, there's more!

The string of letters from the trailer is very close to the Friedman-IC for English, meaning there's a strong possibility it's a scrambled message.  I already checked, and there's over 14,000 different English words you can spell with those letters.

This is pretty clear evidence that, between the letters from the trailer and the clues in the poster, we're looking at a cipher.  One string may be a key for the other, the letters might have to be combined, there's several ways it could be approached.  

We're getting closer!


**THE POSTER CLUES:**

Kojima Productions, via the new episode of [KP Alert!](http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro/radio/kp_alert/kp_alert_003.mp3), has officially stated:  ""[...there are a lot of hints hidden in that poster... zoom in!  zoom in!](http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles//a/1/5/8/9/4/8/9/27.jpg.jpg)"".

**OTHER THEORIES AND DISCOVERIES**

Plugging the clues into google results in a lot of unusual coincidences, including:

* [Coordinates in the Gulf of Guinea](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=-00%C2%B0+23'+46.21%22,+%2B08%C2%B0+35'+21.778%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-0.263671,16.435547&amp;spn=67.15547,135.263672&amp;t=h&amp;z=4) (Near Port-Gentil, a good spot for an operation like Diamond Dogs.)

* [A link to a data block from a genetics experiment](https://www.google.com/search?site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=-00%C2%B0+23%27+46.21%22%2C+%2B08%C2%B0+35%27+21.778%22&amp;oq=-00%C2%B0+23%27+46.21%22%2C+%2B08%C2%B0+35%27+21.778%22&amp;gs_l=hp.12...14913.22326.0.23808.5.5.0.0.0.0.31.135.5.5.0...0.0.0..1c.1.17.hp.zHCfC7VzMjQ) (This particular experiment dealt with protein structures involved in motor-neuron regeneration, good stuff for people stuck in wheelchairs or missing limbs...)

* [A picture of an asteroid passing over the Fox Archipelago](http://www.asteroidoccultation.com/2013_11/1126_1649_31386_Map.gif) (Location of Shadow Moses.)

* [Thalia's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thalia) (Thalia is a latin pop singer.  Kojima exchanged some messages with her one week before E3)

* [Navy order codes](http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/milpersman/1000/1300Assignment/Documents/1320-300.pdf) (Several references to a ""Permanent Change of Station"" and a reference to hospitalization.

* [UPC codes for ""J.D. Ice Cream""](http://i.imgur.com/8oN9NF8.png) (J.D. is the core of the Patriot's AI)

There are some other interesting ideas.  All of the trailers feature a strange lens-flare that resembles a DNA sequence, or possibly morse code.

Some fans are fine with it, while others are in disbelief, and a good chunk are really *really* pissed off. I'm here today to offer some insight into this news and hopefully calm tensions so we can all get back to loving our favorite franchise. So let me start off by saying I'm Pro-Sutherland, but hear me out, I understand why fans may think it's a ruse and why a lot are pissed at this news, but I'm going to explain why you shouldn't, and why it's not all that bad.

**Kojima Be Trollin'**

- *Kojima Never Says Kiefer's Playing Big Boss*

[Yes he does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zp5Kxp7asbc). ""The game takes place in 1984, when Snake is 49 years old. Therefore we needed someone to convey the facial and vocal qualities of a man in his late 40s.""  They make it pretty clear that they're not talking about Solid Snake, or Liquid Snake, or even Solidus Snake. So unless there's another ""Snake"" out there that happens to be the same age as Big Boss in the same time frame(which is very unlikely) we can make the safe assumption that Kojima's confirming Kiefer as Big Boss.

- *Kiefer Never Says He's Playing Big Boss*

[Yes he does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zp5Kxp7asbc). ""Trying to isolate ""What does **Snake** want for the future? And how does the past weigh on him?"" I highly doubt he's talking about an 11 Year-Old Clone weighing on the past. 

- *We never see Kiefer do any Mo-Cap*

[Yeah we do](http://i.imgur.com/CKLwFKm.gif).

- *Every Interview Looks Fake*

That's subjective. Not evidence. And a lot of people are confusing the two. Evidence would be finding a video recording, or a leaked document that confirms something's true or false. Subjective on the other hand is more like an opinion. Saying for example, ""The Moon Landing looks fake"". Is there any evidence that proves it's fake? No. You're simply going by what your gut feeling is telling you, and shoving it down everyone's throats. When the evidence outweighs your gut feeling, then you have to sit back and keep it to yourself because you aren't contributing anything to your cause. And just like the Moon Landing, there's more evidence to support that Kiefer voicing Big Boss is real than your ""gut feeling"". So please, find some evidence if you're so sure that your gut feeling is right.

**Hayters Gonna' Hate!**

- *Hayter Pulled off Old Snake's Voice, Why Not Older Big Boss?*

Well that would lead to some inconsistencies. First of all you can't have David Hayter's Big Boss talking to Hayter's Solid Snake in Outer Heaven. That's a bit much from a narrative standpoint. Also, MGS4 made it *very clear* that Solid Snake is **not** an exact replica of Big Boss despite being a clone. Notice how Old Snake's Voice differs greatly from Richard Doyle's Big Boss during the final Epilogue? Why didn't they have Hayter voice both? Why didn't Hayter voice Liquid and Solidus if they're all clones?! Because that would've been silly and inaccurate. Seriously, it's explained to Snake that neither he, nor Liquid were had the exact DNA of Big Boss otherwise Liquid could have Hijacked SOP earlier in the game. I mean look at [Old Snake and Big Boss](http://i.imgur.com/M32WvJT.jpg). I even gave them similar features to help the comparison, and they still don't look EXACTLY alike. They're not the same person, therefore they don't require the same voice.



- *The Franchise is Ruined without Hayter*

No it's not. Namely because David Hayter didn't direct, design, or in any creative form had anything to do with the development of any game in the Franchise. He's a voice actor. A damn fine Voice Actor at that, but still a voice actor. The gameplay, story, graphics, and immersion that makes the franchise world renown are still there and the game itself won't have any less quality than previous titles.

- *I Refuse to Buy this Game!*

Ok, but you're missing out on an incredible experience unlike anything before it. Kojima is going all out this time, and the FOX Engine is the most advanced piece of game development technology we've seen. It's your own loss as a gamer if you refuse to buy it.

- *Kojima Screwed David Hayter!*

I wouldn't say he *screwed* anybody. As someone in total creative control Kojima has the right to choose whomever he wants if he feels that decision will creative a better gaming experience. It's been said that Mr. Sutherland was chosen because he's better-suited to portray emotions through facial movements than Mr. Hayter. With David Hayter being a *Professional* VA, he knows the ups-and-downs of being turned over for jobs, and should continue what he does with grace. As an example let's look at The Joker. Mark Hamill voiced the Joker for an odd 15 years in various Batman Cartoons, Video Games, etc. However when The Dark Knight was in development they didn't choose Mark Hamill, they chose Heath Ledger. Why? Because while Mark Hamill is a damn fine VA and for many people The penultimate Joker, Heath Ledger was better suited for the job. And to this day Heath Ledger's performance is still revered. The same applies here, Kiefer Sutherland is able to bring something to the table that David Hayter simply can't. And it's going to make a better experience as a result. Did Mark Hamill ever go on Twitter and make a huge fuss about it? No. He didn't. Because that's not what Professionals do.


**Epilogue**

In closing, I think what's setting this massive shift in fan opinion is the fear of change. People are naturally afraid of change because they're afraid that change might be bad. Well you forget that change can be good too! And Kojima has never let us down before. So I sit here in high-hopes that Metal Gear Solid V will be the greatest goddamn video game to ever be released. And hopefully, in time, people will feel the same way too."	t5_2s4hr	True

Compared to movies and books it still has a long way to go. That's precisely what I want to try to tackle with Ground Zeroes.**Honestly I'm going to be targeting a lot of taboos, a lot of mature themes that really are quite risky.** I'm not even sure if I'm going to be able to release the game, and even if I did release the game then maybe it wouldn't sell because it's too much. As a creator I want to take that risk. I'm approaching the project as a creator and prioritizing creativity over sales.""

Once again, when the conference is over I will put Youtube links in the OP for those that couldn't watch it or are coming in late. 

If you wouldn't mind upvoting this for visibility so nobody misses out, that would be great. Thanks!

**Details from the E3 pre-show(to be filled during/after):**

* Game takes place in 1984

* Snake is 49 years old.

* Race and Revenge are the two themes for this game

* Kiefer Sutherland voices Snake. Hayter was not mentioned at all.

* Huge emphasis on facial features and ""feeling"" what the characters are going through.

* ""Tension-packed experience""

...that's about it. Will watch again to see if I missed anything, but I'm a little shocked right now. 

**Final thoughts**

All of the stuff leading up to this - the tweets showing them working on a trailer, the graphics changes, the talk of demoing the open world - none of that was shown today. This means we'll be getting something on Monday, either at Microsoft's conference or Sony's. At least the wait isn't TOO long this time.

Being young and dumb I played through that game, skipping all the cut scenes and codec chats and simply playing for the experience. Even then I found the whole game amazing, the glimpses of story I saw blew my mind.

Fastforward 6 years later i'm on a crappy late shift at work. While on my break I see the MGS HD collection on sale for a great price. I thought, ""Oh it has that game I raved over as a kid, it'd be interesting to to play through it again"".

When I tell the assistant manager of my purchase he is in shock that I haven't even touched the first game. The next day he comes in with the original PS version of MGS. 

I've finally finished it and my word i've been blown away. The story, characters and twists made one hell of a game despite various technical issues. 

If i wasn't working tomorrow i'd be playing MGS2 again but that must wait for another day.

I know you lot probably don't care but I feel so pumped after playing MGS that I needed to speak to someone (and i'm sure the rents wouldn't appreciate being woken up at 1:17am).

TL;DR- Finally got round to playing MGS after only playing MGS2.

2. Kiefer Sutherland and David Hayter  will play Snake, either in a DBZ Fusion like voice or switching off whenever someone needs to take a nap. Then there's going to be two Snakes after the coma, with both actors playing both roles but it won't matter because they will both actually be Decoy Octopus

3. Eli is Liquid Snake, or so it would seems until its revealed that its actually Decoy Octopus just tucking his legs in

Les Enfants Teribles are the Id, Ego, and Super Ego of Big Boss.

Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, and Solidus Snake all rail against the Patriots.  But in their own way.

Liquid represents the Id. Our instinctual drive.  He is aggressive, almost to the point of being obsessive, in destroying the Patriots.  He also wants to be in control, and not have anyone ruling over him.  

Solidus is the Ego.  The ego, according to Freud, acts in a realistic way to please the ID. It uses conscious rationalization to please it's unconscious desires.  We know Solidus worked for the Patriots at one point. But when he wasn't able to gain entry into their inner circle, he rebeled and tried to destroy them.

Solid Snake, is the Super-Ego.  Quite simply, the Super-Ego is the conscience.  Our own critic.  Freud even states the the Super-Ego is the symbolic internalization of the father figure. The Super Ego and the Id are conflicting in nature.  The Id is about self satisfaction while the Super Ego is about living in a socially acceptable manner.

I'm not a psychologist or an expert on the Id, Ego and Super-Ego, but it just kind of stuck out to me today.  Anyone hear anything like this before? Anyone have any thoughts?"	t5_2s4hr	True

I've had some really thoughtful and interesting conversations as opposed to a lot of the butthurt for opinions i get from other subreddits in general. I'm just glad I have a place to release my MGS fanboy load. Cheers!	t5_2s4hr	True

When ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" started playing, i became a little overwhelmed. Seeing a place that reminded me of my teen years but now in a new, realistic setting was amazing.

I don't have a favorite game, I don't even have a favorite character. I look at the series as a whole as a big puzzle, who's final vision is not complete without every piece being in place.

However, upon reminiscing about MGS3... there is something incredibly magical about the game. I listen to the music, and I think about the extensive codec conversations and the nights and nights that I would stay up so early playing it. Actually feeling like I was in the wilderness, behind enemy lines.

The story, so beautifully written not only captures the essence of a classic MGS game, but it also maintains a certain characteristic I can't put my finger on... and on top of that, it seems to be the last game of the classic MGS format (above fixed camera, codec calls etc.)

There is just something about this game. I hold true that I don't have a favorite MGS, and that they all have their amazing parts and reasons why I always go back to them., but please tell me I'm not alone when I feel like there is something special about MGS3."	t5_2s4hr	True

Lently	69	8	14	"To elaborate, I would post as much lesser known info/trivia concerning one character in the MGS franchise as I know and can gather, and you could post info that you know, and together we can build a portfolio of this character.

The characters would primarily not be main protagonists or antagonists as most of the info would probably already be known. Think people like Sunny, Strangelove , etc.

Thoughts?

1370976855.0	1g51e3	I get why they chose Sutherland now.	kcamrn	79	19	37	"At the end of the trailer, hearing Snake say ""Kaz...I'm already a demon."" gave me chills. There was so much character depth in that single line that was conveyed though Sutherland's voice, and I found myself thinking about how difficult it is to convey human emotions through just our voices.

I hope they get away from is making Snake the typical clueless tool. I liked MGS 3 because there wasn't nearly as many times where Snake just repeats everything everyone says with a question mark at the end. I've always liked the character development in Big Boss, and I'm really hoping to see it progress and truly show us the emotions and character of Snake that we haven't seen before. 

Sutherland is going to make a great Snake, and I've decided that I'm done worrying about conspiracies. At this point I would actually be disappointed if Hayter were to come back as Big Boss. I see Hayter as Solid Snake now, and I hope to hear him after the credits roll. But for now, I can't wait to see Sutherland's performance.

Welcome to the family, Sutherland."	t5_2s4hr	True

As most of you know Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body.

Now if we take Metal Gear Solid i.e. The Body and take away David Hayter i.e. The Limb. Then technically everyone that wants David back is experiencing a Phantom pain.

1373378433.0	1hxnid	Was MGS4 trying to be the ultimate MGS game? I've run into sensory overload. *extremely late to the MGS4 party*	ihadaface	67	11	95	"This game is amazing, but god damn there's a lot of stuff. The level of detail is mind numbing, the pause screen has Sunny doing something different each time, mission briefings have all this info going across the screen, and the Mk.II lets you see the cutscene at a bazillion different angles in real time. I honesty don't know what to focus on. 

This game does feel fun, and very complete, but sometimes it just makes me kinda chuckle at how hard its trying (and it *should* try hard). MGS through MGS3 felt kinda simple compared to MGS4. It feels like a jump from 100% to 1000%. I guess it's because I've been waiting 5 years to play this game, and now I finally can, and my level of being impressed is so high that it feels kinda goofy in a way. I've had this false image of what playing MGS4 is like in my head, and now that I'm actually playing it, it's still amazing, but just totally different from what I'd been imagining.

Whatever MGS4 was trying to accomplish, it certainly did. Kojima went balls to the wall with this one. "	t5_2s4hr	True

Well, I feel like these are a few some people have still missed/don't talk about as much that I think need mention once in a while/still hidden in the game. For your enjoyment. 

-Call Para-Medic enough times and eventually Para-Medic will start wondering why Ocelot, a Soviet Soldier, has a code name of an animal from the Americas. Hinting at this American background. 

-Again, call Para-Medic enough times and she will eventually start talking about how she would personally like to clone Naked Snake, how his genes will be valuable for the future and how Snake would be the perfect test subject. Para-Medics real name is Dr. Clark, I.E the Woman/Doctor who started the process to clone Snake. http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3_radio_conversations#Cloning Heres the transcript. Thank you Jeremy_Sunshine

-All Cobra unit members blew up after you kill them. The Boss didn't. I'll let you think about that one for a while. [Just FYI on this one. We all know she's dead. And there are a few good reasons why she didn't implode. I just think its still an interesting thing to ponder about]

-Kuwabara Kuwabara, the phrase Volgin constantly says: Its an old Japanese phrase. Basically if you say it during when it rains or a thunderstorm, you won't get hit by lightning; it wards off spirits, such as The Sorrow. When Volgin died, The Sorrow (again, a spirit) was present and Volgin avoided the phrase. 

-Ever wonder what happened to the real Eva? Make your way to the Granin Research facility. You'll find yourself in the area where you fight The Fear but keep in mind this is at night and the very first time you enter the area. There will be a dead scientist hanging near the entrance to the Granin zone. The scientist was trying to escape but fell for a trap, no other scientist body was found. Most likely, this man was actually the real Eva trying to make his way to meet Snake before he was left hanging. [I know some people pointed out flaws with this one but I still stand that it was Eva. He must exist for at some point Snake was supposed to meet him as he was mentioned by zero. It can't be Adam because Ocelot=Adam].

-When fighting The Fear take a fake death pill. After The Fear examines you he will turn his back. Revive and throw a stun grenade. As he is stunned start shooting with a LETHAL weapon (like a machine gun). The Fear will die from STAMINA depletion. Any damage he takes while stunned takes away his stamina bar not his health bar. 

-If you have a Russian Glowcap equipped and call Para-Medic she will tell you (as a joke) that if  you eat one it'll recharge your batteries. Eat one while your batteries are low. Call Para-Medic again. Snake will tell Para-Medic she was right his batteries were recharged. Para-Medic will then talk to Sigint behind Snakes back, asking Sigint if Snake has gone insane. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COdkHuogVkw

-Snake doesn't like Sonic because Hedgehogs are the natural hunters of Snakes. 

-Editted for some errors. "	t5_2s4hr	True

1371493011.0	1gj38k	The new CSS is here!	FreshPaprikazzz	64	4	66	"**It's done!**
  
The new stylesheet is finally done. Welcome to the redesigned Motherbase! You have no idea how stressed I was to make everything look as good as possible once I realized that almost everyone wanted this stylesheet to be used in this sub.  
  
My main influence for this css came from MGS3 title screen and MGS4 database app. I wanted to things to look a bit mysterious and dark since the series itself gives me these kind of vibes at times. I'm a big fan of Yoji Shinkawa and since his artwork is so iconical, I decided to use his work for the header, sidebar and various other places (except that little guy hanging around at the bottom :-D).
If you don't happen to like it *at all*, remember that I can't please everyone. I'm sure you'll get used to it after some time. If it turns out that everyone hates the new look, we can always go back to the old one.    
   
**Internet Explorer**   
   
Reddit doesn't like IE. In matter of fact - no one likes IE. If you're using it there will be some visual bugs here and there with this css, so please: if you are using IE consider changing your browser to either Chrome or Firefox. You wont regret it.   
  
Also, I'm not sure about Safari. If you are using Safari and you see something's off with the stylesheet, take a screenshot of it and PM me or drop a comment to this thread.
   
**Flairs**   
   
I have unabled flairs for now. I was too lazy to make them work with this css. However, I liked the flairs we had before so I might bring them back sooner or later. But for now they're gone.   
   
**Suggestions?**   
   
Since there's over 10k of us now, I really do want everyone to enjoy their stay here with the new css. If you have any suggestions that are relatively easy to make happen, drop a comment here. If you want, you can upvote those suggestions that you think are kewl or important.   
  
This css has **alot** of changes compared to the initial reddit css. There might be some bugs I haven't noticed yet. If you happen to find any weird and awkard looking spots be sure to let me know! Now that I have permission to edit some stuff around here, I can fix stuff much faster without waiting for mods to take care of the code. Everything should work perfectly with Firefox, Chrome and Opera especially if you're using up-to-date versions.  
  
**Update:** I made the text in the black bar a bit smaller. Also - RES doesn't like the new skin at all. I'll try to tidy things up a bit more tomorrow."	t5_2s4hr	True

BossLackey	64	5	67	"Every time I play Snake Eater, I go to the Groznyj Grad South East (I think) for the second time when you're supposed to be planting C3 on the fuel tanks. There are 4 or 5 soldiers running drills and one guy making them do all of this. I lay down not far away, shoot the CO in the back with the Mk22 and wait for him to fall asleep. After he does, every one of the soldiers says ""Are you okay?"" all in a row and walk over to him. This last time I tranqed all of them but one. I started tranqing the only conscious guard so that he fell asleep right after waking someone up, thus, only one was left still. I did this for about 25 minutes, tranqed the last guy for good, crawled over to them, took out my knife, and stabbed them all in the face until they died (took a long time).

&gt;Pain had not been completely eliminated, but the intensity had been reduced by over 50% and the burning component had completely vanished (Bittar et al., 2005). 

This actually references a real document: [Revertant mosaicism and retrotransposons: Another explanation of “natural gene therapy” by Mario Bittar, Rudolf Happle Article 29 JUL 2005](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.a.30707/abstract)

1375678503.0	1jq0wl	How I would have re-written the B&amp;B Unit.	flashmedallion	67	13	43	"One of the more universally noted low-points of MGS4 was the B&amp;B Unit.  While I think there were some interesting elements to the how and why they were featured in the game, I think most people can agree that relative to the amount of time spent on each one, there was not a lot of meaningful pay-off to the characters either individually or as a whole.

To summarise what I think *did* work about them:

 - The general metaphor for what they represented was sound.  It's the logical conclusion of everything the series has said about what war does to people, and having innocent women utterly traumatised by events that really had nothing to do with them, and then exploited into perpetuating those crimes, was a good idea.  It just wasn't really built on.

 - Their mechanical/ludic construction, as mutations and recombinations of other bosses in the series also works, and I think is the best part about them.  They carry the weapons of MGS2 bosses, share the codenames of the MGS1 and MGS3 bosses, and the arenas you fight them in, as well as their respective styles of combat, also hearken back to previous bosses in various combinations.  As an example, Laughing Octopus takes her codename from Decoy Octopus, her ""emotion"" from The Joy, and her weapons from Solidus (P90 and Tentacles).  She also impersonates Snake earlier on, which recalls Solidus as well.  Her battle itself is most evocative of the fight with Grey Fox in MGS1 - taking place in a research lab, primary focusing on jump-out attacks, and hiding with stealth.

 - They also share many parallels with Old Snake.  Traumatised by war, and characterized as beasts.  They are unable to live outside their ""shell"", which is designed explicitly for warfare.  This parallels Snake's muscle suit in a literal sense, but also his psyche to an extent (Snakes Psyche being a fundamental element of the game).  I think this is both the strongest and most unfortunately underplayed elements of the characters, and with some minor revision would make them so much stronger and resonant in the overall scheme of things.

---

So what am I wanting to change?

In a nutshell, I would make each B&amp;B far more personally connected to Snake, through their respective trauma.  It's mentioned that they have been conditioned to hate Snake and hunt him down - making that connection more personal, extending that to encompass their trauma (which as it is written has no connection to anything), and using it to reflect Snakes journey as we progress through the game.

As I see it, the four emotions we encounter can and do relate to some of the primary elements of the effects of MGS on Snake.  

Octopus up first needs relatively little rewriting.  Her ""laughing"" is a response to the absurdity of war.  The pure random stupidity of it all.  There are lighter notes in MGS ranging from quirky humour, to darkly comic banter, to slapstick humour.  Humour is a natural response to stress and Snake has embraced that a little.  Now, I'm not saying Octopus should have been cracking jokes, just that she should have specifically addressed some of the existential absurdity of the horror in Snakes past.  Snake as a character doesn't really address this stuff directly, and he shouldn't.  That's not what he does.  But we could get a better glimpse of his pain through his reflection in Octopus.

Raven up next is perfectly placed in terms of the plot development.  We encounter and fight her right after a rather big info-dump for Snake.  Snake has just learned, from his mother that he just met, about the incredible level of machination and manipulation that has gone into shaping the world he lives in the events of his life.  He has just literally come face to face with the unvarnished reality that his pain, trauma and struggles are the result of a someone else's personal grudges.  After that, his mother figure is gravely injured.  Again, Snake doesn't need to be flying into a rage about the whole situation - that's not his character - but a Raven who has been through something similar, a backstory where she was made to suffer all through the political machinations of people she's never met, for their own profit, could be consumed with an impotent rage about her helplessness.  Again, we would be able to see that facet of Snakes psyche through the reflection in Raven.

I'm sure you see where I'm going with this, and just how little needs to be changed to actually make the idea work.  

Wolf's trauma should come from the sorrow of never being able to return to her golden years.  Just about any kind of backstory would work here, maybe where at a young age she left her home to train to fight to protect it, only to return to discover that while she was gone, her home was destroyed by whatever conflict.  That haunting sorrow of nostalgia discoloured by regret and loss is heavy in the Shadow Moses sequence, but again Snake doesn't express it directly.  This should be echoed through Wolfs trauma.

Mantis should express the utter incomprehension of it all.  The insanity that is induced by layers and layers of conspiracy, the blurring the lines between reality and fiction, the technology so advanced that it's indistinguishable from magic.  The facts that A) Mantis recalls Psycho Mantis and B) The Haven Chapter specifically channels MSG2 (the tanker design at the start, and the octagonal arena in the bowels of the ship that recalls Arsenal) feed into this personally, along with the nanomachines, which must be directly overcome to defeat Mantis (the only time you are forced to use the Syringe) would position Mantis to reflect the pure insanity of what Snake has been through.

So yeah, that's my pitch.  In terms of how it would play out, the formula doesn't really need to change.  Instead of yammering on about THE RAGE! SHOW ME YOUR RAGE! the beasts should be taunting Snake about the specifics of his trauma (they've been taught everything about him, remember).  

&gt;""*SNAAAAAKKKEE! You're a TOOL.  A WEAPON, created for politicians to wield for PROFIT.  You have no say in ANYTHING!!.  EVERYTHING you've fought for has been a proxy battle in someone else's GRUDGE MATCH!!* **Doesn't it PISS you OFF? SUFFERING for someone else's WAR!?**  *I was a disposable WEAPON in wars made possible by YOU*, **AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!**  **RAAAAAAAAAGGGGEEE**etc.""

^(Please excuse my atrocious Metal Gear dialogue)

Once the Beauty comes out she's in awe of how Snake has overcome his trauma, he hasn't let it get in the way of his life.  Short speech describing that.  She realises that there's a better way, and rage begets rage blah-blah-blah.  So in this version, it actually makes Sense when Drebin tells Snake that he's freed the beauties, because they actually get some psychological peace before they die at Snake's hands.  And they get that from Snake the character as an extension of the player, because the player has overcome the taunting and the reality of Snakes history and won the battle none-the-less.  Drebin can still give a little backstory and the player can then realize where each beast was actually coming from - they've experienced the same trauma as Snake, but they weren't strong enough to overcome it.

The Raven speech should genuinely piss you off - you should feel ashamed for playing MGS, to the point where you are going to prove her wrong by destroying her.  The patience-based battle will force you to get over it.  The Octopus speech should genuinely leave you apathetically amused.  Wolf should having you tearing up with nostalgia and loss by the time the battle starts.  Mantis should be pointing out plot-holes to the point where you aren't even interesting in finding out how MGS4 ends.

**[TL;DR](http://pspmedia.ign.com/psp/image/article/683/683681/metal-gear-solid-digital-comic-working-title-20060125115218797.jpg)** - Snake, as a character who has overcome his incomparable trauma, should be demonstrating that mechanically by overcoming his darker reflections - people who succumbed to their specific trauma - at the hands of the player.

And all we have to do is re-write a little dialogue, and leave the structure intact."	t5_2s4hr	True

1355178338.0	14mncl	An Alternative theory to MGS5	st0567	66	11	55	"There's really only been talk about this being Big Boss in the Phantom Pain, but here's my alternative theory (and how it is important to the overall series):

We are supposed to believe this character is Big Boss, I mean this character only sees things that Big Boss would have seen, but not only are we supposed to believe this is Big Boss, but this Character is as well. He is a clone of Big Boss. The fifth (V) snake.

Solid and Liquid came in pairs, and now, Solidus' partner is being revealed. Solid and liquid were the Dominant and Recessive, the genetically manipulated (nature) clones, while Solidus and V are environmentally manipulated (nurture) attempts to make The Ultimate Soldier and the Ultimate Leader, respectively.

From [Solidus](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solidus_Snake) on the wiki:
&gt;The creation of the original clones led to Big Boss's departure from the Patriots. Thus, the organization required a perfect clone in order to retain a figurehead for their organization in the image of Big Boss.

However, V, not Solidus, was supposed to be this figure head. Solidus was an attempt to hone a perfect clone as the ultimate soldier version of Big Boss (as it was unknown how well the dominant or recessive clone would do at this point). He was sent to fight at a young age (as a teenager according to the wiki) in the Liberian Civil War. V was supposed to be the new figurehead; in fact he would be the most ""manipulated"" of any of the clones.

V needed all the experiences of Big Boss in order to truly lead like him, he needs his memories. How can this be done? Enter a young Psycho Mantis. He is realistically the only character still alive that we know of who could truly put memories into someone. V is kept in a coma until his body reaches the age of Big Boss post snake eater. (""You've been in a coma for quite some time"") He now has all the memories of Big Boss sometimes haunting him, but never being extremely clear or vivid. He is the truest clone. Including memories.

This theory then branches out into two different options (I think b is more likely, and much better):

A: Big Boss finds out about V, and dies at some point. The clone replaces him, but the memories aren't as solid and he becomes much less stable. He replaces Big Boss, which is why ""Big Boss"" becomes evil.

B: Big Boss finds out about V. He was already angry about Solid and Liquid, but this is going too far. To haunt someone with his memories, and to attempt to mentally copy and manipulate someone is evil. Big Boss realizes the Patriots are the greatest evil. He will go to any length to stop them, which is how he becomes perceived as evil. He also kills V in the process. This theory also leads to some nice parallels with the boss. Some scenes in the trailer could be a combination of Big Boss's anti-V team and hallucinations, giving the illusion/reality that Big Boss leads a supernatural squad, like the boss. He also becomes perceived as evil similar to the boss.

The death of V leads to the failure of ""The Figure Head"" clone, and Solidus has to come back to be the figurehead (the most important role for the patriots and zero) which he failed as, since he wasn't designed to do that.

This also makes the name *The Phantom Pain* very relevant. 

From [Wikipedia]:

&gt;Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body.

The ""Phantom Pain"" being experienced is the brain. Big Boss's brain. The clone is experiencing mostly the painful memories from the organ he does not have."	t5_2s4hr	True

This is not a good recommendation in the sense that it dilutes and morphs what the author is trying to say. The story is written in a specific order and meant to be experienced that way. By changing the order you are ensuring that a lot of things maybe won't connect properly, and that the references do not make sense or they may make you confused. I cannot stress this enough. Imagine if you watched NEW Star Wars instead of the old Star Wars first. You would be robbed of the subtle reveal of Yoda, where it turns out he is little green thingy yet the jedi master. If you saw new Star Wars first he would just be some sort of guy on the council that seems self important. You will ruin the experience if you do not go in order of release. Playing MGS 3 before 2 completely changes the dynamic of playing MGS 2 for example.

If you want to experience the story in chronological fiction order on purpose or on a 2nd playthrough or something, that's totally fine. You are free to enjoy your games how you wish to. But do not tell new players that playing through the fiction's chronology is the ""right"" path. You have the author's vision and then you have your own take, it's logical for the creator to take precedent over your opinion in this situation.

**tldr:** you're lazy, this isn't even a long post.

1358739326.0	16yuzx	Announcement regarding the subreddit merger proposal. 	Killerzeit	69	16	20	"Hello, everyone! As most of you probably know by now, last week user Cee-Jay proposed a merge between r/metalgearsolid and r/metalgear.

I will say this up-front, since I feel this is the most important bit:

**I have decided to NOT go through with a merger at this time.**

Please let me explain, as I have a few reasons for this.

1) I saw an argument for r/metalgear being a better name for the subreddit as it would encompass not only the Metal Gear Solid works, but Metal Gear projects as well. I cannot say entirely that I agree with this, as the name of the subreddit has never affected whether or not those games were discussed and/or posted about in this subreddit. That would be like someone telling me that I should merge my own subreddit, r/cheeseburgers, with r/hamburgers, because r/cheeseburgers doesn't do justice to hamburgers, which simply isn't true.

2) I also saw some argument that r/metalgear would be easier to find. Again, I cannot say I agree for the reason that r/metalgear was actually created *12* days before I created r/metalgearsolid. There are currently 5,717 of you subscribed here, and shy of 1,000 subscribed over there. 3,000+ subscribers have joined within the last six months. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say that because there were active users, and I was an active moderator, adding CSS and flair and other luxuries, that people decided to subscribe. I can't say that I think telling everyone from r/metalgearsolid to move to r/metalgear seems wise, easy, or even convenient. What I would see happening is that I'd tell everyone to go over there, and then the subreddits would end up evening out and being divided half and half, which is not what I want. I feel that common sense would dictate that what few active users are over there should come join our family over here. The more the merrier!

3) I would be losing something I like doing. As the subreddit exists now, there does not need to be any more moderators. I'm not saying I don't think we wouldn't need more in the future, but the community here is very sensible, friendly, and coherent, which I am very proud of. There are posts that get stuck in the spam filter for absolutely no reason, sure, but there are hardly reports for any harsh comments or spam posts because they simple just don't exist over here. For that, I'm a really lucky moderator, as I've only heard the kinds of horror stories from other moderators of persistent users and spammers. Perhaps, in the future, if this subreddit continues to grow by the thousands, I will seriously consider appointing other moderators. Trust me when I say that there is really no work to be done here. Having too many people trying to moderate little to no activity is just asking for problems.

So... I like what I have nurtured and created. Basically handing that away to other moderators is not what is ideal right now. I have seen too many subreddits go downhill after adding too many moderators and trying to fix so many things that were not even wrong in the first place, which is why you will NEVER, EVER see me posting things like, ""Hey, r/metalgearsolid, we need to talk..."" or ""Hey! r/metalgearsolid, a word with you?"" because I think it's stupid.

I live by the philosophy that if there is nothing wrong, nothing needs to be 'fixed,' or in the case, merged.

I hope that you can understand why I don't want to go through with the merger and respect my decision as a moderator, just as I respect you as users, since throughout 99% of Reddit, I'm just a user, too. I try to not do things that I see that I don't like, and just go from there - taking your ideas and suggestions and making this place into what it is.

Anyway, please upvote this so more people can see it! I receive no karma. I will also be adding an announcement bar at the top.

As far as the others go, I thought the first two games were fun, but were also too punishing to new players because of you having almost no way to defend yourself. The newer games also had their issues; Guns of the Patriots wasn't bad, but Peace Walker quite frankly disappointed me with how simple and gimmicky it was for a large part of the game.

1371582121.0	1gloyd	MGSV Theory: Kaz is Ahab, Big Boss is Ishmael	st0567	58	7	34	"We already know Metal Gear Solid V will be influenced by Moby Dick, however, many have already assumed that Big Boss is Ahab. This theory will provide some evidence why Big Boss is actually Ishmael, and Kaz is Ahab.

Evidence supporting this theory:

* The bandaged man says call me Ishmael. The bandaged man is also voiced by Sutherland. Many have already speculated the Bandaged Man is part of Big Bosses Psyche, and if true, this would imply Big Boss is Ishmael.

* Ahab loses his leg to the whale. Big Boss doesn't lose his leg, but Kaz does.

* Ahab has his leg replaced by a prosthetic; Kaz does as well.

* ""From Fox two phantoms were born"" - Ishmael is the biblical son of Abraham, and Isaac was also the son of Abraham, these two both are important to two separate religions, two different ideologies. Ishmaels mother was also cast out, similar to how the Boss was abandoned by her country.

* Ishmael is the main character in Moby Dick, Snake is the main character in MG.

* Kaz talks about revenge being their goal. Ahab's motivation is revenge.

This last point could apply to either big boss or Kaz, but the speculation is about it's application to Kaz:

* More Biblical info: Biblical Ahab has 4 encounters with prophets, the first with **Eli**jah, the second with two unnamed prophets, the third with **Eli**jah again, and the fourth with Micaiah.

Some speculation about this point: 

This fourth one is interesting. Here's a quote about it from wikipedia:
&gt; The fourth encounter is with Micaiah, the prophet who, when asked for advice on a military campaign, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle

This quote could be interesting when viewed in context of Metal Gear Solid. We don't know who Micaiah is, but if we assume he is working with liquid, then essentially here someone is telling Miller how it is part of the plan where he is killed, and that plan in MGS1 is to take down the patriots. Miller would most likely agree with that, and he is being guaranteed success of the mission, he might be willing to die in MGS1. Ahab also dies while in disguise, which could be a hint at liquid being in disguise. We also know miller had dogs in his home, and when Ahab died, dogs were licking at his blood.

Well feel free to add to this theory, or disprove it, or speculate on it!

EDIT: A few interesting points as well, that I haven't been able to incorperate, or that other redditers brought up:

* Elijah is a charachter in Moby Dick. I haven't read the book yet (it's on my summer reading!), and haven't quite had the time to research him... and Eli can be short for elijah

* u/davidsomerset said 
&gt; There are also some interesting points to do with Ahab's interactions with another character called ['Captain Boomer'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick#Captain_Boomer). Boomer lost an arm to Moby Dick but has come to terms with his loss, advising Ahab against revenge.

This point could lead to some good speculation too."	t5_2s4hr	True

Quick Reference of best missions for each soldier type:
RnD: Extra Ops 49  
Mess Hall: Extra Ops 46  
Medical: Extra Ops 26  
Intel: Main Ops 08   


***MISSIONS***  

**[Main Ops] 05 - Rescue Chico** (1 S-Rank Intel troop)  
&gt;In Camino de Lava: Junction, Miller tells you to watch out for snipers. The sniper is our target, he's the S-rank soldier, tranq the two mooks at ground level, then sneak around the left-hand side and place a Fulton Mine under the sniper and shoot it, or if you have the Carl Gustav (Fulton Recovery), you may as well just take him like that. Those are your only two options for recovering this soldier.  

**[MO] 08 - Destroy the Barricade** (2 S-Rank Intel troops)  

&gt;In this one, make your way back to Camino de Lava: Junction, there are two snipers in the same area as the sniper from Main Ops 05. One in front of you and to the right and behind. Use the Carl Gustav (Fulton Recovery) on them, or place Fulton Mines at the base of the cliff directly underneath each sniper, then shoot the mine to trigger it. After this, complete the mission normally.  


**[Extra Ops] 26 - Eliminate Enemy Soldiers** (1 S-Rank Medical P.O.W.)  

&gt;Make your way to the other end of the map. After going down the narrow alley with a sniper at the other end, the prisoner should be against the wall to your left between two pillars. Fulton recovery her, then finish the mission. The soldiers you have to eliminate are nothing special, not worth recruiting.  


**[EO] 46 - Perfect Stealth** (1 S-Rank Mess Hall, 1 A-Rank RnD, 1 A-Rank Mess Hall soldier, numerous B-Ranking soldiers of various units)
  
&gt;In the first map, the second soldier you come across has an S-Rank in Cooking skill.
In the next area, Camino de Lava: Junction, there's our old mate the Sniper, who incidentally is either an A- or S-Ranked Intel trooper. Remove the regular mooks on the ground from the equation, then C.Gustav (FR) or Fulton Mine him.

&gt;Instead of going to the objective, head to Cafetal Aroma Encatado: Entrance. The first two soldiers are nothing special, put them down. The third guy, who patrols behind the truck up the hill, is an A-Rank RnD trooper. The soldier patrolling the unreachable catwalk a little further on is a B-Rank Mess Hall trooper, if you want that. You'll need to Fulton Gustav or Fulton Mine him though. The next soldier along, near the end of the map, is an A-Rank Medical Unit trooper, again you'll need to Gustav or Fulton Mine him as you can't reach him to place a Fulton balloon in person. There's nothing special inside the Mill, so you can backtrack to the target.  

&gt;In Los Cantos: Canyon, the furthest soldier from your entrance, on the bottom level, has an A-Rank in Medical. There's nothing special in Los Cantos: Ridge, but in Fuerte La Ladera, the soldier on the right on top of the battlements has an A-Rank in Mess hall.  

**[EO] 47 - Perfect Stealth** (1 A-Rank Intel, numerous B-Ranking Intel soldiers)  

&gt;There are many B-Ranking Intel soldiers in this mission, almost every second soldier. However, the lone A-Rank Intel soldier we want is at Selvade la Muerte: Bottom of Cliff. There are two Ghillie-suited snipers hiding at the far end of the map: the one on the right (from where you start) is a D-Rank, but the other one who is slighlty closer but on the far left side, has the A-Rank in Intel.

&gt;In Ruinas de Xochiquetzal, the first soldier you encounter on the right has a B-Rank in RnD. Further along, the soldier directly in the middle of the courtyard has a B-Rank in Combat, and the soldier directly behind him has a B-Rank in Medical. Up to you whether you want to recruit them or not.  

**[EO] 48 - Perfect Stealth** (1 A-Rank RnD, 1 A-Rank Combat Unit soldier, some B-Ranking soldiers of various units)  
&gt;In the second map, Small Maintenance Dock, the first soldier on the right as you enter is an A-Rank RnD soldier.  

&gt;In the next area, Rooftop, the first soldier you encounter is an A-Rank Combat Unit soldier. This mission is fairly short if you don't screw it up, so it's possible to farm A-Rank Combat solders from it.


**[EO] 49 - Perfect Stealth** (2 A-Rank RnD, 1 B-Rank Medical soldier)  

&gt;As you start, there is a walkway that goes across you from left to right, about 30 metres in front of you. there is a P.O.W. (A-Rank RnD) in a nook on the catwalk.
In the next area, Underground Passage A, near the end of this map there is a P.O.W. (A-Rank RnD) being guarded by two soldiers (Both B-Rank Combat). Recover them all if you need some Combat Unit soldiers, then head into the next area.  

&gt;In this area, Underground Passage B, there is a P.O.W. (B-Rank Medical). Recover her, then finish the mission. The RnD P.O.W.'s almost always morale-up into S-Ranks, and they often have awesome skills like Metamaterials Technology, Anti-Tank Rifle Design, etc. This is the mission you want to farm for RnD recruits.


**[EO] 50 - Perfect Stealth** (1 S-Rank Medical, 1 A-Rank RnD, various B-Rank soldiers)  

&gt;There are quite a few B-Rank soldiers in this mission that scrub up very nicely into A- and S-Ranked soldiers, but for brevity's sake I'll focus on the higher ranked soldiers.
Once you've made your way to El Cenagal: Ravine, and are at the bridge, you should notice two soldiers on it. The soldier on the left has an S-Rank in Medical, as well as some Med Unit skills.  

&gt;All the way in the last map, Bananal Fruta de Oro: Sorting Shed, there is a soldier inside the shed who patrols the back wall. He has an A-Rank in RnD, and some useful skills occasionally.

**[EO] 55 - U.S. Soldier Retrieval** (1 A-Rank RnD soldier)  

&gt;The A-Rank soldier in this mission is the target P.O.W., just recover him and complete the mission.


**[EO] 75 - Armoured Vehicle Battle: LAV-Type C Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units, most common Combat Unit)  

&gt;There's no hard and fast rule for A-Rankers here, but the first four soldiers that accompany the LAV are A-Ranked. Just try to recruit as many as you can.

**[EO] 79 - Tank Battle: T-72 A Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units, most common Combat Unit)  

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.


**[EO] 83 - Tank Battle: MBTk-70 Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units, most common Combat Unit)  

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.

**[EO] 98 - Tank Battle: MBTk-70 Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units, most common Combat Unit)  

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.


**[EO] 100 - Armoured Vehicle Battle: BTR-60 PA Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units, most common Combat Unit)  

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.
  
As a general rule of thumb, if the vehicle Op has five RED skulls, chances are the vehicle escorts are going to have some good skills. Many high-level Combat, Intel and Medical soldiers can be found in these missions. The best thing to do is find a mission you're comfortable with and farm recruits from it.


***DETAILS***


You can check the number of soldiers with certain ranks by hovering over a mission and pressing Triangle. Sometimes, the ranks can have a ? next to them
(eg. S:?? A:?? B:04 C:08 D:00 E:00). If your Intel Team is high enough, these ?'s will be removed (the level for removing the ?'s over S Ranks is Intel Level 99).


Some of these missions require you to make it to the goal without being spotted or killing a single enemy. But there's no time limit, and in Extra Op 46 especially there's some really good soldiers just waiting to be recruited.
In the first area alone, there is an S-ranked Chef, the second soldier you encounter. If you go into every area, use your Analyser, knock out and fulton every soldier who's any good, you'll soon find your Combat, R&amp;D, Mess Hall and Medical Teams growing quickly.
The trick is, don't take any soldier under B rank - that is, take only S, A, and B-ranked soldiers. This saves your Fultons for later soldiers who are more powerful, and prevents your base from being clogged up with essentially useless soldiers.


Of course, an Analyser is a must-have tool for... well, analysing soldiers. It's worth the time and Gross Military Profit (GMP) to develop this item to its 5th and final rank. The fifth rank will show all relevant stats of a soldier, as well as what items they have in their inventory. It will scan almost immediately.

*Note that even if you have a full Mother Base, you can still perform Fulton Recoveries on soldiers. Kazuhira will object, saying things like 'Mother Base is jam-packed. until some of these people leave...."" etc. However, you can keep recruiting. If you have more than 350 soldiers at the end of the mission, you will be taken to a screen and asked to dismiss excess soldiers. So don't worry about seeing an A- or S-ranked soldier and having no more room, just recover him anyway.
