NO SPOILERS	starguy13	222	37	134	"I have been reading some of the negative reviews of Man of Steel and it makes me sad that so many people only see superman as the big blue boy scout from the 1950's. ""Superman is a godlike being from another galaxy, created to inhabit the infantile fantasy lives of young children. Any attempt to invest him with philosophical depth risks becoming moronic and/or offensive almost immediately."" This... This right here kills me. This critic obviously doesn't understand that as a character superman CAN and on multiple occasions gets very philosophical. This one line from this one review shows me that these people are expecting a film just like the avengers, with witty banter and jokes thrown in with just pure action. I like the Avengers movie, but i am afraid that it has dumbed down the idea of what a super hero can do... it is moronic and offensive to not be able to look past the S and see that this is a story of a man who struggles with living in a world that he could break if he is not careful."	t5_2qlmm	True

I say this because he has but one power and thats his speed but yet he manipulates this power in such a wide spectrum that he could so to speak have oh so many more powers. not only is he a force to be reckoned with but also extremely smart and has the best outlook on everything, he is always joking around and in good spirit even in the most grim of situations. i find him to be the greatest hero to ever live does anyone else share my opinion or have an opinion about another hero that they wish to share?	t5_2qlmm	True

1339023376.0	uos08	I will no longer be visiting my local comic book store.	doublefang	122	23	45	"Today, while rummaging through this week's new selection and hate-buying the new Watchmen series, the owner of my local comic book store started talking to one of his customers about the ""gay issue"" of Earth Two. Obviously he was referring to the new take on Alan Scott and, I guess when all is said and done, Earth Two #2 will go down as an issue that deals with homosexuality, but that was the least of his offensive remarks. He went on to say that ""the big queer should go back in the closet where he belongs"" and went on a mini-rant for a minute or two.  The most troubling thing for me isn't that there are homophobes in the town that I live in (This is nothing new), but that it has shattered my belief that comic book stores are sort of safe, judgement free havens. I know it's sort of naive to think that way, but I just sort of feel beside myself now.

Needless to say he's lost a customer. Has anyone else experienced something like this?"	t5_2qlmm	True

The same scenario with the burning rig when all of a sudden an orange and green flash comes bursting from the water and there is Arthur Curry in all his kingly goodness, clad in brilliant scale mail, trident in hand. Too bad we will probably never see him given a serious chance on the big screen, could be magical.	t5_2qlmm	True
