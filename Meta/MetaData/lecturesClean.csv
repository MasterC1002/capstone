* [**Paul Bloom - Introduction to Psychology (Yale University)**](http://academicearth.org/courses/introduction-to-psychology)
I've listened to a lot of psychology lectures/podcasts available online, but I found these lectures by Paul Bloom by far the best. He gives a terrific introduction to psychology in 21 lectures and does so with a the perfect combination of humor (In an episode about social psychology he begins: *We are intensely interested in how other people work. The story that was a dominant news story in 2005 was this. And some of you--this--for those of you who aren't seeing the screen, is the separation of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt. I remember where I was when I first heard about this*) theoretical insight and empirical studies. 




* [**Radiolab**](http://www.radiolab.org)
This show is broad casted by WNYC and NPR and all shows are available as a podcast on their website. It's presented by two guys who are really fascinated by a wide variety of scientific subjects and clearly demonstrate this in their show. They always have the most amazing and important scientists in their show to answer their questions and, like Paul Bloom, know when to use (great) humor and when to be dead serious. The show has a very entertaining structure which makes you want to listen every minute of it; usually three stories are told from which the scientific jum-jum begins. 




* [**Robert Sapolsky - The Uniqueness of Humans**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrCVu25wQ5s)
This man is a genius (or ""renowned professor of neurology, neurological sciences, neurosurgery and biological sciences"", whatever you prefer). 
In this lecture he explains why we're not all that different from other animals. Interesting, funny, mind-blowing.




* I'm assuming you've all seen pretty much all the cool scientific TED-talks, but if you've just discovered the internet a few days ago or just woke up from a 10 year-wintersleep [**here**](http://www.ted.com) is the link.




* [**Matt Walker - Secrets of the Sleeping Brain**](http://fora.tv/2009/08/11/Matt_Walker_Secrets_of_the_Sleeping_Brain)
Really fascinating talk about sleep. Why do we sleep, why do we dream, how do we sleep, how do we dream. Etcetera. I think he can explain it much better than I can, so I'll just leave you with the link. 




* [**V.S. Ramachandran - Phantoms in the Brain (BBC 4)**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq6u4XVrr58)
Not exactly a podcast or lecture, but wanted to share this. This is my favorite neuroscientist. He's really good at explaining rather difficult scientific theories and concepts plus he pronounces the letter R as a pro. In this documentary (based on his book 'Phantoms in the Brain) he shows a few patients suffering from really rare neurological -and bizarre- disorders and explains why and how they occur. The book is also a must-read.

* [**Robert Sapolsky - Human Behavioral Biology**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&amp;feature=channel) I haven't watched this completely yet, but until now it's been really interesting. Check it! Yeaa

I'd really appreciate your recommendations as well!

Not a typical r/lecture post but I think it fits well. chalkSmart provides ~20 min long synopses of non-fiction books in the form of very pleasing (and informative) mind maps. Covered up to now:

Greg Craven: What's the Worst that Could Happen?

John Medina: Brain Rules

Joshua Foer: MoonWalking with Einstein

I find this extremely useful - I have a very long to-read list and this gives good overview where I want to invest my time (as it was with Foer's book). Maybe we can encourage him to continue with these efforts?

Misssion statement from his youtube blurb:

chalkSmart's primary goal is to make the knowledge contained within published non-fiction material more accessible. By isolating the core ideas and presenting them in a mildly entertaining and straightforward manner, more informed opinions are surely to follow."	t5_2qidy	True
