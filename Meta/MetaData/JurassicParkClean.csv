1359760834.0	17q2k0	So you wanna play The Lost World Jurassic Park arcade game, huh?	kidintheshadows	37	0	20	"Alright. Since I saw this post www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/17p65a/if_i_spot_this_game_at_an_arcade_i_have_to_play_it/ I figured I'd show you guys (those that don't already know) how you can play it on your PC!

FYI: I recommend having at least a Dual-Core processor, but obviously the better the process, the better the game will play.

**Step 1**: Download this: http://www.supermodel3.com/Download.html (Select the appropriate version).

**Step 2**: Extract the .zip contents somewhere (Desktop, Program Files, where ever you want).

**Step 3**: Download this: http://coolrom.com/roms/mame/9864/The_Lost_World.php (lostwsga.zip).

**Step 4**: DO NOT EXTRACT lostwsga.zip. Simply place it in the same directory as the Supermodel directory you extracted.

**Step 5**: Create a shortcut of the Supermodel.exe file, and place the following in the ""Target"" field of the shortcut properties:
    ""D:\Supermodel 0.2a x64\Supermodel.exe"" *lostwsga.zip -fullscreen -res=1024,768*
        

**NOTE** ""D:\Supermodel\Supermodel.exe"" is where I have my Supermodel directory. So you do not need to change this part. This will load the game automatically in fullscreen at the specified resolution (1024 X 768).

The game should load up and you can play! The ""1"" key is for ""Start Player 1"", the ""5"" key is for inserting coins, ""Left Mouse"" should be trigger and to reload it is ""Hold Right Mouse"" + ""Left Mouse"".


Have fun! And if you run into any issues, let me know and I'll try to respond.

The sound, the music, the color and clarity of the picture was astounding. There were a mere 6 other people there and I went with my brother and father. I just can't express in words how happy I am now that I have seen it on the big screen, and hell, this day is probably one of the most joyful and exciting days of my life.

1376349874.0	1k8osd	Jurassic Park of Decay: An idea for a Jurassic Game	Tr1xCadeyrn	30	6	4	"I see that alot of people post their ideas about a jurassic park game on here and thought to do the same. I was thinking of a mix of state of decay with dinosaurs set in a jungle island. In case you don't know about state of decay, read this first paragraph. If you do, skip it!

Recently released, State of Decay a zombie-survival game where you must scavenge and fend of zombie with your fellow survivors hold up somewhere. Your objectives are to protect, keep fed and survive the zombie outbreak until you find a way to escape. You can switch from character to character, all who have different abilities and sets of skills. You can use melee weapons or guns to kill zombies or use stealth to remain unseen. A fight with a zombie could attract more and end up getting your character killed. Either way, you must scavenge for resources in abandoned houses and manage the ones you already have. So now that I've given you a gameplay summary of State of Decay and I'll move into Jurassic Park of Decay and trust me It's right up your alley!

Imagine you are in group of survivors, maybe 12 people, stuck on one of the islands (maybe even site C). You all were left stranded in a old dilapidated building with enough resources to start out but won't last for long. In order to survive the characters in need to search the jungle or red wood forest (depending the island) in order to keep themselves alive. They'll need food, water, medicine, etc to stay alive. You and the group must go out and get the things you need. The reasoning for their situation is unclear but becomes more of a problem and causes fights between the survivors. It's up to you to make sure everything is going smoothly (or smoothly as can be) to keep everyone alive. The main problem with your current location is the proximity to the center of the island. Carnivorous dinos are lurking waiting to strike for their next snack. 

You must move quickly if you want to survive. The issue is the farther you move from the island's center, the less supplies are easily available. Ingen left many storage sheds and building for their personal, who at the time were safe. Also only few buildings even exist on the coastal areas so adequate living space is hard to find. It's a trade-off between two evils. Either live in constant danger of predators or the danger of starvation, lack of sleep, etc. Fear not. There would be many ways to keep your group alive. 

While scavenging for prepackaged food, take note that fruits and berries exist out in the wild. Be careful though. Without proper knowledge, you may be unwitting poisoned. Also game trails exist throughout the island, just not as anyone would know it. Dino meat is meat. How you get it is question? Quietly stalk your prey or go out in some of Ingen's loud and old roundup vehicles? Be careful though! Noise attracts predators and there is nothing stopping a T-rex from chomping on your vehicle. While a T-rex may be a little easier to avoid, more clever dinosaurs may follow you back home and discover your hold group, compromising safety. The jungle, which may have provided you the ability to be stealthy and move unnoticed, is not fickle and grants that ability to the dinosaurs. Raptors can come in full force or in a small recon mission, testing your defenses. If you see a small hole in your fences, RUN! Unless you have acquired some of Ingen's weaponry that is scattered throughout the island. Shotguns, pistols, hunting rifles, all at your disposal. Want something a little more humane? A tranq or two can be found along side many of the weapons. 

Either way be careful, Killing or taking down a dinosaur isn't easy. You may find outmaneuvering a simpler way of getting out of danger, but the dinosaurs are more clever than you think. A dinosaur you've shot but didn't kill may comeback for revenge. With all this danger, you must use your knowledge of the park and the animals to counter it. 

Someone in the group must be scientist or a hunter or someone native to island. Even a computer nerd can come in handy, seeing as Ingen interconnected the entire park with a vast array of computer. Use them to your advantage, whether it's getting maps and information on specific dinosaurs or unlocking doors and moving transport cars. Use their knowledge and skills to keep away from dino jaws.

 Speaking of Dinosaurs, Raptors and T-rex aren't the only thing listed on Ingen's Species list. Brachiosaurus, stegosaurus, triceratops, you name it! Look in awe as the island holds a complete ecological system. Maybe you want to take a photo? or video? Just bare that sightseeing may lead to a chase scene, so keep on your toes. Also, Ingen had a nasty habit of not mentioning all the dinosaurs and different prehistoric creature so be prepare for new, exciting and scary things. 

The point is survive long enough and maybe everyone makes it back home.

Supposedly, concrete moats and other physical security was in place to keep most animals from making it to the visitor's center, but clearly the T-rex made it there anyway in less than a day.

Placement of the raptor pen and the use of thin bars and cables for containment was a weird error given the level of respect they had for them before either incidents even occurred.

Additionally, when transporting the raptor from its holding box to the raptor pen, the use of a mechanical mating system and two gates seems pretty obvious. Even dog parks get this right.

The tell tale game was fine, but it wasn't the action packed adventure game the series had the potential to be. Here's my idea.

The destruction of Site B has always seemed a little fishy. They abandoned the entire island and gave up just because a severe storm came through? What if something else actually happened? What if Dodson's company raided the island with some kind of attack. What if they uncover something sinister below the surface, like Ingen performing genetic modifications on humans and dinosaurs. 

Make it a third person shooter, like Resident Evil. Make the mystery and suspense of the game part of the enjoyment. Not just a nonstop bullet frenzy.

1366143896.0	1chfsb	Nedry's decision making process	transmogrify	11	0	9	"The payoff to Nedry for his role in sabotaging Jurassic Park was [$750,000 up front, plus $50,000 per embryo for each of 15 species of dinosaur, for $1,500,000 total](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4MUBQNbTYo&amp;t=0m54s). Nedry literally dances with joy at this deal.

$1.5M seems kind of cheap for Biosyn, considering what they're buying: 15 goddamn *dinosaurs*, plus the inevitable ruin of their biggest competitor corporation. Was Nedry just the world's worst negotiator? Was he in deep with some bad people and needed the money fast? Was this way more money in 1993 than I'm thinking?

Nedry undertook a lot of risks in this deal. Some of those risks he probably strongly underestimated: The risk that he would find himself careening down a dirt road during a hurricane, the risk that a bunch of dinosaurs would eat nearly all his coworkers, the risk that he himself would die. I'm sure he either overlooked those possibilities entirely, or at least considered them acceptably unlikely.

But let's consider Plan A. If everything went right, then twenty minutes after Nedry bolts from his desk, Hammond figures out what he did. InGen comes after him for the theft of priceless proprietary technology, and Hammond's friends in the Costa Rican government get the local police after him. Maybe his twenty minute head start is enough confusion for Biosyn to pick him up from the mainland in a helicopter, if he thought to set that up ahead of time. And now Dennis Nedry spends the rest of his life in a non-extraditing country of some variety, living off of however much pie $1.5 million can buy in 1993.

Plan B is a lot of jail time. How much, I couldn't guess. If he's lucky, he can do that jail time in the US and not Central America.

At least Dodgson bought him lunch."	t5_2sdsw	True

So many people are throwing around the word ""Reboot"". What evidence have we received indicated that this will be an actual reboot, as in starting all over? Was Rise not a prequel?

You could get dinosaur eggs, hatch them, and then use them to fight the other dinosaurs, but they didn't really fight: you just clicked on yours, then the wild dinosaur, and they would sort of jumble around. Every character had some catch phrase they would say when you clicked on them. I think Ian would always say ""Good deal"" or ""I'm on it."" At the end there was a bonus level where you were a T-Rex and had to get to a ship to get your baby. I always killed the hot dog stand guy.

1367655397.0	1do4se	Idea for the prefect Jurassic Park game. A mix of Pokemon Snap, Oregon Trail, and Far Cry 3.		9	0	8	"Takes place in the timeline of the second movie.

You play as Jeff Goldblum (not essential, but it *is* Jeff Goldblum).

You choose what equipment and how much you start off with (the garage scene in the beginning of the film). 

You have a camera as your 'main' bit of equipment. 

Main mission is the story of the movie (with added video game scenes).

Free roam is optional, you always carry your camera (and if you want, your weapons) to document the dinosaurs. You get money for the pictures you send to Hammond (this involves recharging camera at base camp, shooting photos of dinosaurs [closer the better, carnivores worth more than herbivores, alive worth more than dead etc], then going back to base to send the photos off) and this money is used to get air supplies of weapons (possibly food [you can scavenge for food as well, it's  hard to collect enough]). Alternatively, you can steal from the 'bad guys' from the movie (so sneak/storm their camp(s) and steal). 

Up to 4 players. If not multiplayer, you can tell NPCs to go off and collect photos, scavenge etc, if you dont have enough food/water for them, they can die.  

I'm not planning to make this because I dont have the skills/time/money, just a thought I had seeing as the games available aren't *that* great. I guess it could be a Far Cry 3 mod. What do you think?

However when rumours spread that the T Rex was killed by a larger dinosaur, he sets his sights on that one for revenge. This also serves as a bit of a fan service for when he finds and kills the Spinosaurus.

And a big part of that was trying to incorporate things like being warm blooded, being related to birds, not dragging their tails, etc.  Now since the original movie came out, scientists have learned that many dinosaurs, particularly the theropods that ""star"" in the films had feathers.

This is my first Reddit post, I've been resisting making an account for over a year now but today I finally gave in.

Anyway I was watching JP: THW last night and something about it has been bothering me. 

When Ian is talking to John in the beginning of the movie, John explains that Isla Sorna is where they were supposed to breed the dinosaurs before bringing them to Isla Nublar. 

However, in the first movie it shows the whole raptor birth scene (and eggs) and it gave me the impression that the dinosaurs breed, born, and matured all on Nublar. 

I don't know if this question even makes sense (it's late lol), but does anyone have an explanation?

1363136919.0	1a6pjg	Just saw a screening of JP 3D - experience spoilers within	Shark_Dog1	8	1	5	"Just saw a screening of Jurassic Park 3D on an Imax screen.

As a JP fan, I had been excited to see JP3D for over a year. I made sure not to watch any JP film within the last few months to make the experience as seemingly new as possible.

My thoughts (experience spoilers below)

It was a great experience. I hadn't seen JP in a while (and didn't remember the cinema experience from back in the 90's), and it really is a movie made for the big screen. 

[Now, the 3-D wasn't great. As I have found with most movies where 3-D was added in post-production, the 3-D really doesn't shine or add anything demonstrable to the experience. In fact, IMO, other than in closeup shots, such as interior environments, the cars, etc, the 3-D seems unnecessary- and seems to hurt the eyes after a while. Those of you expecting to jump out of your seats when the T-rex chases the Jeep will be disappointed. However, the sound was AWESOME. I shook in my seat when T-Rex turns and roars towards Grant  as he sparks the flare. The special effects hold up well. Other than the Brachiosaurus sneeze (which never looked good IMO) the gallies and a few seconds of the raptors in the kitchen, I'm still amazed by the work of Spielberg, Amblin and co. from so many years ago. Don't go because it's in 3-D. Go because](/spoiler) it's one of the greatest movie experiences of all time the way it was meant to be seen- on a giant screen. Please, chance it"	t5_2sdsw	True

1. In TLW its open and less dense than in JP///, ive heard that in TLW there was a drought but have also heard that its a seperate less dense part of the island.

2. How come the teams in TLW diddnt encounter the Spino? Different part of the island again maybe?

3. TLW raptors had no feathers but in JP/// they got em. Ive heard that the TLW ones are all female. But ive also heard that there different sub-species.

4. In TLW there are ""free"" Pteranodons yet in JP/// there all caged up. Sub-species again?

Now aside from the questions about the island itself how bout InGen?

1. In JP/// they hint that InGen is doing things that are off the list. Grant says ""I wonder what else they were up to."" Is InGen going to take a turn to be like Weyland-Yutani from Aliens? Or was it just a mis-classification?

1343142882.0	x2qku	My dream synopsis for Jurassic Park 4!	doctorbooshka	9	2	8	Let us hope they get Sam Neil to at least have a cameo. I think he should become more like a John Hammond character. Let it be set in the future and they can make him look like an old man running a a company which protects people from Dinosaurs in South America. In the time between movies 3 and 4 the dinosaurs finally breach land in the northern part of South America and in Central America. In a panic America places a 100 ft electric which was built by Ingen. After the company survived a near Enron fallout they invested their last stocks in the electric fence projects which were used on Isla Sorna for the park. The government bailed them out in order to contract them out to he American-Mexican border. Now Ingen had become in bed with the US govt. and worked there way back into the genetic research side of things. In an effort to recover their research from the islands affected by the dinosaur insurgence they launched a military operation to transport as many dinosaurs to a research base in Texas. Before the ships could get back a militant animal right activists set charges in the boats in order to sink right of the coast setting the dinosaurs free. This was the biggest messup in history. Now dinosaurs run rampant throughout South America and began breeding rapidly. Soon 15 species of Dinosaurs were killing and destroying villages and soon towns. Sam Neil has sent his team on a mission to Venezuela to find a scientist who has created a virus that will only infect the dino's. Now they have to fight their way through militias and dinosaurs to make it from the border of mexico all the way to Venezuela. This would be my dream movie! 	t5_2sdsw	True

that was the single greatest movie going experience of my life.

The visual effects were absolutely incredible. I've always thought JP held up well over the years but seeing it on the big screen brought it to a whole new level. And the 3D was hands down the most effective I've seen in a movie thus far. The level of depth in some of the shots was always there, but you don't truly appreciate it until you see it in the 3D. The kitchen scene, Gallimimus chase, Brontosaurus feeding scene, helicopter coming into Isla Nublar...it was all breathtaking.

The score, T-Rex roars, were BOOMING. I've seen this movie countless times now but it was brought to a whole new plateau of amazing. After 20 years, it still got shrieks from every T-Rex roar and laughs from every single one of Malcolm's lines. People were ""...oh shiiiiiit"" every time a raptor's head popped up and just generally captivated. Really speaks to the staying power of this movie. I wish more action movies learned from this. They all don't have to be vapid, mindless nonsense.

1358292617.0	16ndn0	My possible plot for JP4. Let me know yours!	naturallycontrary	10	4	6	"My idea:


The idea of a small number of people stranded a dinosaur infested island after willingly going there with limited equipment is a silly idea, and JP3 was most guilty of that. People don't want to go places like that.


So the park has been reclaimed after a massive attempt by InGen to reinstate a working (and safe) resort on the island. After several months of incident-free operation, the park is visited by a representative of the U.S. government. The representative informs the new C.E.O. of InGen (who is just as enamored with the dinosaurs as Hammond was, having been named his successor by Hammond himself) that due to InGen's massive debt and a few illegal actions taken while reclaiming the island, the United States government is repossessing all InGen properties--including the dinosaurs.


Now obviously the new InGen C.E.O. fights this tooth and nail and comes to find out that this decision was pushed through by a lobbyist representing a rival company which will receive much of InGen's properties and records. I think that this corporate wrestling match would ideally take up the first third of the film, allowing viewers to become invested in characters (including one employee of the park who is a handler and appears to have strong opinions about the well-being of the animals)and to be reintroduced to the wonder of the idea of a park filled with dinosaurs (and in true movie fashion, T-Rex, the velociraptors, and other carnivores won't be shown until they are actual threats).


So the litigation continues until, eventually, it becomes apparent that the park is closing down and the dinosaurs are going to have to be hauled off. Representatives from the rival companies arrive and pick and choose which dinosaurs are worth transporting and which are not, with the latter being killed, allowing the main characters (as well as the audience) to regard the dinosaurs as living animals rather than movie monsters. Of course, the majority of animals chosen are the more...voracious ones.


The animals are caged in criminally small quarters and tranquilized for transport. They are loaded onto one of a handful of ships that cast off for the mainland. At this point, the handler is revealed to the audience as a radical animal-rights activist. This character's morals break upon witnessing the cruel treatment of the dinosaurs and he begins to neglect their tranquilization and the dinosaurs become rowdy. Then a storm comes through and a combination of bad luck, disruption by the handler, and the incompetence of the company taking control of the dinosaurs renders the ship without power, in a storm, with raptors loose in the halls (imagine the suspense there). The main characters jump ship and weather the storm which casts them away on a nearby island.


Here the question comes up: are there dinosaurs here as well? The main characters are wary and decide that the safest path is to go for higher ground (what appears to be a plateau) and begin to journey into the island, resting in trees for safety and always keeping a lookout for dinosaurs, but they see none. They soon discover that the island is volcanic and that the plateau is a volcano. They pick their way up and get a good view of the island. It's tiny. And worse: their dinosaur-laden ship has been beached on the opposite side. At once this is a blessing and a curse. The dinosaurs are on the island and likely wandering towards the main characters, but the human castaways now have a goal and a place from which to possibly call for help.


At this point the characters must begin making their way towards the boat, perhaps being attacked by a T-Rex near a lava-flow or a raptor attack in an area filled with hot springs. They may be cornered into caves and flee raptors in a claustrophobic subterranean chase. I believe that there are unexploited ideas to still be used on one last tropical island dinosaur romp of a movie. And if Hollywood is interested in making more films, let them explore what could happen once this rival company gets the other ships filled with dinosaurs.


***TL;DR: New park built over old one. InGen dissolved in corrupt move by U.S. gov. which is pushed by a rival company that gets ahold of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs get shipped out, but one ship runs aground on a small island with a variety of treacherous tropical landscapes.***"	t5_2sdsw	True

It's long but here's my response:
Sorry to whoever took the time to do this, but no, just no.

First of all, let me start out by saying that 1. calling people ignorant for complaining about the idea of remaking JP when you sit there calling people whiny and dumb fanboys makes you look really rude and ignorant yourself and 2. you are being ignorant by not thinking this thoroughly and assuming Universal can pull whatever out their butts to do whatever they can whenever they can because you demand it. Your youtube channel is full of very rude and childish comments in reply to other comments that have been removed by you or other’s down votes which shows they probably wanted to write their opinion but you or others felt like they didn’t matter.

With that said, I’ll explain why I don’t agree with this at all. From here on I will complain (ignorantly) and be a whiny dumb fanboy(girl).

I run iheartjurassicpark with over a thousand followers who love the original movie for what it is. Many of these people including myself have read the books. I understand when people complain about book &amp; film adaptation but we need to understand that no movie is ever going to be exactly the book it adapted from. This is because of time and money. It costs a lot of money to film on locations, props, makeup, costumes, etc. The list goes on. Film to book adaptation is a very costly and timely responsibility.

Like said, I’ve read the books and I don’t see how much different they are except a few character changes and details. As a whole, they are just about the same.

Also, Jurassic Park (1993) won many awards and is one of the best movies to be made. They made $914,691,118 worldwide off this movie. I highly doubt they would do this again unless they do it many many many years from now (and it will probably end up being bad like the rest of remade films).

Film wise, the 93’ movie is amazing - CGI, animatronics, and all. It’s was basically the birth of amazing CGI work. I honestly believe that whether or not a person dislikes the movie they can’t sit there and say it was poorly filmed, especially because it was a little different from the book.

While Jurassic Park II: The Lost World wasn’t as up there as the first, it still wasn’t all the different from the book either.

Not to mention that Michael Crichton himself did the screenplay for Jurassic Park. That’s kinda like telling him he didn’t do good enough approving the movie that adapted from his own book.

Plus, if you haven’t noticed, Jurassic Park IV is being made and Steven is producing it while Johnston is directing it AND Jurassic Park is being remade in 3D. Think about it. Why in the world would they spend the time and money to remake the Jurassic Park movies?

You also mentioned that if Universal is hesitant about remaking the movies because of the whiny fanboys who commplain (ignorantly) about the idea of remaking JP… there was a solution for this, which was to convince them to get spielberg to be the producer of the remakes. Why in the world would we want him to produce it? “Hey, the same guy who directed the first film is supervising the remake! That’s Great!” You think that because Steven Spielberg isn’t going to direct it, will make it better and more like the book? No. Steven and Crichton were good friends and Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time. Who would you want to direct it? Johnston over Spielberg? No. Crichton has passed away. Who’s going to work on the screenplay and approve the adaptation, you? No. Plus now, a lot of us fanboy/girls know your evil plan so that’s not going to work :P You’re not going to calm fans by showing that Spielberg is producing it. Were not stupid. That would only make us more upset (as it should that Spielberg isn’t directing the 4th movie. stay optimistic people!)

You aren’t Michael Crichton. Give the man some respect.

“We want these remakes to start being produced while Spielberg is still alive, so that he can be the producer of the remakes.” Wow, that just sounds horrible.

I’m sorry for getting your hopes up but I highly doubt this will happen. If it does it will be years and years from now by some money hungry director who wont make it more like the books. Of course I’ll go see it, but I wont be surprised if it’s bad.

And next time you try to do something like this, be a little more respectful to dinosaur, film, and Crichton fans because here on my blog we are all one and we are grateful for the film and book that both Spielberg and Crichton has given us.

Thanks,
tabitha

Unless, they change genres a bit.

I could imagine different corporations fighting over the technology, for use in new DNA experiments. I can see black market trading and some very interesting sci-fi concepts with cloning and ""playing God"", but I can't figure out how to make it a ""Rawrr, dinosaurs!""-movie.

Perhaps there is a more political approach? Animal rights groups fighting to prevent a second extinction of these precious animals, while the corporations are trying to claim them as copyrighted property?

Military involvement? Will they try to breed weaponized dinosaur mounts/soldiers?

How deep does the rabbit hole go when you start to investigate InGen Technologies? All the way to something like the Umbrella Corporation?

I'm pretty sure it will involve another science expedition to Isla Nublar, which goes horribly wrong, again. At its core, it's mostly just a monster movie with a dinosaur angle, so I guess it's all about characters and cool scenes to make it a fun movie, but I'm not sure how to stretch it out into another trilogy.

1. Pteranodons attacking the chopper? When were there even Pteranodons in the park, and how would Ingen keep them on the island if they were flying free?

2. What happens to Dr. Sorkin's assistant? He practically dissapears.

3. Where did the Raptors come from? Muldoon said there were only three raptors on the island.

4. Why have so much build-up for the Troodon when they have sucha minor part?

5. Mosasaur? How do they even get the D.N.A for that?

1344217452.0	xqpav	Since I saw the other dream synopsis for JP 4, here are a few of my own...	Lawborne	3	1	2	"Alright, I saw somebody posted their idea for another movie so I thought I would post my two ideas.

Firstly, the JP: Origins movie is doing something very similar but I suggest a prequel that starts with John Hammond’s idea and ends with the evacuation of Site B during a hurricane (which supposedly occurs after Jurassic Park if I remember correctly?).  They can even use a lot of the ideas from the Trespasser game (specifically John Hammond’s dialog). Instead of making it a movie, make a mini-series in the same vein as Lost (but obviously only a few episodes and less mystery). You could build entire episodes around things only mentioned in the books or the movies (Lysine contingency, tropical storms, dinosaurs escaping, disease, and industrial sabotage) and you can throw in some complex scientists and zoologists who can expand upon some of themes. A fun idea on my part, but I know it’s unlikely as a mini-series.

Quick [teaser](http://youtu.be/0U_Pnk56pfc) I did for this idea.

My idea for a fourth movie came from the falling action of the first book. It starts off with a drug deal occurring on a dock of Isla Sorna (evading authorities) and a few raptors hitch a ride on one of the boats to a large port in Latin America (like in the book). The raptors wreak havoc on the docks and are killed; it provides the breaking point (after the events of the first 3 films) and the UN is forced to send in teams to destroy the dinosaurs. Like in the book, the team has to account for all of the animals (including the eggs) so they actually have to scout the island (instead of just carpet bombing). Things go to hell when they underestimate the inhabitants as the animals fight for their own survival. What we get is something more akin to a Vietnam film instead of the plot of the first three movies. Some of my action ideas include a raptor attack on a convoy in “the long grass” shot like a zombie attack, the Spinosaurus swimming and attacking an aircraft carrier parked offshore, and a T-Rex chasing an off-road bike. You could even throw in a third act where the characters have to get to the coast before bombers wipe out the island (based on the info collected from the teams).

Anybody want to hear how I would have written Indy 4 while we are at it? I wrote a nine-page outline to prove someone could write a fourth one that wouldn't suck and everyone I've shown it to has been blown away.

1336171010.0	t7kc3	So I just finished Jurassic Park and am about to finish The Lost World. Any recommendations? 		5	2	8	"The style wasn't what I liked so much as the attention to detail. I didn't like the end of Jurassic Park where Ian just babbled on and on and Hammond just took it all like a baby. It felt more like a ""political"" message than storytelling but overall I liked these books a lot. 

The research put into these books are great. It makes me wonder why it isn't real already. It sounds like it makes so much sense!! ""Yes, yes that is how velicoraptors would react. Yes, yes, we can infer that from their behavior. Well duh we would get dna from amber. Uh duh there would be another island.""

1343678661.0	xepew	Jurassic Apocalypse Part 1	doctorbooshka	3	3	2	"The year is 2032 and its October. This month always gave Alan Grant a chill in his bones. His birthday was coming up and he would be 86. In his older age his traumatic experiences from his past would haunt him in the hallways of his over sized house. He always had to make sure his grass was cut because of an abnormal fear of tall grass. Dad never told us why he was scared of the tall grass. When I was younger he would make me mow it. He promised after he would tell me the stories of the dinosaurs he claimed to have seen. Ill be 21 this month, Alan and I share the same birthday. Weird how those things happen sometimes. My mother died when I was young and it changed my dad forever. Then 2 years after my mother died the incident happened.

The year was 2021 and it was an October like any old October. I was dressed in an Indian Jones costume from the new movie Indian Jones Vs. Zombies. I was already to go and I was going to meet my friends at the park in my neighborhood. I was watching an episode of the Walking Dead Animated Series when an emergency signal began to blare over our surround sound. My dad came into the room and asked me what I was watching. And before I could tell him that this wasn't a show, the President was on the screen. 

""Ladies and Gentlemen of the United States. I have some tragic news to bare. The South American continent has been invaded by strange creatures. We believe these creatures to be genetically engineered dinosaurs made by a cell of terrorists from the middle east. A boat carrying these dinosaurs which we discovered last week were on there way to a research facility in Nevada. They were nearing the coast of South America when a bomb was detonated on the ship allowing it to sink in shallow water. The terrorists then boarded and released the Dinosaurs from there storage facilities. In an attempt to keep the Dinosaurs from coming to America we have a defensive maneuver almost ready to be turned on. InGen Electric has created a set of 100 feet tall electric fence designed to keep these dinosaurs at bay. My heart goes out to those being affected there. It turns out over 5,000 creatures were released. We are sending aid and soldiers to help there efforts. God Bless America!

The screen returned back to the cartoon. This day was the day our world ended.

An accurate portayal of The Lost World novel. Considering 99% of the book plot was not in the movie, I think this could work out very well. Even if Jeff Goldblum didn't reprise his role, you could easily write a new character in. 

Maybe Richard Levine is friends with an InGen employee who worked on the Jurassic Park project and when the friend mentions to project to him, he gets curious and decides to check it out. Remove the Sarah Harding (or rename) and follow the plot of the book and you have yourself a whole new plot that directly uses the source material.

1345322201.0	yfx97	Some Jurassic Park criticisms &amp; questions	evansreddit	3	4	18	"Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. But here are some question/criticisms I've thought about, I'd love to hear more opinions as well.

1. What does the safety of handling dinosaurs and loading them in their pens have to do with the safety of the tour? If a lion attacked someone handling it at a zoo, would they bring in a bunch of experts to go on a zoo tour?? I think they'd inspect the handling process.

2. How does a visitor ever see a raptor in that pen?? Is there an underground room with windows or what?? Do visitors get out of the car to walk to it?

3. I hate how Nedry's death was handled like a cartoon. There's a goofdick cartoon slipping sound when he falls in the stream. Then the dilophosaurus appears in the jeep before he gets there like a Droopy cartoon.

4. Why are there action scenes not involving dinosaurs? We have an island full of dinosaurs, yet there are scenes where a car ""chases"" them down a tree, and Tim has to climb a fence faster than Ellie can turn electricity on?

5. Generally I dislike the pure-luck timing of a T-rex coming in and fighting the raptors to save the day.
