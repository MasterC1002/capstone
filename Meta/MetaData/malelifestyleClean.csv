Affronter	379	72	95	"Howdy gents - I'm writing this post more for myself than for you, as I want to make a list of necessary and comfort items I've used during my years as a Green Beret and airborne infantryman. This list could be used for guys who are going to fly to Paris on a play date with their girlfriend, but its really written for dudes who are actually jumping into the breach and going someplace more austere. A lot of this is irrelevant to a lot of guys simply because each location requires different kit, but I'll try and keep it legit.


SECTION I: BARE MINIMUM FOR TOUGHING IT.

This section is about your actual movement through country - the second is more the niceties I like when I know I'm not getting shot at, having to move through rough terrain constantly, dodging insane taxi drivers, whatever.

Boots for Toughing it:

First, and most importantly, is boots. To make a recommendation of brand or style would be foolish because it obviously depends on where you're going and what fits, but let me give you some general advice on buying and wearing them:

* If you're moving out for long periods of time under weight, your feet will grow. I've gone up two sizes in the past three years, and had to move to wider boots. The less details and straps and shit that is on them, the better.

* If you buy gore-tex boots for anything other than snowy conditions, you're going to regret it. The gore-tex keeps moisture out, but it also keeps it in, and even if you're moving through streams and creeks, your body heat will dry your boots out in a matter of miles. Change socks, when you get wet or too sweaty, use wool ones or wool blends. You want those wheels to breathe!

* I like Darn Tough brand socks; keep a few spare pairs in an accessible spot on your pack, along with toenail trimmers, tiny scissors, and moleskine. If you get a hotspot, don't wait till it turns into a blister. Make use of medicated foot powder. Take them off and dry your feet out whenever you get a chance. If you're really going to be moving out, read [Fixing Your Feet](http://www.amazon.com/Fixing-Your-Feet-Prevention-Treatments/dp/0899976387) - worth every penny. Even if you're going to Manhattan for a week, you should have this book.

* Get ones with a higher stovepipe if you're going to be under weight, jumping out of airplanes or helicopters, or just moving across rougher terrain. Trails aren't rough terrain -  untouched slopes of the Hindu Kush are. Spare laces, or a fat wad of 550 cord.

In case you can't tell, I really care a lot about feet. Thats because its the linchpin on just about any traveling you'll do as a gentleman. If you're going on a long movement, spend several weeks toughening up your feet and don't be that guy who buys new boots beforehand. Break them babies in. That book has some advice on it, but the gist is toughen up by doing what you're gonna be doing with the weight you're gonna be doing it with in the gear you're going to be doing it in.

Misc Tools for Toughing it

* A good knife has saved my ass more than once. I like [ESEE Knives](http://www.eseeknives.com), but a good folder by Benchmade would suffice. Used for cutting shit, like cheese and bread, and the throats of marauders.
* A multitool, and a spare. 
* A half dozen carabiners of various sizes - the little tiny ones come in handy more often than not. You can clip shit to your bag that won't fit, or things you need quick access to.
* A G-shock watch, and then a dressier watch like a good plain ol analog timex. If your'e one of those guys who spends $500+ on watch to fly around the world with, I'm just gonna know that you're an amateur. 
* Water carrying container - Nalgene or similar. Wide mouth makes it easier to eat soup or spoon shit into.
* Headlamp - think about batteries. My Petzl has been through something like three years of deployments and a few times through the washing machine
* Small but beefy combination lock.
* One of those microfiber towels that roll up tight and dry fast
* Flipflops for airing your feet out. If you get some classy ones, you can wear them out and about in the right situation
* Gorilla Tape (100mph tape) good for damn near everything. I pull off about 10 feet and then roll it into a flat, more packable shape. Don't skimp on this shit, get the good stuff.
* Gorilla Glue and super glue. Good for fixing shit and closing wounds
* Small first aid kit, situation dependent. You probably do not need QuickClot, you probably do need tweezers and some bandaids. 
* Bungees for lashing things down come in handy, you only need three or four

Bags for Toughing it

* Get something with an internal frame. 
* Don't be one of those slick faggots that buys something that looks cool, with leather straps and brass buckles, when what you need is lightweight nylon webbing, beefy plastic buckles (and spares) and a few external pockets. 
* I squish all my shit into heavy-duty zip-lock bags, so when it rains, I'm not carrying a bucket of water on my back with all my other kit. Some dudes get issued these big waterproof bags that are pretty nice because it'll help you float your shit if you have to cross a river. 
* Make sure everything is adjustable and don't buy anything until you've put it under load. REI is great for this sort of things, they're awesome about returns. I also bring a lightweight backpack for little day trips. 

""Sleeping bag"" for toughing it

I don't use one. I have an [ENO](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com) hammock (get the double-wide and buy their straps, too) and in weather I use a waterproof poncho and a 'woobie' or [U.S. Army Poncho Liner](http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Military-Weather-Poncho-Blanket/dp/B001L0VX2W). If its really cold, I'm already wearing insulated clothing so the hammock keeps the cold ground away, the blanket and the woobie are enough to keep the rest warm. You can get some ultralight sleeping bags that compress down pretty well, but I've found for most moderate climates those items are the best as they take up little space.

Clothing for Toughing It

* For cold weather, I layer like this: Silk, synthetic wool, outer layer of cotton/poly blend or gore-tex. 
* Avoid thick cotton and denim. Jeans are okay in the desert.
* Overall you want to be as lightweight as possible and stay away from pure cotton, unless you know you're not going to be in someplace cold - cotton kills people all the time because it loses its insulate properties once it gets wet

If you're moving out like you should be, this is all you're gonna need. And of course lots of socks. 

(And let me rant for a minute here. Unless you're going to a desert that actually has dust storms, don't you dare wear one of those keffiyeh. When I see some hipster walking down the street with one of those, its just an embarrassment. Don't do it. If you want to wear a scarf, wait until its cold and then go buy a proper knit one, jeez. Those things are for keeping the mucky dustrain that comes about in a legitimate sandstorm you massive tools. I keep a faded bandana to wet and tuck under my cap in the heat, otherwise, just have lots of socks and tshirts. Socks. Good ones.)

When I travel to the desert regions, I like to pack some linen pants and a lightweight collared shirt, just in case. And then for everyday wear I use arcteryx pants and/or shirts, or any of the synthetic stuff they have at REI is great and affordable too. Try and get subdued colors so you don't look like a flashy asshole. Avoid logos and stuff that gives away your nationality - your'e trying to blend in and learn about the culture, not parade about.


SECTION II: COMFORT ITEMS

* I bring a pipe and tobacco for myself. For everyone else, I make sure I have marlboros for bribes or making friends. If you do one thing, bring Marlboros and a lighter - if you've got friends, you can get everything else you need.
* Caffeine pills, and Melatonin. One is for beating jet lag to the East, one is for beating it to the West. 
* Caswell Massey cologne &amp; soap. 
* A solid dopp kit bag - if you can, find a waterproof one for when your shit cracks open and spills your stupid hair gel all over. Real men just shave it off, gents.
* Kindle with lots of books, iPod, and some good adapters. Spare headphones. Some of you may want to bring a good camera, but I wouldn't recommend a laptop - too many distractions! If your'e bored, start walking and meeting people, you'll learn more and make some lifelong friends, not like these reddit scoundrels telling you what to pack and how to dress ;)
* A safety razor with blades, and good shave soap.
* Clarks desert boots are classy, versatile, and comfortable
* Sunglasses. You want something that covers up your eyes fairly well to prevent dust. I know those aviators look cool, and I've got a pair, but you'll regret it the first time the rotor wash or prop blast blows a fat load of moon dust into your eyes. Those American Optical glasses seem to stand up pretty good.
* Inflatable pillow is nice to have!
* No gentleman travels without a deck of cards and some condoms
* An [Opinel No 10](http://www.amazon.com/Opinel-Knives-Corkscrew-Knife-Handles/dp/B001BEL9U4) has gotten me laid a couple times, not gonna lie
* [Dalvey Flask](http://www.dalvey.com/shop-online/compasses-outdoor/dalvey-flask-cup/stainless-steel-detail)
* A freakin notebook and pencils, duh.

Some other adventure tips:

* Photocopy your documents/passport and email them to yourself, and leave copies with someone you know

* Call your bank ahead of time and let them know your'e traveling so they don't lock your card up for weird activity

* Password protect and log out/clean of all your shit before you move out - in some countries, porn, music, and photos are verboten - just keep your shit buried, man

* Call your local travel clinic and make sure you've got all your shots, and make sure you've got enough Doxy to cover your malaria and whatnot

* Learn a few basic greetings and/or write them down for yourself. Most people will be happy you're at least making an effort


There's a lot of little comfort items and kit that I'm sure you all are happy to recommend/add to this list, but I'd consider this the minimum for me, and I've enjoyed quite a bit of fun &amp; travel with these items. Less is more, man.

By Henry Rollins"	lucubratious	102	13	12	"I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.

Completely.

When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me “garbage can” and telling me I’d be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn’t run home crying, wondering why.

I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.

I hated myself all the time.


As stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn’t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you’ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time. I didn’t think much of them either.

Then came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the blackboard. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.

He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred-pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn’t even drag them to my mom’s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.

Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.’s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn’t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn’t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.

Weeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn’t know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.

Right before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away. You couldn’t say s–t to me.

It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn’t want to come off the mat, it’s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble. That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can’t be as bad as that workout.

I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn’t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you’re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.

I have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone’s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr.Pepperman.

Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.

Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.

Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn’t see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.

I prefer to work out alone.

It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you’re made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me how to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it’s some kind of miracle if you’re not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.

I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.

Through the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.

The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back.

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds."	t5_2sk0u	True

Im 29, and I think I've been psyching myself out for years.  I get super nervous when it comes time with a new girl and I can never stay hard while I put a condom on.  I am in reasonably good shape and health, but one time a few years ago I thought to myself ""image if I couldn't get it up, ha"" while about to do it.... and then I couldn't.  Ever since then whenever I'm about to get it on I get hard and then I loose it right when it counts.  I try my best to relax, breathe slowly and deeply, but no luck.  I'm wondering if maybe I should get an Rx for viagra or something just once or twice to give myself confidence, hopefully, but I could see it continuing the same way or even making it worse.  I'm a pretty big dude (bigger package, not fat), if that matters.... have any of you guys experienced this?  Any way to get through it?

Now don't get me wrong, I love a lot of the articles posted here, and many of the blogs that they link to. But the problem with this is that it creates a much more passive subreddit. It just becomes a place for interesting articles/pictures/videos about stuff we consider manly. There's no definite place for us as a subreddit to just chat - such as the general discussion threads on /r/malefashionadvice

What initially made me think of this was how many of the articles that I've read both here and around the internet deal with men bottling up fears and anxieties, from major life choices to something that you won't remember a week from now. What if this sub addressed that, provided a place for a man to come with his concerns and worries without fear of judgement?

What do you guys think about this? Would you like to have discussion oriented threads, or am I in a minority?

For me a 21st birthday is traditionally a 'coming-into-manhood' event (even though I'm Australian and drinking and voting and such is legal at 18 here), and I'd like to think of some gift ideas to fit that. Thing is, I don't smoke or drink and I don't plan on starting, so I haven't been able to think of much more than good quality wallets, watches, razors or cufflinks that you would keep for your whole life and possibly hand down to future generations. If anybody had any other manly gift ideas that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!	t5_2sk0u	True

I'm only 25, he's the first of my close friends to get married and I've never done this before.  I've never even been to a bachelor party.

Are there any good guides or books I should take a look at?  As I see it my responsibilities are as follows:

* Speech

* Embarrassing photos maybe

* Bachelor party
    * For this one, I am not a fan of crazy drinking parties, but he is.  I assume the preferences of the groom-to-be would take precedence, correct?

Guide me, wise men of reddit.

Basically brothers. He's one of my best friends.


He just asked his long term girlfriend (6 years now) to marry him, this summer before he starts medical school. Naturally she said yes. They had planned on getting engaged.


r/malelifestyle - what now? What should I be doing for them? What can I expect?


I am assuming that I am in the running for best man, but at the least will be included in the wedding party. Regardless - this is my first time ever having to deal with something like this, and I want to make sure I handle it properly.

I know the two of them intimately. He is like family, and she has been around for the entire time I've known him. Both of them have seen me through some troubling times, and a lot of good times too. I want to make sure I do something special.

Some things I am considering.

For the engagement itself:

* Do I get them an engagement gift? What would be a good gift? Something small right? for the two of them too, not just him or her?

* Do I take them out to a dinner to celebrate? We have a great place in our college's town that we frequented a lot - I was thinking of going there.

Stag Party

* Make sure he stays out of handcuffs.

* Make sure he has a blast.

* Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid or jeopardize his relationship in any way (not a problem)



Wedding

* Should I ask to be involved in the planning process? or help out at all?

* Price range on gifts? Again, roommate for 5 years, like a brother to me. He is a big tequila drinker, so there is always that... but I feel like that's childish...


I'm literally stream of consciousness thoughts right now, and rambling.


Thanks for any/all input or advice guys.

1374266597.0	1inly4	Request for some manly challenges.	trent599	63	13	71	"This year, I've been assigned as a Residence Advisor in an all-guy's first year dorm. I've been thinking about some cool stuff for my guys to do, (I've already bought the N64 and Mario Kart) and I came up with the idea of having weekly challenges to help these guys transition from being high school boys to college guys. Of course, I want it to be fun as well.

Thusly, I'm here to ask you folks for ideas. I need about 35-37 challenges to cover every week, so throw me your best ideas.

The ones I've come up with so far:

* Introduce me, properly, to 5 guys from the other floor. (I cover both basement and 1st floor)

* Attend a lecture outside of your planned major.

* Buy a pair of classic dress shoes at the thrift store.

* Learn proper squat, deadlift, and bench press form.

* Pull a number from a girl/guy you are interested in, call, and ask for a date. This one is a pass for those with SO's already.

* Call your mother. She misses you.

* Try a drop-in sport and/or martial art.

* Learn some form of partner dancing

* Go watch a Varsity game.

The only real guidelines I need to follow are not encouraging them to drink or smoke, and occasionally encouraging their academic work. As long as they follow those rules, all suggestions are welcome!

**Edit:** Thanks for all the great ideas gents. I'll post the full updated list sometime soon, and see about making the weekly challenges a weekly posting on malelifestyle."	t5_2sk0u	True

We're becoming an increasingly active and growing community, and as we've recently passed the 17,000 subscriber mark, the time has come for us to have a logo that represents us.

**Criteria**:


1.  The logo must be 120 px (w) by 40 px (h).

2.  The logo must include the 'Male Lifestyle' name in it somewhere.

3.  The logo should properly encapsulate the spirit of the subreddit.  See the sidebar for more information on this.

4.  The logo must be safe for work.

5.  (Optional)  We'd prefer a .png file format and a transparent background, so that the logo can be used even if we change the header at some point.

The logo does *not* have to contain the Reddit alien, but you're welcome to include it if you wish.

**Resources**:

Use the [vector pack](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17474926/DO%20NOT%20MOVE/reddit_vector_logos.zip) for logo template if you'd like, or check out [Pineapplecharm's logo archive](http://pineapplecharm.com/reddit/index.php?d=1) for inspiration.  (I borrowed these resources from /r/redditlogos, so they deserve a shoutout here.  Their sidebar is also great for logo design tips.).

Check out the /r/TodayILearned logo as an example of what can be accomplished.

If you need a freeware photoshop alternative, check out [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/).

**Rules**:

Enter your submission as a comment in this thread.  The competition begins immediately, and will end Sunday, December 16th, 17:00 GMT.

I have a vehicle that's about fifteen years old and has roughly 200k miles on it. I take care of general maintenance myself, (oil changes, other fluids, brake repair, tire rotation, etc.) and it runs quiet and excellent. Haven't had any major repairs in a few years, and I paid it off long ago.

Although it runs great, I have tons of dents and scratches all over it. I refuse to care about the appearance, as I think it's a waste of money to wash it and fix dents and cosmetic things like that. I don't want to buy a new car until this one costs me more than a new one would, so I'll probably keep it for a while. I have friends that have bought a few new cars in the time that I've had mine, but I also know that I'm able to invest much much more than they do since I'm not inundated with expensive car payments, taxes, and insurance premiums.

They can also be used for self-defense.

Both of these pursuits (hunting, self-defense) interest a lot of guys, so I figured this belonged here:

There are a couple of organizations that are offering shooting instruction nationwide, often for a fairly modest cost (50 - 100 bucks).

[Project Appleseed](http://www.appleseedinfo.org/search-states-map.php) offers rifle marksmanship instruction nationwide.

The NRA actually has an outstanding education wing.  Their advocacy organization gets them in trouble for being overly political and dogmatic, but seriously, their education side is phenomenal and gets overlooked because of the political stuff.  [Find a course near you with this tool](http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx).

---

If you decide to take a class, contact the instructor ahead of time if you don't have a firearm and see if you can arrange something.  A lot of folks / places will let you rent or borrow one to learn with.  Failing that, phone up that gun nut buddy of yours and see if s/he will help you out; most of them will be glad to do so.

I've taken out a handful of women so far this year, two of which I have been interested in continuing to date.  Both of the women I liked, I've gotten no further than a second date.  I dated a lot last year and had similar issues, then took a break.  All the rejection feels painful to me. Sometimes I feel angry &amp; frustrated, not so much at the women directly, but at the notion that my dating life is outside of my control and that my need for female companionship isn't being filled despite honest efforts to do so.

I see myself as an outgoing, attractive guy, who's funny, athletic, has a career, and is caring.  I don't want to be an angry or jaded person, but I also see the need to date to find a partner.

Upon walking into work this morning, I asked myself what someone who was confident would do in my situation.  My answer was that they would be in a place in which they wouldn't have these painful feelings about the situation, they would just go on with life and live happy, somewhat like a happy, aloof fool.  Next, I realized that this image is somewhat unreal as you can't just get rid of your emotions (its unproductive as I saw and unhealthy).  Then, it hit me....

I don't have a good idea of how to deal with rejection from women.  Mostly, I hate the painful feelings that come along with it.  I keep trying to get rid myself of them and have realized that this is a dead-end road.  So what do I do?  What do you do?  How does one handle rejection from a woman like a man?  Specifics would be great!

UPDATE 1: To clarify, this is not a post about ""how to do a get a date?""  I'm putting myself out there and actively dating. Active dating means lots of rejection (at least for me!)  I'm looking for healthy ways to deal with the rejection, especially when it keeps happening over and over :)

UPDATE 2: I think its useful to also add that most of the women I've dated I've met through online means like match.com, eharmony, and okcupid.

UPDATE 3: First time making it to the front page, not sure if pathetic or great =) (I smell a meme)

UPDATE 4: Realized that I don't know how to use reddit that well yet.  We are only on my front page :P"	t5_2sk0u	True

1374681383.0	1iyne6	Looking to make my bedroom a little more mature/manly.	ajk511	51	13	35	"So I've had the standard metal bed frame on wheels and no headboard forever and I'm looking to upgrade. Right now my room looks like a teenagers room, only cleaner and much more bare. I have queen bed in the middle on a metal frame, a cheap brown MDF corner desk from office depot, and a super old dark brown night stand. I don't want to break the bank here, so originally I was looking at the Ikea Malm frame, but I've never seen one in person and I can't tell if it looks cheap or like it belongs in a dorm room. Any ideas for a cheap, mature and good looking alternatives to Ikea the Ikea stuff? Also need to buy a dresser and matching desk, another reason I was attracted to the Malm series from Ikea since it would all match and be relatively cheap. The closet at my apartment is full of storage, but having all my stuff in there on wire racks and having a 50 inch tv sitting on a 10 year old cheapo MDF desk from office max looks like crap. Any help is appreciated in advance.

1339609294.0	v04vf	how do I decorate my apartment in a comfortable, affordable, temporary, manly way?		38	2	23	"I'm moving to Colorado in six weeks from NY for a new job. I just paid the security deposit for a 1BR apartment in a complex (sight unseen) and will be moving there. The pictures show pretty a pretty standard area...white/cream walls, grey/tan carpeted floors, white kitchen tiles. The structure is bedroom, kitchen, living area. the living area would be a dining/chilling combo. The apartment is small...479 sq ft. 

I want to make the place look unique and comfortable (make it my own) but not spend much money on furniture, as I will very likely only be living here for one year. I also don't want to make any major changes to the place. I might ask them if I can paint my bedroom but that's about it.

Some ideas I had already were to just buy a futon for my bed that can double as a couch if I'm entertaining. Buy a coffee table with pillows for asian themed eating if I'm entertaining. *I don't plan on entertaining much because I don't know anyone there yet* I'll need something for my clothes in addition to my closet. I'll probably buy plastic shelves?

Sure, I can put some posters and paintings up on the walls, but what ELSE?

Other thoughts to consider: I want to get into painting, so I might have my own little painting area in the corner of the living room. I don't want a tv in my apartment, so the focus of the living room area will be just relaxing or eating or meditating or listening to music or sitting and drinking with a few peeps. 

A nice little TINY workout area might be nice to sit and stretch and bust out some pushups or whatever else. Maybe I'll buy a yoga mat for this?

Any input would be appreciated. I want to make this place unique and feel at home. It's very important to me because I am moving far away from my friends, family, and girlfriend to a place I have never been to start a new job fresh out of grad school. Lots of changes."	t5_2sk0u	True

I wanted to share a really useful set of concepts related to this topic.

The most important element of any self-protection plan is awareness.  It doesn't matter what sorts of tools or training you have if you never saw the threat coming.

The system I'm about to introduce will help you and your loved ones avoid all manner of danger.  Not just muggings, but falls, getting hit by a bus, and just about anything else.

Let's think about states of awareness for a second.  This will allow us to recognize our own state of awareness, and modify it when necessary.


I will list each state by its name, and will correlate it with [Jeff Cooper's color codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cooper#Combat_Mindset:_The_Cooper_Color_Code):

**Unaware**  (AKA:  Condition White)

Referred to by anatomists as craniorectal insertion, this is the state of being entirely oblivious to your surroundings.

Once you know what to look for, you will see people in condition white all the time.  People walk around absorbed in their smart phones, lost in thought, et cetera.

If you've ever been out in public, and be entirely surprised when someone you knew tapped you on the shoulder, you were in condition white.

The problem with condition white is, *it is a state of vulnerability*.  People in condition white wander into crosswalks without looking, and they stand out to criminals who are looking for an easy target to rip off.

The only time you should be in condition white is inside your home, with the doors and windows locked.

**Aware** (AKA:  Condition Yellow)

This is a state of relaxed awareness.  Not anxiety.  Not expecting ninjas to jump out at any moment.  Relaxed awareness.

If you're in condition yellow, you know what's going on around you.  You have a rough idea of who is in your vicinity, where they are located, and what they are doing.  You don't get surprised by people coming up and tapping you on the shoulder, because you glanced and saw them coming your way a few moments ago.  You are always looking for lanes of access and egress; emergency escapes, exits, ways to get out of the place you're in quickly.

You are not lost in thought or in an electronic device.  You are monitoring your surroundings and thinking about the world around you and what is happening.

Your mindset is, ""I may need to protect myself or my loved ones today,""

whether that's pulling them out of the way of a bus, keeping them from falling down an open manhole, or dealing with a violent criminal.

If you're outside of your home, you should be in at least condition yellow at all times.

**Alert** (AKA: Condition Orange)

A specific potential threat has been identified.

""There's a bus coming, and I don't think it's going to stop.""

""That guy has been following me for three blocks, and we're getting into a sparsely populated area.""

""I think I smell smoke in this restaurant.  Is the kitchen on fire?""

Now that you're aware of a specific threat, it's time to focus your attention there and develop a plan.  'If the bus keeps coming, I'm going to yank that kid out of the street,' or 'If he keeps following me, I'm going to turn and face him.'

Start thinking about how to use those lanes of egress you identified earlier and position yourself to get into them, if necessary.

You're not sure the threat is a danger yet, but you're focused on it.

If you have protection tools (pepper spray, a firearm) it might be time to access them (but not draw them) if you can do so discreetly.  (A hand on the pepper spray in the pocket, for example, so you don't have to fumble for it.)

I will sometimes take evasive action at condition orange to confirm the threat.

For example, if I'm driving, and I get the sense that a car has been following me for a long time, I might circle the block.  If the car is not following me, it will leave at some point.  If it isn't, it'll still be there (at which time I would drive to the police station).

**Alarm** (AKA:  Condition Red)

I don't mean that in condition red, it's time to panic.

Alarm means [a call to arms](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alarm#Noun), or a call to action.

The threat has been identified, and the threat is real.  It's time to act.

The mugger is approaching with the rusty screwdriver.

The bus is bearing down on you.

The restaurant kitchen is on fire.

It's time to put that plan from back in condition orange into action; get out, or use your defensive tools, or do whatever you need to do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and alive.

---

I like to play games to keep my awareness sharp when out in public.  I try to make sure no one can sneak up on me.  I try to see how many different ways I can monitor my surroundings discreetly.  (It's always fun to open a door for someone walking behind you without ever having looked at them; reflections in glass doors and windows are fantastic).

I quiz myself of the people around me (how many people behind you are wearing hats?).  I people watch.  I mentally kick myself if I ever get caught in condition white, and think about what I did to cause that to happen.

None of this is professional advice.  I'm not a lawyer or expert of any kind; if this information is useful to you, use it.  If not, don't."	t5_2sk0u	True

1375252723.0	1jen9l	The recent post about not being able to handle whiskey inspired me to write a quick guide to entering the world of whiskey for those of you who don't know how.	theholidayhawk	29	3	9	"Most people believe that whiskey and other distilled spirits serve only one purpose. That purpose is to get a person drunk as quickly as possible. While this certainly is a viable use for whiskey it is not the only one. For many, including myself, whiskey can be enjoyed for its flavors and aromas, even when not drinking enough to get drunk. This idea is obviously foreign to many. The reason for this is that most people simply have not been drinking quality whiskeys; rather they choose their whiskeys for quantity. 

The purpose of this guide is not to try and get you to stop drinking whiskey as you most enjoy it, nor do I wish to belittle the idea of getting drunk as it can be fun and a great male bonding experience. The purpose is to simply expose you to the idea that there are other ways to enjoy it so that you can better make an informed decision as to how you drink. Getting trashed and enjoying good whiskey are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but the decision is yours to make, and it is yours alone. In my opinion making your own decisions is what part of being a man and living the male lyfestyle is. If you only want to drink whiskey to get drunk, and not for the other qualities of the whiskey, stop reading here.

The first barrier that is in the way of a person enjoying whiskey is the harshness of the beverage. Some you will find to be very harsh, some only a little bit, and some of the best (and as a consequence likely more expensive) have almost none. Often harshness is due to the high alcohol content. There are several ways to get around this. First, is to use water to reduce the alcohol content. This can help to release the aromas and flavors as well as cut the burn from the alcohol. Second, ice can be used; this both reduces the alcohol content and cools the whiskey. Both the reduction in percentage and the cooler temperature will help cut the burn, however the cooling will also act to reduce the flavor of the whiskey. Third, and possibly the best, is to use a whiskey nosing glass such as a glencairn or copita. These have a “tulip” shape and help to concentrate the aromas of the whiskey making it easier to smell, which is also a very important aspect tasting anything. Snifters can also be used for nosing whiskey, though they are usually nor preferred. Over time a person will get used to the sensation of alcohol and with practice and patience they will learn to deal with it without having to think very much about it. 

Sometimes the harshness can come from the flavor profile of the whiskey. Not much can be done about this other than ice and cooling the whiskey. However, the best way to avoid it is to not buy whiskeys that you think taste bad.

Once you have dealt with the harshness of a whiskey you will finally be able to taste and nose the whiskey. Nosing should come first. It can help ease the drinker into the whiskey and can give a good idea of what to expect from tasting it. Smell is also an important aspect of taste, thus smelling it will help you get more flavor out of tasting it. Once again, practice is the only way to improve your nose and taste buds. 

The technique for nosing is fairly simple. Swirling the whiskey in the glass will help increase surface area of the whiskey and release more of the particles that create the aroma. Then, placing your nose in or near the top of the glass, inhale through your nostrils. Being able to do this without getting a nose full of alcoholic burn is a matter of practice and experimentation to find the right spot to place your nose and how to inhale.

When tasting it is often best to start with a relatively small amount of whiskey and move it around your mouth, then swallow. Many whiskeys will have unique flavors and finishes, meaning that the flavor may change after you have swallowed the whiskey. Some of the heaviest whiskeys have very long finishes that can last well after the liquid is no longer in your mouth. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of drinking whiskey.

I will also include a short list of some of the most highly suggested beginner whiskey brands for those people who have never heard of any other than Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, and Johnnie Walker. These aren’t my favorites, but they are the ones that most beginners tend to enjoy and they aren’t very expensive. There are many types of whiskey out there, all of which have their own unique flavors. The only way to find out what you like is to try them.

Bourbons: Makers Mark, Buffalo Trace, Rock Hill Farm, Four Roses, Evan Williams (Comes in Black Label and Single Barrel), Old Grand-Dad (Comes in 80 proof, 100 proof, and 114 proof), Bulleit.

American Rye: Bulliet Rye, Rittenhouse Rye, Dickel Rye, Russell's Reserve Rye.

Irish: Jameson (Comes in several types), Bushmills, Tullamore Dew.

Scotch: Highland Park 12, Glenfiddich 12, Laphroaig, Macallan.

If you have further interest in learning about whiskey /r/bourbon, /r/Scotch, /r/whisky, and /r/worldwhisky are all great resources for find new and exciting whiskeys as well as learning about the processes of making different whiskeys."	t5_2sk0u	True

1360855917.0	18inhz	Keeping keys from wearing holes in khakis?	neozz1	42	18	25	"Some info.... I basically wear khaki dockers for work everyday and have wore small holes in two pair over the past few months from accidentally rubbing up against something.  Both holes happened from keys being in the spot that rubbed.  For reference I work in IT fixing comps, crawling under desks, etc... 

I have two sets of keys with me at all times, one personal set with a car key, car button thing, house key, small thumb drive, and electric door opener sensor thing(about the same size as the small thumb drive) none of which are really optional to not have.  Second set is about 8 keys for random doors at work and another electric door opener again all of which I use everyday.

Solution?  Only thing I can come up with for now is to put them in my coat pockets, because I have my coat with me basically all day.  Once it warms up the only thing I can think of it to get a clip type thing and just clip them to a belt loop.  Is there any other better solution you guys are using?  I am familiar with the devices that cut all your keys and put them in a little slider but my car keys make that not an option.  Also I dislike and prefer not to leave my keys setting places so not having them on me is also not and option.

Thanks for any insite you can offer.

TLDR: Need to have two sets of keys on me but stop them from being in pockets rubbing holes in pants"	t5_2sk0u	True

1354310405.0	142koa	Manly Book Review:  John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government	Deradius	28	10	6	"I just finished John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government.  In specific, I read the [kindle edition with a brief opening commentary by Macpherson](http://www.amazon.com/Second-Treatise-Government-Annotated-ebook/dp/B004PYDBYY/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354309421&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Second+Treatise+of+Government).

For those who don't wish to pay 99 cents, it is available for free on Kindle or [at this link](http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtreat.htm).

I'm going to do my best to keep this post as politics free as possible.  Where I touch on a sensitive issue I'll try to report as objectively as possible.  If I fail in my objectivity, feel free to engage me on it and I'll do my best to clean up this post.

Locke's treatise, published in the 1690s, is the font from which much subsequent thought and scholarship on civil government springs.  If you are familiar with the founding documents of the United States, you will be immediately struck by the powerful influence Locke's thought had on the unfolding of the American Revolution.

Locke lays out the rationale for why civil governments are established and exist; the preservation of the innate right to life, liberty, and property of its citizens.

Further, Locke deals extensively with when one ought or ought not be able to defend one's own life, liberty, and property, when and how states of tyranny and despotism come about, and when it is or is not acceptable to replace one's government.

Many readers may take issue with several of Locke's assertions, including but not limited to how ownership of property comes about and whether innate rights exist.  Locke frequently falls back on theist justifications for his position, but I contend it is possible to find secular justification for most of his assertions.

The book was a dense read in places and Locke's 1690 vernacular can be a little tough to follow, but overall I found it to be an engaging read.

Macpherson's commentary is essential, as it lends some key perspective on Locke's writing by discussing Locke's social class (he was a member of the landed, wealthy class) and pointing out some of the broader claims made by Locke outside of this specific work.

Macpherson also makes some important fundamental points I hadn't considered.  For example, he notes that before one can have a well-developed theory of government, one must first propose a theory of human nature to serve as a foundation for the theory of government.  (We need to understand *why* people need to be governed before we discuss *how* to govern them in an informed fashion.)

This book ought to be required reading for any gentleman with an interest in civics, American history, government, or self-reliant living."	t5_2sk0u	True
