Hey guys!  It's time for round 2 of Cocktail of the Week.  This week I'm doing another absolute classic.  Perhaps it's THE classic American cocktail: the Sazerac.

[Recipe from Dale DeGroff's *Craft of the Cocktail.*](http://i.imgur.com/Hvzj3.jpg)

[Recipe from Jim Meehan's *PDT Cocktail Book.*](http://i.imgur.com/hvCPk.jpg)

[Recipe from promotional card at Sazerac Bar in New Orlean's](http://i.imgur.com/lHyML.jpg)

Now this is peculiar.  All of the above recipes are very different from one another.  How can that be, in this Classic of Classics?  If you read the blurbs in the top two recipes, you'll see that this cocktail changed recipes part way into its life.  It was originally made with Cognac, but then changed to Rye Whiskey.  Some believe that this is due to a shortage of cognac caused by the [Phylloxera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera) plague wiping out grape production in Europe.  

What all of the recipes seem to agree on is that rye and Peychaud bitters are definitely in this cocktail.  Personally, my version is closest to the promotional card (no angostura).  Here's what I do:

- 2oz Rye Whiskey

- 4 dashes Peychauds (don't be stingy here)

- Absinthe rinse

- Lemon twist

- Sugar Cube

Muddle a sugar cube into the bitters (perhaps adding a bit of water to encourage dissolution), then add rye whiskey.  Stir over ice until chilled, then strain into absinthe-coated rocks glass.  Garnish with lemon twist (I express the oils on top, but that's up to you.)

This time around, I used Willett 4 yr Rye, and Grande Absente for my absinthe substitute.  

**Results**

Good lord do I love this cocktail.  I am a sucker for good Rye whiskey, and this is THE cocktail to show off a good Rye.  The aroma of the lemon oils hits you first, with some of the absinthe and peychauds in the nose.  As you taste it, the rye bite is there to greet you, with the subtle nuances of absinthe behind.  The flavor of Peychauds is also very present, and complements the tiny bit of sweetness from the sugar.  Amazing.  

[Enjoying it in a special glass from the Sazerac Bar in New Orleans](http://imgur.com/RC473.jpg)

**Cheers!**

This is one of the most famous cocktails of the pre-prohibition era, and is an absolute must for any cocktail fan's repertoire.  It's easy, fairly fast, and tastes amazing.  I'm sure most of you have tried this one before,  but if you haven't, make one! you'll thank me.

Got any Sazerac stories?  Any variations on this classic?  Any suggestions for next week's cocktail?  Feel free to comment below, or PM me.  I'll see you all next week!

The world seems to be nearing the peak of a long-needed cocktail renaissance and our subreddit is all but defunct. I started this dedicated account to hopefully stay motivated to post often. I am going to try to add meaningful comments to everything I can and (apologies if this gets super annoying, it's well intentioned) posting random rough draft cocktail recipes every day with some beginner-friendly commentary. I work in a ""mixology bar"" with Bartender's Choice on the menu so I slap new drinks together on the fly daily but taking the time to think/discuss them would certainly be beneficial to my own growth as a 'tender. Love them, hate them, think they were dreamt up by a TGI Friday's flaretender? Tell me! Make fun of me! Curse me out! Just write something...please?

Kapeesh? Here goes the first one:

* **Possible Drink Name**: *Louis Pasteur's Revenge*^1
* **Ingredients:**  

        +  1-1/4 oz. Del Maguey Mezcal Vida (^2)  

        +  3/4 oz. Angostura Bitters (^3)  

        +  1/2 oz. Grapefruit juice (^4)  

        +  1/2 oz. Honey Syrup (^5)  
  
        +  1/2 oz. Heavy Whipping Cream (^6)  

        +  1 whole egg (^7)  

        +  3 drops of Orange Blossom Water (^8)  

        +  Peel of a grapefruit
* **Directions:** In a cobbler shaker *without ice*^9, add the mezcal, bitters, honey syrup, cream, and egg. Cover the shaker (still *without ice*) and shake vigorously and thoroughly, approximately twice a standard shaking time^10. Open the cobbler, add the grapefruit juice and top with ice, cover and shake even longer and with more vigor than the previous shake. Once your arms feel like they are going to fall off, shake longer^11. Strain into a chilled collins glass (collins glass *without ice* as well). Top with soda past the rim so the luxurious foam is overflowing, slide the grapefruit peel down the side of the glass, and spread a few drops of orange blossom water across the cloudy 'n creamy top. Option: straw/no straw? (I feel weird putting straws in glasses without ice. It's a weird OCD thing that doesn't matter, up to you. Luckily my bar has a grip of those stainless steel weighted straw doothingies laying around.^12)
* **Flavor Notes:** Not for those uninitiated to the self-aggrandizing world of mixologists. If you aren't scared away by the whole egg in your drink, the bartender basically dumping a bottle of bitters into your glass, the ashtray/barnyard nose on the mezcal, or the OBW's ability to cause a Proustian rush to the time in middle school when you accidentaly dumped an entire bottle of your dad's cheap Brut aftershave on yourself and spent the rest of the day trying not to gag at your Jersey Shore-ready odor....if you still drank the cocktail then I say welcome. You are most likely a cocktail geek.

For a while now, I've wanted to start a weekly post series where I choose a cocktail, post the recipe from a few sources, and make/drink it.  I figured what better day to start this endeavor than Repeal Day? So without further ado, I'll start with one of my personal favorites:  The Last Word.

[Recipe from Jim Meehan's PDT Cocktail Book](http://i.imgur.com/8MqlP.jpg)

I'm only including one recipe on this one, because the recipe for this drink is well agreed upon.  It is truly an idiot proof cocktail:  four ingredients in equal parts.  For my own swipe at this one, I used [Waterloo Gin](http://treatyoakdistilling.blogspot.com/2011/11/treaty-oak-distilling-proudly-announces.html), a local Gin in Austin, TX.  For Maraschino, I used Luxardo.

What can I say about the Last Word!  A true classic.  The herby flavors from the Chartreuse are tempered by the maraschino and lime, and gin notes rest at the back.  With 3/4 ingredients being booze, this drink is no lightweight, yet it is light on the palette and very drinkable.  

**Variations:**

- Garnish with a Cucumber slice

I love doing this; the fresh aroma of cucumber complements the flavor of this drink very well.

- Jalapeño

Muddle a small slice of jalapeño in the drink before shaking.  Gives the drink a little spice and jalapeno flavor, which I like in this cocktail.  Can't really be called a Last Word anymore though.

- The Final Say:  Sub Bourbon or Rye for the gin, and (if you wish) lemon for the lime.  

Helpful for those who just will not drink gin.

**Cheers Everyone!**  I hope that some of you who haven't ever tried this drink will give it a whirl, and that those of you who have will revisit it.  If you have any other variations you like to do on this classic, or any corrections, go ahead and post them below! See you all next week!

So my goal for this column is to roughly feature the following each month: 2 classic drinks, 1 simple drink, and 1 modern drink. So far I’ve written up the classic [Bobby Burns]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) and the deceptively simple [Manhattan]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/) cocktail. This week I return to a classic cocktail, the Corpse Reviver #2. Given the lengthy treatise on the Manhattan cocktail last week, this week’s post will be briefer. 

**Background**  
I really wonder what it would have been like to live in an era where having a couple of these at breakfast to “revive you”, aka fight off last night’s hangover, would have been like. The Corpse Reviver #2 is the most well-known of the Corpse Reviver “series” of cocktails, though I have not come across any solid existence of a #3. This is another classic cocktail that has enjoyed its own namesake revival of late in cocktail bars.  

**Recipes**  
*PDT Cocktail Book*   
* 0.75 oz Beefeater gin  
* 0.75 oz Lillet Blanc  
* 0.75 oz Marie Brizard Orange Curacao (I substituted Cointreau)  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
Absinthe rinse  
Shaken on ice, strained into coupe glass  

*Savoy Cocktail Book*  
* 1/4 wine glass Lemon Juice (approx. 0.5 oz.)  
* 1/4 wine glass Kina Lillet  
* 1/4 wine glass Cointreau  
* 1/4 wine glass Dry Gin  
* 1 dash Absinthe  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass

*Links and further reading*  
[Savoy Stomp](http://savoystomp.com/2008/07/28/corpse-reviver-cocktail-no-2/)  
[Cocktail Spirit](http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/434/cocktail_spirit_corpse_reviver)  

**Results**  
This is a very refreshing cocktail, not bracingly sour as many classic cocktail recipes seem to be. Thanks to the absinthe rinse, you get a herbaceous sweet aroma which gives way to a well-balanced fruity and sour cocktail. It is definitely a cocktail that keeps inviting you back for another sip.

**Variations**  
There are a couple interesting variations on the classic Corpse Reviver #2 that I have encountered, the first of which is to increase the amount of absinthe present, as tested by [Kaiser Penguin](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/recipe-comparison-corpse-reviver-2/). In my experience, the absinthe in the original recipe seems to only contribute to the aroma of the cocktail, so adding some anise flavor could contribute to some pleasant complexity, though I would be cautious of overdoing it.   	
Another variation that I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying is a barrel-aged Corpse Reviver #2. Though hard to remember the exact experience, I remember that it resulted in a sweeter and mellower cocktail likely due to the lemon juice losing its bite. In addition, because of the exposure to wood, its color had changed from white to a pleasant light brown. Though not true of all barrel-aged cocktails, this version is definitely something worth trying if you are lucky enough to come across it. 

**Lillet**  
Lillet is a fortified wine, similar to dry vermouth, made from a blend of Bordeaux wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle) to which citrus liqueurs (made from sweet orange and bitter orange peels) and quinine, the bittering agent present in tonic water, are added. It is actually a rather delicious aperitif, suitable for drinking before dinner on ice. The original Lillet used in many of the cocktail recipes found in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* call for Kina Lillet. Unfortunately, this product no longer exists as the company that produces Lillet decided to reformulate it in 1986 and rename it Lillet Blanc, which is intended to be “fresher, fruitier, and less bitter”. An alternative Lillet is Cocchi Apertivo Americano, which is reported to be closer to the original Kina Lillet than Lillet Blanc. As I haven’t yet gone through my bottle of Lillet Blanc, I cannot verify this claim, but perhaps more educated folk could report in. 

**Cheers!**

I think Negronis are fantastic - equal measures of 3 ingredients and a slice of orange peel. And to me, it really doesnt matter if I'm stuck using Gordon's and Martini Rosso. It's still great. A foolproof classic. 

I also really like champagne cocktails, though it does make me sad when people order a Bellini and insist on a good vintage. My dad used to have fresh oysters and Black Velvet (equal measures Guinness and Champagne) for breakfast on Christmas day, as a child I didn't understand it. Now, it's one of my favourite things about Christmas.

It was bound to be featured sooner or later, and as my favorite cocktail, I figured now was a good a time as any. Plus, I’d like to have at least one cocktail each month that can be achieved with a basic bar setup. This is going to be a really long one since I love this drink (I had to cut out almost 1/3 to fit the character limit), so go mix yourself a Manhattan, then come back and enjoy. 

**Background**

The most famous and fantastical origin story of this drink is that it was created in 1874 for a party thrown by Winston Churchill’s pregnant mother at the Manhattan Club in New York. Though a nice story, ultimately both David Wondrich in *Imbibe!* and cocktail historian William Grimes in *Straight Up or On the Rocks* debunked this story as she was not in New York at that time. The Manhattan Club does have records of a Manhattan cocktail being invented there, but without any date attached (date your notes!). The most likely, yet least confirmable, history of the Manhattan cocktail comes from William Mulhall, a bartender in New York in the 1880s. He claimed that the Manhattan cocktail was invented by a Broadway saloonkeeper known simply as “Black” in the 1860s, who I envision as a shadowy sorcerer of spirits. It’s a mysterious story, but amazing that this cocktail remains one of the most well-known today.

**Recipes**

*[My preferred Manhattan](http://i.imgur.com/AjdC1.jpg)*:

* 2.5 oz Rittenhouse Rye BIB [bottled-in-bond]

* 1.0 oz Dolin Rouge

* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stirred on ice and strained into a coupe glass

Garnished with homemade Montmorency cherries on a pick (in order of consumption): rye+Peychaud’s, spiced rum+cinnamon, amaretto (details below) 

Disclaimer: this is a stiff drink as 2.5 oz of 100 proof rye is equivalent to two normal 1.5 oz pour cocktails. I should probably halve this recipe but I can’t help myself. 

*The Savoy Cocktail Book*: 

*Manhattan Cocktail (No. 1)* [originally found in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas’ *Bar-tender’s Guide*]

* 2 dashes Curacao or Maraschino

* 1 pony rye whiskey [approx. 1 oz]

* 1 wineglass vermouth (mixed) [approx. 2 oz, equal parts sweet and dry?]

* 3 dashes Angostura bitters

* 2 lumps of ice

Shaken on ice and strained into a claret glass 

Garnished with a quarter of a slice of lemon in the glass

Two dashes of gum syrup optional

*Manhattan Cocktail (No. 2)*

* 1 dash Angostura bitters

* 2/3 Canadian Club whiskey

* 1/3 Ballor Italian vermouth

Shaken on ice and strained into a cocktail glass

Garnished with cherry

**Results**

If I were forced to choose only one cocktail to have the rest of my life, it would have to be this. I always forget how much I enjoy this cocktail, as I honestly cannot condone having one of these every night, but that first sip is like slipping into a custom-tailored suit. You remember how well it fits and how comfortable it is. The initial note is always the spiciness of the rye whiskey, which immediately matures into the fruitiness of vermouth that tames the drink, and evolves into the herbal and bitter notes provided between the vermouth and Angostura bitters. My garnish being three distinct cherries just adds upon the complexity of this drink. The first cherry being soaked in rye whiskey+Peychaud’s complement and amplify the spiciness of rye and briefly take this drink in the direction of a Sazerac. The spiced rum and cinnamon chip soaked cherry turns it exotic with the strong flavor of cinnamon playing a harmonious counterpoint to the cloves in Angostura bitters. Near the end of the drink I enjoy the amaretto soaked cherry, with its naturally complementary flavors. It provides a sweet finish to my drink and reminds me that one is probably enough. 

**Variations**

There are countless variations on a Manhattan cocktail; I’ll briefly go over a few here. The most common variation on a classic Manhattan is using bourbon in place of rye, common in the South. A less common variation is to substitute brandy, which, according to Dale DeGroff in *The Craft of the Cocktail*, is common in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The “Perfect Manhattan”, unfortunately not a literal epitome, is a Manhattan whose vermouth portion is equal parts of sweet and dry. Recently, artisanal distillers have started to put out unaged “white dog whiskey” aka moonshine.  A “White Manhattan” is often a Manhattan cocktail made with “white dog whiskey”, dry vermouth, orange bitters, and garnished with a lemon twist resulting in a clear cocktail that is Manhattan-inspired. I am personally not a fan as I find it barely has any resemblance to the flavor profile of a Manhattan cocktail, but it is an interesting variation you may encounter. On the note of lemon peel/twist, this is another acceptable garnish in a Manhattan, though be sure to properly express the lemon oil if you choose this route. 

**On Cherries**

Grocery store “maraschino cherries” in the United States are vile and as with many cocktail stories, this can all be traced back to Prohibition. Maraschino cherries, in the early 1900s when the cocktail scene was really getting its legs, were originally made from Marasca cherries sweetened and preserved in Maraschino liqueur, also made from Marasca cherries. Marasca cherries, native to Europe, are sour cherries, along with the Morello and Montmorency. In 1906, the USDA defined a Maraschino cherry as thus. Sweet cherries, such as the Royal Ann, were being grown in the United States and preserved in a similar fashion, but were required by law to be called “Imitation Maraschino Cherries”. 

When Prohibition was enacted in 1920, Maraschino cherries became much more difficult to import and demand as a cocktail garnish dropped. So the American entrepreneurial spirit came up with a novel way to prepare cherries using a chemical brine and preserving them in a sugar syrup rather than alcohol. By the time Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the American palate had already become accustomed to the sugary variety that we recognize as a “maraschino cherry” today. 

By 1940, the FDA had [redefined](http://1.usa.gov/ZYfba9) a maraschino cherry as “cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar and packed in a sugar syrup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor.” Interestingly, the original dye, Red Number 4, was banned in 1960 for having lethal toxic effects on dogs and only allowed for the “maraschino cherry” as they are technically not considered a foodstuff. Although the modern “maraschino cherry” is usually dyed with Red Number 40, I still wonder why bleach all the flavor and natural texture out of a cherry then reintroduce it in the form of sugar and artificial dye?

In summary, the “maraschino cherry” found in every American grocery store is vastly different from the original Maraschino cherry. Firstly, they are produced from sweet cherry varieties rather than sour. Secondly, they are preserved by chemical brine rather than alcohol. Thirdly, they are packed for storage in sugar syrup rather than maraschino liqueur. Finally, they are dyed with synthetic food dye, which may turn out to be toxic.

At this point, you may be asking yourself, what other options do I have? I will present to you three suitable options for garnishing your cocktails. The first, which I personally have not had the luxury of trying, is to purchase the Luxardo brand of Maraschino cherries, which to my knowledge are still produced from Marasca cherries, though not kept in Maraschino liqueur. The second, more budget-friendly option that I have found is to purchase the “Dark Morello Cherries in Light Syrup” from Trader Joe’s. I feel these are significantly better than the “maraschino cherry” as they are at least produced from a sour cherry variety and aren’t artificially dyed. The third, more creative option that I have indulged in, is to simply make your own from dried Montmorency cherries, which again can be found at Trader Joe’s. All I do is put them in a clean jar and cover them with my liquor of choice. There’s no limit to what you could use to flavor them, but I currently have them in rye whiskey+Peychaud’s, bourbon+Angostura, dark rum+cinnamon chips, cognac, and amaretto. Having a progression of cherries over the course of consuming your Manhattan is a lot of fun. 

**Manhattan Crimes**

I initially wrote in my outline that the greatest sin you can commit while making a Manhattan is to shake it. I am confident in saying that the great majority of people would agree with this sentiment. Seeing [Robert Hess’ explanation](http://bit.ly/On071t) as to how unacceptable it is was a formative moment in my cocktail education. Yet, in writing this post, both of the recipes I came across in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* have it shaken. I don’t think anyone’s mind is going to be changed by this fact, but if anybody is daring enough to give it a shot, let me know in the comments.  

I had a friend who, when we went out for happy hour, would always insist on his Manhattan being served on the rocks as he thought he was getting more booze in larger old-fashioned glass. He was summarily proven wrong I strained into an empty cocktail glass. Although it is technically acceptable for the Manhattan to be served on the rocks, I would argue that this eventually detracts from the drink as the ice melts and the drink is diluted. Unlike an Old-Fashioned, the Manhattan already has sweet vermouth to tame the fire of the whiskey, and thus I feel that the addition of ice is unneeded. Ultimately, I am more a proponent of drink what you enjoy, so if you enjoy your Manhattan on the rocks, I respect that. 
 
**Cheers!**

[Week 2: Sazerac](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14qgow/cocktail_of_the_week_2_sazerac/)

Hello, fellow boozehounds!

Sorry I have been on hiatus, but the holidays are a tough time to keep up a schedule.  I am officially moving to Sundays, and intend to keep up my weekly schedule a little better.  So, without further ado, let's make the French 75, a cocktail which, according to Harry Craddock, ""hits with remarkable precision,"" like the 75mm artillery gun for which it was named.

**Recipe: Jim Meehan's PDT Cocktail Book:**

1oz Tanqueray Gin

.5oz Lemon Juice

.5oz Simple Syrup

Shake with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.  Top with 1oz Moët Imperial Champagne.  Garnish with a lemon twist.

**Recipe: Dale DeGroff's Craft of the Cocktail:**

1 ounce brandy

3⁄4 ounce Simple Syrup

1⁄2 ounce fresh lemon juice 

Champagne

Shake the first three ingredients well with ice and strain into a goblet with ice. Top with Champagne.

**My Recipe:**

1oz Cognac

.5oz Lemon Juice

.5oz Simple Syrup

2oz Champagne/Sparkling Wine

Shake first three ingredients, strain into champagne flute, top w/ champagne, garnish with lemon twist.

**Results**

varied set of recipes, huh?  The principle ingredient of this cocktail is actually widely disputed.  Is it gin, or brandy?  The drink turns out very different depending on which spirit you use.  Personally, I use brandy, because it gives you a sweeter drink, which I like here.  Gin gives you a dryer, lighter affair.  DeGroff says the original was made with gin, but it became more popular with brandy.  Ultimately, your personal preference will have to reign supreme.  Make it both ways, and see what you like better!

I adore this cocktail.  In my opinion, it is the king of the morning drinks.  You can all keep your mimosas.  The tartness of the lemon counterbalances the sweetness of the champagne, cognac, and simple.  This drink is light and effervescent, thanks to the champagne bubbles.  An extremely palatable cocktail, this is a good one to introduce your less experienced friends to the art of classy alcoholism.

Here is what mine sort of looks like: [French 75](http://ajanaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Cocktail_French-75.jpg) (image from ajanaku.com)

**Variations**

This one has some fun variations.  For starters, you can vary the recipe:  More or less champagne, brandy or gin, flame the lemon peel or don't.  If you'd like a different flavor, here's a fun one from DeGroff:

**FRENCH 95**

3⁄4 ounce bourbon

3⁄4 ounce Simple Syrup

1⁄2 ounce fresh lemon juice

1 ounce fresh orange juice

Champagne

Shake the first four ingredients with ice and strain into an ice- filled goblet. Top with Champagne.

This one is tasty.  Bourbon is a welcome guest to the party.  I like to use big, high proof bourbons here, as well as strong ryes.  

Another week (several this time around, sorry!), another delicious drink.  How do you make your French 75s?  Do you have any interesting variations on this classic?  Any suggestions for next weeks selection?  Please comment below.  

Cheers!

1373228601.0	1htiba	Moscow Mule: Origins	chalks777	39	5	24	"The story of the Moscow Mule (recipes in comments) starts back in the late 1800s with a company named Heublein, founded by Andrew Heublein.  You almost certainly have had one of the products that they began producing in 1895… A1 Steak Sauce.  When Andrew's son Gilbert took over the company he began to sell premixed canned cocktails as early as 1915.  I found a neat ad from 1940 [showing this](http://imgur.com/Z0Hc1nS).

At some point John Gilbert Martin, the grandson of Gilbert Heublein, took over the company.  We'll skip forward a bit to 1938 when the company acquired the rights to Smirnoff Vodka for $14,000.  Which according to [this](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) is approximately the same as $231,292 today.  Not really a staggering sum for a brand that is now virtually ubiquitous in American culture.  Why so cheap?  The Smirnov (yes, v) family moved to America in 1917 when they were forced to flee Russia during the [October Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution).  While there, Vladimir Smirnov met a man named Rudolph Kunett and in 1933, sold him the right to produce Smirnoff in America.  It sucked.  Nobody liked it.  That's how John got it for the value of the distilling equipment five years later.

There's just one more thing we need to know about.  The Cock 'n Bull.  The Cock 'n Bull was a [bar](http://imgur.com/M049bq2) in Hollywood.  The owner, John ""Jack"" Morgan, also produced the somewhat unsuccessful product ginger beer.  Thanks to Martin's taste for liquor though, it seems apparent that John met Jack at the Cock 'n Bull at some point shortly after acquiring Smirnoff.  Remember this is all on the west coast.

Now all the elements are in place to understand the Moscow Mule.  The story goes like this:

&gt;The mule was born in Manhattan but ""stalled"" on the West Coast for the duration. The birthplace of ""Little Moscow"" was in New York's Chatham Hotel. That was back in 1941 when the first carload of Jack Morgan's Cock 'n' Bull ginger beer was railing over the plains to give New Yorkers a happy surprise... Three friends were in the Chatham bar, one John A. Morgan, known as Jack, president of Cock 'n' Bull Products and owner of the Hollywood Cock 'n' Bull Restaurant; one was John G. Martin, president of G.F. Heublein Brothers Inc. of Hartford, Conn., and the third was Rudolph Kunett, president of the Pierre Smirnoff, Heublein's vodka division. As Jack Morgan tells it, ""We three were quaffing a slug, nibbling an hors d'oeuvre and shoving toward inventive genius"". Martin and Kunett had their minds on their vodka and wondered what would happen if a two-ounce shot joined with Morgan's ginger beer and the squeeze of a lime. Ice was ordered, limes procured, mugs ushered in and the concoction put together. Cups were raised, the men counted five and down went the first taste. It was good. It lifted the spirit to adventure. Four or five later the mixture was christened the Moscow Mule...

It comes from a July 28th, 1948 article in the New York Herald Tribune.  A nice story, certainly.  I think it's a lie though.  In 1951, reporter Aline Mosby tracked down a man named Wes Price… the head bartender for Cock 'n Bull.  When asked how the Moscow Mule was invented he had this to say, ""I just wanted to clean out the basement.  I was tryin' to get rid of a lot of dead stock.  Cock n'Bull ginger beer that we made and 100 cases of **vodka that we had to buy then in order to get other liquors**"" (emphasis mine, from [this article, pdf](http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201951%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201951%20Grayscale%20-%203981.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffccdcfeeb&amp;DocId=2830629&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20O%2dG%2dT&amp;HitCount=8&amp;hits=90b+90c+ad7+ad8+ae4+ae5+136a+136b+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf)).  As an aside, my favorite point from that article is when Wes is talking about the price, ""Several thousand mugs are stolen per year … so we had to raise the price … from 70 to 75 cents""

Anyways, Heublein a company with very popular bottled drinks, held a restaurant over the barrel to purchase their vodka?  Sounds exactly like what a very successful company would do.  I think it's far more likely that the meeting in Chatham Hotel actually happened, but that Jack Morgan used Wes' recipe… the head bartender in his restaurant.  In that same article We said ""I never got an extra cent for my invention, I wasn't truly appreciated.""  Disgruntled employee trying to take credit for something his boss did?  I doubt it.

So, regardless who made the drink Moscow Mule, it certainly became a vehicle for selling the tasteless spirit, vodka.  The earliest ad I found for it was in [1950](http://imgur.com/PLxvtZO).  Pretty cool looking mule.  The next ad I found that referenced the drink was in [1958](http://imgur.com/9JVDkCT).  Both were from Life magazine.  I also found a neat reference to the cocktail in [1947 NY Morning Herald (pdf)](http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald%201947%20Grayscale/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald%201947%20Grayscale%20-%203738.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=3f317332&amp;DocId=6490183&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20U%2dF%2dP&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=14b1+14b2+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf):

&gt;Two couples who swear it wasn't the alcohol… sued a bottling company for $10,000 asserting a lizard crept out of a ginger bottle while they were having their second ""Moscow mule."" … Their complaint stated they became violently nauseated, since then have been unable to sleep soundly and are troubled by dreams of ""mules and lizards""…

Ha.

Now, should you actually drink this thing?  Robert Ruark of [1947's Schenectady NY Gazette (pdf)](http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201949%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201949%20Grayscale%20-%204947.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffec31b786&amp;DocId=2813351&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20O%2dG%2dT&amp;HitCount=6&amp;hits=b1e+b1f+b7e+b7f+cda+cdb+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf) has this to say, ""The Moscow Mule is supposed to be a mild tipple, but it has a habit of suddenly whacking you between the eyes and causing you to walk swiftly away on your kneecaps.""  He goes on to say ""It [Bloody Mary] is not, however, quite so unthinkable as the Moscow Mule.""  Which gains extra weight when you realize he describes a Bloody Mary as ""a nauseous blend""

Personally, I'm inclined to agree with him.  Vodka is such a boring spirit to work with.  When I made the Moscow Mule, it tasted like nothing more than ginger beer with some lime in it.  So, I started making what the internet at large refers to as ""Mississippi Mules""… the same thing, but with gin instead of vodka.  The flavors imparted by the gin elevated the drink a great deal.  While researching I also found that some people would create ""Kicking Mules"" which is the same as a Moscow Mule, but with the addition of bitters.  Combining those two ideas into a Kicking Mississippi Mule is probably the best thing I've done with a cocktail.  Do you like gingersnap cookies?  Because that's what this cocktail tastes like.  EXACTLY.  [Here are two variations I made](http://imgur.com/a/dRWHo)

The Moscow Mule.  A great cocktail that appears to have been invented to sell Smirnoff.  If you want the drink as it was originally crafted, you should use Smirnoff Vodka and Cock 'n Bull ginger beer which seems to still be produced by [this company](http://www.pipelinebrandsusa.com/soda_brands/cock_n_bull_ginger_beer.html).  If you want something that tastes like more than just ginger beer… use gin.

I'm going to commit the ultimate act of blasphemy and say that I don't like the classic martini, in any of the dozens and dozens ways one can be made.  I can't stand dry vermouth, and if you make one of those super dry ones where there's only a tiny splash of it, it tastes too much like pure gin.  Orange bitters are only a tiny improvement.  I think olives taste vile, and while I've never tried a Gibson, I don't think an onion is going to suddenly make me love it.  The only configuration I can say I enjoy is to go heavy on the bitters only use a barspoon's worth of vermouth (or even less), but by that point it's basically a pink gin.

What are yours, /r/cocktails?

EDIT: Also, I don't see what the big deal is with gin and tonic.  I'm always underwhelmed by them.  I keep trying them, hoping someday it will magically ""click,"" but I still find them irredeemably dull.

EDIT 2: Also, Negronis.  They're delicious if you halve the amount of Campari and vermouth, but I don't understand why the classic 1:1:1 ratio is considered perfect and foolproof.  I've yet to try a Negroni variant with that ratio where the bitters and vermouth didn't completely overwhelm the base spirit and make the whole thing tastes like botanically infused cough syrup."	t5_2qpco	True

See, having a cocktail of the week is cool, but also problematic. It limits discussion because there's only one cocktail to chat about, and because not everyone has all the ingredients necessary for a quality cocktail.

So why not try ingredients. Same principle, but better because (1) we can suggest and discuss multiple cocktails that use this ingredient and (2) it's a great way to introduce newcomers to slightly more esoteric spirits – say lillet blanc. As an offshoot, we could start building a wiki/faq thread that could briefly mention each ingredient and the associated cocktail with the most upvotes, eventually getting a pretty solid list of quality drinks.

I'm not opposed to making it a 2-week kind of thing, either.

I'd suggest we avoid something as broad vodka for a while, and instead stick with more flavoring agents. If you folks are interested, tomorrow I'll set up week 1 and we can go from there. "	t5_2qpco	True

Not in an alcoholic sense, but in a way that he knew what was good, and it sure wasn't vodka and Red Bull. His drink was always a Perfect Brandy Manhattan. I haven't been able to figure out the brandy part - for some reason, the upper midwest subs brandy in for whiskey in a lot of cocktails. But Grandpa would always order them at dinner, be sipping on one at family gatherings, having me bring him ice from the freezer for one. 

My grandfather passed away last week after a good life full of friends, family, and barbershop quartet singing. After the service, family and friends gathered to send him off with cocktail or two. There was only one drink on the menu, and it was his Perfect Brandy Manhattan. The recipe is below - have one for George!


George's Perfect Brandy Manhattan

2oz Brandy (we used E&amp;J, because it's what he used)

0.5oz dry vermouth

0.5oz sweet vermouth

2 dashes bitters

3 neon red grocery store maraschino cherries on a toothpick

We started with a blackberry mint julep

Blackberries and mint muddled with simple syrup, then bourbon and prosecco, though next time I'm going to try without simple syrup, a little sweet. :)

Then this lavender cocktail, but she took the recipe home with her! From memory it was lavender simple syrup, lavender dry carbonated water, triple sec, absolut lemon flavored vodka and a splash of chambord (sp) and surprisingly, it was my favorite :)

Third we had a scary concoction. Vodka c-monster. It's just a vodka cranberry with 1 packet emergen-c. Yea my friends drugged me !!!!

Then I made the nasturtium. Sp? The one with st Germaine, aperol and bols something or other gin. Very popular. :)

After that, a French martini: vodka, pineapple juice 1.5 oz each then .5 of raspberry liquor.

Finally, a chocolate/caramel dessert martini. Delicious with Godiva liqueurs along with caramel. We had tiny glasses and it was still too rich.

We had sandwiches and salad for lunch (late) as well as an afternoon swim. Maybe not traditional, but it was damn fun.

Anyway, thank you for your recipes/advice. I've told my friends about you so we don't get drugged again (lol!!!) and hopefully I'll continue to learn more. 

Love you guys!!"	t5_2qpco	True

* 1 oz. Sweet Vermouth (Dolin)

* 2 healthy dashes bitters (Fee's aromatic)

Stir and serve neat garnished with one homemade bourbon cherry dripping in it's own juices.

Homemade bourbon cherries:

Bring to simmer just long enough to disolve:

* 3/4 packed cup brown sugar

* 1/2 cup bourbon (Bulleit was used)

* 2 tsp cinnamon

* 2 tsp vanilla extract

* 1/2 tsp nutmeg

* 1/2 tsp cloves

Pour warm brown sugar bourbon spice syrup over 1 pint of cherries. Seal and let set refrigerated for a few days.

Use whatever rye/bourbon and vermouth you want. Carpano Antica with your whisky of choice might be an improvement, but I think the cherry is what made it really shine through to me, Luxardo's ain't got nothing on these for this drink.

I’m going to give a shot at taking over this weekly cocktail feature and use it as a platform to showcase new cocktails that I’ve come across and enjoyed. This week’s cocktail is the Bobby Burns cocktail, which first appeared in the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, which is an essential book to own in this day and age of classic cocktails. I chose this cocktail because I’ve felt like I don’t have many scotch-based cocktails in my repertoire (other than the Rusty Nail and the Blood and Sand) and I really ended up enjoying this one.  
  
**Background**  
The Bobby Burns cocktail is named after the Scottish poet Robert Burns, who is known as the national poet of Scotland and beat out William Wallace for the title of “The Greatest Scot” on Scottish TV. I also learned writing this post that he composed the words to Auld Lang Syne, so we’ve all undoubtedly been exposed to and/or participated in a reading of his work. 
  
**Recipe**  
There are a few recipes that you can find online, but the original recipe in the *Savoy Cocktail Book* is:  
* 1/2 Scotch whiskey  
* 1/2 Italian vermouth  
* 3 dashes Benedictine  
Stirred on ice and strained  
Garnish with a lemon peel

**Results**  
For my first attempt at this I went with what was currently my only scotch whiskey, Glenkinchie 12, which is one of the few single malts from the Lowland region, which I enjoy as a nicely balanced example of scotch. Disclaimer: I made a cocktail from a single malt scotch, but I recently moved and am still in the process of restocking my bar so I worked with what I had. For the Italian vermouth aka sweet vermouth, I stuck to my usual, Dolin Rouge, which I find is a relatively mild and slightly herbaceous vermouth. Benedictine was obviously Benedictine, but I used 1 barspoon of it as I don’t have a good way to dash from the full sized bottle and I’m pretty confident that isn’t intended.   
It was a great cocktail, the addition of vermouth and Benedictine really added to generate a pleasantly fresh fruity note, while still retaining the bitterness, brininess and smokiness of scotch on the finish. I did find that 1 barspoon was a little too much Benedictine, so I would recommend a scant barspoon to anyone measuring with a barspoon.   
I also went out and bought a bottle of Chivas Regal 12, which is a blended scotch, because I knew that I would be enjoying this cocktail for a time and I just felt guilty using single malt, and it was just as delicious. I had a friend comment that this sounded like a Manhattan, which is my go-to cocktail, but it’s probably halfway between that and a Rusty Nail, which is probably why I enjoyed this cocktail so much.  
  
**Variations**  
As seen in the *Imbibe* recipe, modern versions of this cocktail start to skew towards being more spirit-forward  by using more scotch, so if you enjoy your cocktails with more bite, give it a shot.  
Another variation that I have considered, but not yet tried, is to substitute the Benedictine with Drambuie, which shares a similar flavor profile to Benedictine, and is having somewhat of a resurgence in popularity. Both Drambuie and Benedictine are sweet liqueurs with honey, herbs and spices. Drambuie is whiskey-based, while Benedictine is cognac-based, so perhaps Drambuie could potentially fit even better.  
  
**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed adding or rediscovering this classic scotch-based cocktail. Sorry, no photo this week as I didn’t plan on writing this column, but if people like it, I’ll definitely get a picture for next week. Share your thoughts with me below. "	t5_2qpco	True

* step 1: try to find a classic cocktail that meets the (color) criteria.
* step 2: substitute bad ingredients with good ones
* step 3: layered drinks are usually gimmicky, but if you must layer them, each layer should be balanced individually OR the layer must be fairly thin.  or, to add color, use flavored ice cubes (like the aviary does), or foams or garnishes (see 'artisan cockails' by scott beattie)
* step 4: add lemon or lime to balance the sweet.  usually 1/2 oz for every 1 oz of liqueur.

example:

captain america.  three separate drinks:

* top layer: 2 parts gin 1 part blueberry syrup 1 part lime
* middle layer: 1 part gin 1 part dolin blanc
* bottom layer: 2 parts gin 1 part raspberry syrup 1 part lemon

shake the three drinks separately with ice, then layer.  if layers are really important, add a little more raspberry syrup to the bottom drink and a little more gin to the top drink.  you could also add herbs to the top or bottom layers (mint, tarragon, basil, etc), swap out some of the syrup with a liqueur or an amaro, add bitters etc.  

god of thunder.  i don't have any experience with mead.  but i would guess that all that's needed to fix that drink is a 1/2-3/4 oz of lemon.  maybe swap in some aquavit instead of vodka if you want to beat a dead reindeer with the nordic theme.

iron man.  by some miracle, dude almost stumbled upon [blood and sand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Sand_(cocktail)).  it's not a cocktail i like much, but it's recognized as a classic, at least.

the hulk.  obviously needs an overhaul.  if the idea is to have a green drink, then you want something with a lot of green chartreuse, or mint, or basil.

I could tell the waitress wasn't familiar with the drink because she gave me a quizzical look and then asked me to spell it (in her defense - it was a bit hard to hear in the restaurant).  I jokingly told her it was kind of an old man drink. All of us are in our 20s-30s but I was just trying to provide some context in a friendly way. 

She then came back after talking to the bartender to find out what was in the drink. I told her 1 oz. gin, 1 oz. campari and 1 oz. sweet vermouth. She had to come back again to clarify what kind of vermouth. The drink was served on the rocks with an orange wedge and ended up tasting just fine. The only weird thing was that the glass was chilled but that wasn't a big deal. I eventually ordered a second one and my friend ended up ordering one after tasting mine.

I certainly don't fault the young waitress for not knowing the drink; I tipped her 20%.  But its still pretty crazy that the bartender wasn't familiar with the drink. And doesn't everyone have smart phones these days? Then again - I've waited tables but I've never worked a bar so I won't pretend to know how they're supposed to remember all these drinks.

**Starter Kit**

Before I go too far, let me say that you don't need this whole list to start mixing. I suggest starting with just four items that add up to just over $25: [Boston Shaker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NNO2X0), [Hawthorne Strainer](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-1058016-SteeL-Cocktail-Strainer/dp/B0000DAQ93), [Measuring Jigger](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-3105000-SteeL-Double-Jigger/dp/B0036X4YOG), and [Bar Spoon](http://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Spoon-Stainless-Steel-Removable/dp/B000HBOKIA). If you have those, you will be in great shape.

**Shaking and Straining**

*[Cobbler Shaker](http://www.amazon.com/Oggi-Marilyn-Tall-Cocktail-Shaker/dp/B001D7M1S8)* - The most iconic of shakers. This shaker has a metal cup, a tight fitting lid with a built in strainer, and a small cap to cover the top. Much more common in home bars, this little guy is very convenient.

*[Boston Shaker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NNO2X0)* - The boston shaker is really just a metal cup and a pint glass. Inexpensive, durable, and versatile, the boston shaker is the shaker of choice for professional bartenders. [Using a boston shaker is easy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DifX3jbmIXw), and makes you look slick.

*[Parisian Shaker](http://www.amazon.com/Parisienne-Cocktail-Shaker-Strainer-French/dp/B001CDV9N6)* - Similar in style to a cobbler shaker, but closer to a boston shaker in functionality, the parisian shaker uses two tight fitting metal cups to shake drinks. Some say that the all metal construction improves heat conduction, but you could also use a smaller metal cup with a boston shaker if that's a real concern. Ultimately it comes down to style, and the Parisian shaker simply exudes it.

*[Hawthorne Strainer](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-1058016-SteeL-Cocktail-Strainer/dp/B0000DAQ93)* - Used for straining shaken drinks, the Hawthorne strainer is placed right on top of the mixing glass to pour. The perforated metal disk holds back large ice chunks, while the coil captures smaller crystals. If you are going to get one strainer, make it a Hawthorne strainer.

*[Julep Strainer](http://www.amazon.com/Excellante-SLJS031-Julep-Strainer/dp/B001VZAMPQ)* - The julep strainer resembles a big slotted spoon. A julep strainer is used for stirred cocktails, holding back any ice to let the drink pour out. You can see proper straining technique [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npsGOmzfTw8).

*[Double Strainer \(Tea strainer\)](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-3-Inch-Strainer/dp/B001713L84)* - Rarely used by itself, the double strainer is used to remove small particles that the other strainer might miss. Perfect for removing broken up leaves from mojitos, or pulp from fresh juice, or even ice shards from a heavily shaken cocktail, the tea strainer greatly improves presentation and texture.

**Measuring and Pouring**

*[Jigger](http://www.amazon.com/Double-Cocktail-Jigger-Set-Sizes/dp/B001TQ8LO6)* - Because pretenders free-pour. The jigger is a classic way to measure out ingredients for your cocktail. You can save space with a [demarcated jigger](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-3105000-SteeL-Double-Jigger/dp/B0036X4YOG), if that's more your speed.

*[Measuring Cup](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Angled-Measuring/dp/B000ON555S)* -  Among the pragmatic, these angled measuring cups are slowly supplanting the more traditional jiggers.

*[Liquor Pourer](http://www.amazon.com/Spill-Stop-Plastic-Liquor-Pourers/dp/B00125NOSC)* - More often seen in busy bars, these spouts let you free-pour with precision. The spouts pour at a constant rate, so all you have to do is turn up the bottle and keep a steady count. They come in plastic and [chrome](http://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Bottle-Pourers-Set-6/dp/B0009SZZQW), and [some pourers measure for you](http://www.amazon.com/Measured-Bottle-Pourer-Auto-Measuring-Set/dp/B002PH0LF0).

**Stirring and Muddling**

*[Bar spoon](http://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Spoon-Stainless-Steel-Removable/dp/B000HBOKIA)* - A long spoon with a shallow head, the bar spoon is perfect for stirring drinks, fishing olives out of long jars, occasionally measuring an ingredient or two. [Properly stirring a drink](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npsGOmzfTw8) is a skill, but the twisted handle will help you get the hang of it (straight handles are also available if that's your preference). The biggest choice in the spoon is what goes on the end. You can get a weight or disk for muddling, a fork for fishing out garnishes, or simply a decorative tip.

*[Muddler](http://www.amazon.com/Wooden-KegWorks-Cocktail-Bar-Muddler/dp/B001CDO9QA)* - Muddlers are basically sticks for crushing fruits and herbs in your glass. Wood muddlers are classic, but hard to clean. [Plastic muddlers](http://www.amazon.com/Polycarbonate-Bar-Muddler-Netted-Head/dp/B001VZAXC8) are readily available, and get the job done just as well.

*[Swizzle](http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/product-p/oth_swizzlestx_0000_reg.htm)* - Far from necessary, these wooden sticks are the traditional way to stir some tropical drinks. Unless you plan on hosting a tiki party or running a poolside bar, you can get away with a normal spoon.

*[Straws](http://www.amazon.com/Cocktail-Stir-Straws-Count-Black/dp/B001DI2UWE)* - Anything you serve with ice benefits from having a straw to stir with as you nurse your drink. Long [drinking straws](http://www.amazon.com/Boardwalk-50PBLK-Plastic-Swizzle-Unwrapped/dp/B004NEW8RM) are a must for Collins' and Fizzes.

*[Mixing Glass](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/4405916/)* - A spouted glass with or without a stem, mixing glasses are a beautiful way to stir a cocktail. These have been out of vogue for some time, but are coming back into style. They're hardly necessary, though, since you can stir just fine in a pint glass.

**Odds and Ends**

*[Ice Cube Trays](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-Perfect-Cube-Tray-Dark/dp/B000QIU7X6)* - Never underestimate the importance of ice when making cocktails. Not only does ice make your drink cold, but it silently adds the most important ingredient for balancing a cocktail, water. Silicone trays let you make very pretty square cubes, but the ice cubes from your fridge work just as well. [Oversized ice cubes](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-KING-Cube-Trays-Blue/dp/B00395FHRO) are perfect for keeping Old Fashioned style drinks chilly without them getting too watery.

*Juicer* - For a lot of drinks, fresh citrus makes all the difference in the world. But squeezing limes, lemons, and oranges by hand is annoying, messy, wastes juice, and doesn't get any of the oils from the skin out. I prefer a press style juicer. The best I've found for a home bar is an aluminum-built juicer called a ""Wear-Ever"" juicer. You can find it on [Ebay for about $20](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=wear+ever+juicer).

*[Channel Knife](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Lemon-Zester/dp/B00004OCJO)* - Helps you cut those long beautiful twists that make great garnishes for all sorts of drinks.

*Knife and Cutting Board* - For slicing fruit.

*[Vegetable Peeler](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Pro-Y-Peeler/dp/B0000DAQ5E)* - For when you need a peel as garnish. I prefer the Y-peelers, since it's easier to get those nice wide peels that are perfect in a Negroni or Sazerac.

*[Blender](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GQWL7O)* - This can come in handy for making frozen margaritas, strawberry daiquiris, or just crushing ice. Be sure to pick a sturdy model that can handle a lot of ice blending, which tends to wreak havoc on lesser models.

*[Lewis Bag](http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/product-p/oth_lewisbagxx_0000_ckx.htm)* - For the traditionalist, the lewis bag is basically a cloth bag that you fill with ice to crush. If your muddler is robust enough, you can use that for the smashing, or you can go all the way and invest in a [wooden mallet](http://www.amazon.com/Crown-106-Beechwood-Mallet-2-Inch/dp/B002S0OIW6).

*[Ice Crusher](http://www.amazon.com/Waring-IC70-Professional-Stainless-Steel-Large-Capacity/dp/B0009XAHG0)* - Let's be honest, you don't need this for your home bar. You can get by just fine crushing the ice by hand, or buying a smaller hand-cranked ice crusher. But for the bartender who goes through mounds of crushed ice for chilling tropical drinks, this can save you from having an enormous pop-eye arm."	t5_2qpco	True

Currently our menu consists of 2-3 items we have on hand haphazardly mixed into cocktail glasses.  The bartenders are established, silver haired, and never go out for cocktails or to try new liquors.  We recently got in a bottle of Fernet Branca and they all stood around scratching their heads.

I have been working there almost 5 years, starting as a lowly breakfast server and working my way to my current position as brunch bartender on weekends and server/cocktail server during the week.

Now they want me to redesign the menu, update the liquor selection and get us back to current standards of professionalism.  I have met a great deal of resistance from the bartenders.

That said, I have a goal to get to 10 cocktails with one of each base spirit and a few that are classics and a few that are new and exciting.  I also want to make a few brunch cocktails to sell on weekends outside of the tired Bloody Mary and Mimosa.  Heres where I'm at so far:

This week’s cocktail is my monthly foray into the modern world of cocktails, which is filled with all sorts of inventive ingredients, new techniques and creative flavor combinations. As I don’t intend to use my lab equipment for cocktails (yet), with a little more planning, I think I will be able to showcase some very interesting and creative cocktails. This month’s is a little on the simple side, but it does have some great flavors that might ward off some of the bitter cold that many have been experiencing lately. 

**Background**  
As a modern cocktail, there isn’t much background other than the short blurb provided in the *PDT Cocktail Book*. This cocktail was concocted by Nate Dumas in 2007 when he was challenged by a coworker to invent a drink called the Montgomery Smith. The mystery to me lies in where the name Montgomery Smith originated. Was it the name of his coworker? Was it someone they knew? Did the drink reflect after some particular characteristic of the person?   

**Recipe**  
From the *PDT Cocktail Book*  
* 2 oz cognac (I used Remy Martin VSOP)   
* 0.5 oz Bénédictine  
* 0.25 oz Fernet Branca   
Stirred on ice, garnish with lemon peel  

**Results**   
The Montgomery Smith is an interesting blend of fruitiness from the cognac, sweetness from the Bénédictine and bitterness from Fernet Branca. The nuances provided from the herbal sweetness of Bénédictine and the unique flavor profile of Fernet Branca manage to hold each other in check, with the Bénédictine coming through at the front and the Fernet bringing up the rear. I have a hard time balancing cocktails with Fernet Branca’s strong flavors, but this one does it admirably. 
 
**Variations**  
I have considered making this with Laird’s in substitute for the cognac, but haven’t yet had the chance. Exploring the world of cocktails solo can be a challenging endeavor so if anyone else has an opportunity to try it, let me know in the comments.  

**Bénédictine**  
As the most recent liqueur added to my bar, I’ve been finding many excuses to work it into cocktails and thought I’d share more about this ancient liqueur with you all. This post is relatively light on history so suck it up and enjoy. Bénédictine is purported to be an elixir first created by a Bénédictine monk, though given the rather sparse documentation, it is unclear how much of this story is simply a clever marketing tool. Regardless, we are told that the monk Dom Bernardo Vincelli wrote down the recipe for Bénédictine in 1510 and was rediscovered in 1863 by Alexandre Le Grand, a collector of religious art. The monk’s work dealt primarily with different aspects of alchemy, so I guess they are making allusions to Bénédictine being an attempt at the elixir of life.   
The recipe for Bénédictine remains very well guarded as a trade secret, akin to the recipe for Coca-Cola or the blend of spices for KFC chicken, but what is known is that Bénédictine is a blend of 27 herbs and spices on a cognac base and sweetened with honey. It has a very unique flavor profile that is comprised primarily of angelica, providing a sweet celery flavor; hyssop, which has a minty flavor tempered with bitterness and is also used in green chartreuse; and lemon balm, giving citrus flavors with mint undertones. The process of producing Bénédictine is rather complicated for a liqueur, starting with 4 separate distillates that are individually aged for 3 months before being blended together and aged again for 8 months. The final step is to add honey and saffron before heating and aging for a final 4 months.  
Of course such an exceptional product must have the proper terroir for aging, so Alexandre Le Grand had a palace built essentially to house the factory to produce Bénédictine in Fécamp, France. The “Palais” is open for tours and apparently also serves part time as an art gallery.

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully between the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) and this, I’ve given you a solid reason to pick up Bénédictine and add it to your home bar. It’s a really great ingredient and is a very interesting liqueur to experiment with. There are a few more great cocktails using Bénédictine that I will write about in the future, so pick up a bottle now, you won’t regret it.

1336093971.0	t631n	On gin and tonics, and the importance of good tonic.	BarkingLeopard	28	2	33	"The gin and tonic is a great drink for warm weather, so for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere (sorry Aussies), it's time to start thinking about them.  G&amp;Ts are my quintessential ""summer porch drink"", as they are cold (lots of ice, cold tonic), each to make (1 container, no shaking, 2-3 ingredients), and not too strong (can adjust the gin:tonic ratios to suit your tastes).


**Tonic**

I originally discovered good tonic when trying to find smaller bottles for my stronger home-brewed beers (barleywines, RISs, etc), which can be 10%+ in alcohol (with the calories to match), and for which 6oz is an ample serving.  After realizing that empty bottles were $1/bottle, I saw that fancy tonics were only slightly more expensive, and when I tried them, I realized that not only did the small bottles of tonic take standard crown crimp caps, but that the tonic inside was well worth the money.  All of a sudden, I realized that the reason that I had hated G&amp;Ts in the past was because of the cheap tonic, not because of the drink.  Good tonic makes the drink!


Tonic is normally the largest part of your G&amp;T.  Don't go cheap on this; remember that tonic is the vast majority of a good gin and tonic, and thus has a great influence on taste.  Don't buy Seagram's, store brand (shudders), or other such brands.  Go into any decent liquor store, or any larger grocery store, and you should be able to find at least one, hopefully several, brands of ""premium"" tonic.  Read the labels!  If the label says ""corn syrup"", don't buy; you're looking for cane sugar, agave nectar, or something similar.  Likewise, look for cinchona bark or some other specified source of quinine.  FeverTree, Q Tonic, and others are brands to look for; buy a pack of each and experiment.  Seriously, you can find them for $1-2/serving, which is well worth it.  It's worth repeating: **DO NOT** go cheap on tonic.  If you're going to spend money on anything on a G&amp;T, spend it on good tonic, it makes all the difference.  $1-2 for 187mL/6oz of tonic may sound expensive, but again, it makes the drink.  Try buying a 4pk of good tonic (only a $4-7 investment) and tell me otherwise.




**Gin**

You don't need anything fancy for gin.  Feel free to try fancy/premium gins, but with a highball and a lot of tonic, you will have to have a very good palette to taste much of a difference.  If you're going to try to save money on a G&amp;T, here's the place.  Trade down to a middle-shelf  gin or slightly below, and spend the extra buck you saved on tonic.  It's worth it!

I like Seagrams Distiller's Reserve gin for cheap gin, Tanq Rangpur for a good gin for a G&amp;T.  Seagram's Distiller's Reserve isn't great, but it's not the bottom shelf and for a G&amp;T it works and it's 94 proof at $11/5th.  If you want to go more upscale, feel free, but I would argue that anything much over $20/5th (muich better than, say, Tanqueray level of quality) is going to be hard to discern to all but the most discriminating palettes.




**Garnishes and juices**

I like a slice of lime as garnish, which is pretty traditional and looks damn classy on your glass while you sit on the porch IMHO.  Not a huge fan of G&amp;Ts or want to cut down on the bitterness of the tonic?  Juice the rest of the lime straight into the drink.  It makes for a much less bitter and more smoother drink, and helps to hide any inadequacies in your gin.  Also makes for a very refreshing summer drink that goes surprisingly well with a strong cigar.


You can also experiment with adding other liqueurs or juices (Sloe gin + G&amp;T, anyone) to your G&amp;T if you want something a bit sweeter or different.


I may be preaching to the choir here, but hopefully this inspires someone to think a bit more about such a classic drink, and hopefully it converts people who previously hated G&amp;Ts (as I did) to people who can at least tolerate good G&amp;Ts, if not like them."	t5_2qpco	True
1335968442.0	t3ajq	[Cocktail of the Week] Week 10 - Tom Collins	therationalpi	29	5	17	"Any drink that has [glassware named after it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_glass) is worth knowing, and the Tom Collins is no exception. A refreshing combination of lemon juice, simple syrup, and gin, topped with seltzer, the Tom Collins is a refreshing lemonade with kick. The recent resurgence of Old Tom gin has made this classic drink even better.

**History**

The first recipe for the Tom Collins can be found in Jerry Thomas' ""The Bartender's Guide,"" published in 1876. A variation on the Gin Fizz, first published about 15 years earlier, the Tom Collins featured a good deal more lemon juice (though modern day recipes for the [Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/pe8oc/cocktail_of_the_week_week_6_the_gin_fizz/) remove this distinction) and used the sweeter Old Tom Gin.

While the inspiration for the mix was known, the name's source was harder to pin down. A commonly believed myth regards the headwaiter at Limmer's tavern in London, a man named John Collins. This one came with a cute little poem:

&gt;""My name is John Collins, headwaiter at Limmer's,

&gt;Corner of Conduit Street, Hanover Square,

&gt;My chief occupation is filling brimmers

&gt;For all the young gentlemen frequenters there.""

The eponymous cocktail, ""The John Collins,"" was similar to a Tom Collins, using aged genever gin instead of the Old Tom for a decidedly different character. This story was accepted for decades, until a few years ago when it was debunked by a much more likely story.

""The Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874"" is a well documented hoax of exposure. One person would prank his friend by asking ""Have you seen Tom Collins?"" and then proceeding to send them to find this imagined person who was looking for them. It was the 1874 equivalent of ""is your refrigerator running?"" Thus, when the Tom Collins was invented in 1876, it was named after the popular hoax.

Historically, the Tom Collins has gone virtually unchanged, aside from one glaring exception. Old Tom Gin, after which the drink was named, disappeared in the mid 20th century. For decades the Tom Collins was made with London Dry Gin, requiring extra simple syrup to replicate the sweetness. Old Tom Gin earned something of a mythical status, sometimes being referred to as ""The Missing Link."" That is, until Hayman's Old Tom Gin was reintroduced in 2007 based on a recipe from the turn of the century. Since then, even more Old Tom's have resurfaced, making it the go-to spirit for this classic drink yet again.

**Ingredients**

The Tom Collins is essentially a hard sparkling lemonade, with four ingredients.

*2 oz Old Tom Gin*

*3/4 oz Fresh lemon juice*

*3/4 oz Simple syrup*

*5 oz Seltzer*

**Making the Tom Collins**

Add gin, lemon juice, and syrup to a cocktail shaker. Shake with ice until cold. In a Collins glass, add ice and seltzer. Top with the gin and lemon mixture, and garnish with a citrus wedge or cherry.

**Variations**

* The Collins is an entire class of cocktails. A Collins consists of a base spirit, lemon juice, simple syrup, and seltzer served on ice (the ice is considered by some to be the distinction between a Collins and a Fizz). Every base spirit you can think of has its own name.

* 1/2 oz of Maraschino can replace some of the simple syrup for a fresh variation.

* A splash of triple sec can add some complexity to the drink.

* Pureed fruit can be added for a sweet and refreshing variation, at the risk of looking like a TGI Fridays flaretender.

* If you really have to, you can use London Dry Gin instead of Old Tom. Up the portion of simple syrup, if you do this, to maintain the sweetness.

I’m glad that I have this weekly column to write about my home cocktail experiences as it has spurred me to finally finish making my homemade allspice liqueur, aka pimento dram. My intent when making my allspice liqueur was to use it in cocktails around Christmas time as the spicy allspice and cinnamon flavors seem to fit the season, but I just never actually got around to it.  
Instead I figured that it would be clever to feature it for Chinese New Year, which kicked off February 10th, and is traditionally is celebrated for up to 15 days following. Given the traditional lion dance associated with Chinese New Year festivities, the Lion’s Tail cocktail seemed like an well-named cocktail for this week.  

**Background**  
The Lion’s Tail originates from the 1930s, first documented in the very rare Café Royal Cocktail Book compiled by William J. Tarling and published in 1937. It has remained in relative obscurity until more recently when it was published in Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails by Ted Haigh. In any case, it is a very unique cocktail, featuring pimento dram aka allspice liqueur, which I will discuss in more depth below. The name of this cocktail likely stems from a reference to “twisting the Lion’s tail”, serving as a warning during the era of British colonialism to avoid causing trouble lest the Lion (Britain) come roaring down on you. The combination of ingredients from former British colonies such as Jamaica (rum/lime/allspice) and America (bourbon whiskey), might be a playful jab befitting this cocktails name.  

**Recipe**  
* 2 oz bourbon  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.5 oz fresh lime juice  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 0.25-0.5 oz 1:1 simple syrup to taste  
Shaken on ice, no garnish  

My best recipe using homemade allspice dram (your results may vary)  
* 2.5 oz Elijah Craig 12  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz simple syrup 1:1  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Shaken on ice, no garnish  
See my photo [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/18wlwm/ncotw_7_preview/).  
Note: similar to my recipe for a Manhattan, this is probably closer to having two normal cocktails since I appreciate a generous pour and this was the best tasting version I managed. You have been warned.

**Results**  
This is a very interesting cocktail, but you may find your results will vary depending on how sweet your pimento dram is. I do not own a bottle of St. Elizabeth pimento dram, so I unfortunately cannot comment on how that compares to my homemade version. The combination of bourbon and lime is generally rare, but given that the base of pimento dram is white rum, it somehow manages to pull the flavors together. This cocktail is at first very clearly a sour, the lime being the first flavor to hit your mouth. Bourbon provides a strong backbone to carry the cocktail into its unique bitter and spicy flavor comprised of the Angostura bitters mixing with the additional allspice and potentially cinnamon of the pimento dram. Ultimately I experience a rather lingering finish reminiscent of the flavors you have after sipping on some hot apple cider or mulled wine.  

**Pimento Dram and DIY**  
Pimento dram is a liqueur made by infusing white rum with allspice berries and is most commonly featured in tropical tiki style drinks. Allspice is the dried unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica tree, native to the Caribbean region and one of the most important flavors in cuisine from that region. Natively known as pimenta, English colonists decided to call it allspice as its flavor reminded them of a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Perhaps in respect to its origins, allspice liqueur is commonly referred to as pimento dram, though it runs the risk of being confused with the pimento cherry pepper used in pimento stuffed olives. Perhaps we should start referring to it as pimenta dram instead?  
As I mentioned in the beginning of this article, I thought it would be fun to make my own pimento dram. There are a couple recipes that are floating around the internet, [this](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/pimento-dram/) one by Kaiser Penguin to be well regarded, but I went with this [post]( http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/diy-allspice-dram-make-your-own-st-elizabeths-pimento-dram-recipe.html) from Serious Drinks as it was my original introduction to this ingredient and served as my inspiration to making it.  The Serious Drinks recipe makes about 3 cups of pimento dram, which seemed excessive to me, so I scaled it down and my recipe for a smaller volume, approx. 4 oz total, is below:  
* 4 oz light rum (I used Flor de Cana Extra Dry, but traditionally should be Wray &amp; Nephew)  
* 2 tbsp whole allspice berries  
* 1/4 cinnamon stick  
Crush allspice berries (I didn’t have a mortar and pestle but found that my mixing glass and muddler were more than up to the task) and infuse in the rum for 4 days shaking it once daily. On day 5, crush up the cinnamon stick and add to your infusion before letting it sit for 7 additional days still shaking it once daily. After a total time of 12 days, strain out all the solids using a mesh strainer, then follow it up by straining it through a coffee filter. At this point, I found that a significant amount of the original rum basically was soaked up in the allspice berries so despite starting with 4 oz of rum, my final infused product was only approximately 2 oz. I also ended up halting my project at this point for about 2 months, which may help mellow out the flavors, but I did finish it earlier this month by adding an equal volume of brown sugar syrup, made by dissolving an equal volume of brown sugar in water. I ended up with a small jar of pimento dram, which is very strongly spiced and not really something I would have alone. At some point I will hopefully have a chance to encounter a bottle of the more commonly used St. Elizabeth or Wray &amp; Nephew pimento dram, which I imagine are sweeter than my attempt. 

**Cheers!**  
If you have a bottle of pimento dram, shake up this cocktail and enjoy. For everybody else, consider making your own pimento dram, it is really rather simple and is worth giving a shot. I know this ingredient is definitely not found in most home bars, so next week’s post will be something simpler. Hope you enjoyed this week’s column, let me know how your Lion’s Tail went or your favorite cocktails using pimento dram in the comments below.

1334448128.0	sa5gi	Homemade Lime Cordial - Never Use Rose's in Gimlets Again	CocktailChemist	28	2	6	"As we head into spring, it's going to be time for warmer weather cocktails again. Break out that bottle of gin that's been hiding in favor of richer spirits. And what better drink to make than a gimlet? But if you're going to make a proper gimlet, that calls for lime cordial. What's that? The nasty, HFCS-ladden monstrosity of Rose's Lime Cordial found on every liquor store shelf? Perish the thought.

Lime cordial began in the 19th century as a way for sailors to preserve lime juice that could be consumed on long voyages to hold off scurvy. In essence it was simply a mixture of lime juice, sugar and lime peels simmered briefly to make a syrup. It's relatively easy to make and adds a new dimension to a number of different classic and tiki cocktails. This recipe comes from Imbibe magazine's ""Mix It Up"" feature in their Jan/Feb 2011 issue.

**Lime Cordial**

* 6 limes (enough for 1/2 cup of juice)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar

Zest the limes and save the peels. Don't worry about getting some of the bitter pith as it will actually perk up the resulting syrup a bit. Juice the zested limes and strain the juice into a saucepan. Add sugar and simmer for ~20 minutes. Let the syrup cool for 5 minutes, then add the lime peels and steep for 15-20 minutes. Strain the syrup through a mesh strainer into a clean container and store in the refrigerator. The cordial should keep for several months.

While a gimlet is the classic use for lime cordial, there are a number of other recipes that call for it, from the tiki-style [Suffering, Dying and Dead Bastards](http://www.cocktailmusings.com/2010/05/suffering-bastard.html), to classic drinks from the [Cocktail Database](http://www.cocktaildb.com/), including this little number:

**[Limey Cocktail](http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/04/homemade-lime-cordial.html)**

* 1 oz light rum
* 0.75 oz lime cordial
* 0.5 oz orange liqueur
* 0.25 oz lime juice

Combine all ingredients, shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

While this drink calls for light rum, I decided to tweak it a bit by using the rather potent 100-proof rhum agricole blanc from La Favorite.

The nose is dominated by the vegetal funk of the rhum agricole, backed up by a bit of lime oil from the cordial. The initial sip is rather syrupy with hints of the orange liqueur, making it seem like the drink is going to be overpoweringly sweet. However, this quickly transitions to snappy lime juice and the alcoholic bite and funky pear flavors of the rhum. There's a bit of lingering bitter sweetness from a combination of the rhum and syrups, making it interestingly more-ish.

Do you stick with the same classic cocktail every time?  Do you always go with variations of the same?  Or do you base it on the venue.

Personally, I know my drink order varies wildly based on where I am.

Dive bars - G&amp;T, hard to screw up, so it's safe.

Restaurants - Honestly, I usually pick what's weirdest to me on the drink menu.  Typically, the stranger the flavor combo and ingredients, the more time I assume went into coming up with the idea.  I want to try what they took the time to experiment with.  Though often you wind up with sugary messes.

Typical Cocktail bars - Here I usually look for a bar-specific twist on something classic.  I trust they'll get the basic drink right, and I'm always interested in what twist they can throw in.

Home - THIS is where I'm sipping the real classics.  I know I can make a martini the way I want it.  I don't want to explain to bartender how I like it, and I don't want them to mess with what I know is my blend of a classic.

I've been trying all of the more ""classic"" cocktails and decided to try and make a Negroni. Looking at different recipes I went with what seems to be the normal 1 part gin, 1 part campari and 1 part sweet vermouth. The thing had such a bitter finish that I couldn't even drink it. I tried again using double the gin and half the campari and again it's really bad.

Is this normal for a Negroni or am I doing something wrong? For ingredients I tried it with two types of gin, my normal standby Bombay Sapphire and then a small batch called Death's Door that tastes pretty good. Used standard (I think) Campari and Gallo sweet vermouth. I've never had campari before, so I'm wondering if it's me or the booze. Thanks!

edit: Wow! 4 answers in 20 minutes. You guys like your drinks! I'll try and find some Aperol and give it a shot. This is one area where I don't mind the trial and error too much. Thanks again!

I'm talking about a simple tequila-lime juice-triple sec margarita. Of course, every drink is made a little differently depending on who makes it, but this drink is so popular, and my guests are so likely to ask for one, that I'd like to hear how other people on here make one.

I usually use 2 oz of tequila, 1 oz of triple sec, and the juice of one lime (which comes out to about an ounce). If it's someone who I know would probably like a sweeter drink, I'll add maybe a quarter ounce of simple syrup, or increase the triple sec a little bit. I usually take mine over ice in an old-fashioned glass, but I'll also serve them up in a margarita glass if someone asks for that.

Of course, this recipe brings out the tequila taste a lot more than some other recipes, which I think is great, but isn't necessarily everyone's thing.

Anyway, what proportions do you all recommend? How do you go about making a margarita? Do you include anything special, or do you keep it the the three basic ingredients? Would you make one differently for a guest than if you were making one for yourself?

1353265263.0	13ep6o	A guide to Thanksgiving drinks	therationalpi	25	2	14	"Thanksgiving is the essential fall holiday. Everything is decorated in browns, golds, and reds, and the smell of fresh food is in the air. I'm sure many of us here are the people our friends and family turn to when they want a suggestion for a drink, so I'm here to give a quick guide on what to make to accent this wonderful holiday.

**The Flavors**

If you want a fall cocktail, you need to focus on fall flavors. These are the flavors I consider to be iconically fall: *maple, pumpkin, nutmeg, apple, cinnamon, hazelnut, nuts, rosemary, sage, caramel, fig, wine, cranberry.* I'm sure there are more, but this is what jumped to mind for me. Note that a lot of those are ""Warm"" flavors and spices, with the only real verdant flavors being rosemary and sage. As a result, the aesthetic of a good fall cocktail is generally richness and warmth, as opposed to the crispness you look for in a summer cocktail. Citrus tends to take a backseat in fall cocktails, although the fragrance of orange peel still makes a great accent.

**The Strength**

In my opinion, fall is the time to put away your clear liquor in favor of something darker. *Whiskey, brandy, and calvados (applejack)* all match well with the season, and happen to blend well with the flavors I mentioned before.

**Liqueurs of choice**

Here are a few mixers to consider when making fall cocktails:

*Frangelico* - Brings a rich hazelnut flavor to any drink.

*Amaretto* - The sweet almond flavor really matches the season well.

*Goldschlager (or other cinnamon spirit)* - Not to be overused, gives a cinnamon bite to any cocktail.

*Creme de Cassis* - Blackcurrant is passingly similar to cranberries, and fit well in fall drinks.

*Sloe Gin* - Similarly, the rough flavor of sloe could offer a layer of complexity.

*Creme de Violette* - A floral flavor that somehow doesn't intrude of the sense of season, creme de violette can be used for a lighter fall concoction, as can it's little brother creme yvette.

*Grand Marnier* - The bitter orange tempered with rich brandy makes this more than appropriate for the season.

*Averna* - Potentially...I can't speak personally for it, since I've never had it by itself.

1/2 ounce pineapple juice

1 ounce bourbon

3-5 curshed basil leaves

Shake over ice, strain, garnish with basil or lemon.

It's tart, tangy, a little sweet, smooth, and just a hint of spicey/floral from the basil.  Great for sipping on a summer afternoon.

Feedback?  Ideas?

My own thoughts:

Might be a little too lemony.  I am playing around with the proportions of lemon and pineapple.  I think that too much pineapple clashes with bourbon a little, and I use it primarily as a sweetener with a little bit of character.  I am going to try to throw some agave nectar or simple syrup in there to cut the lemon sourness a little.

Does anyone have any experience infusing bourbon with basil?  I think that it would be a good way to bring the basil out a little, but I don't want to ruin any bourbon."	t5_2qpco	True

However, I'm getting tired of making nothing but Tom Collins and Gin/tonics.  I KNOW there are lots of gin cocktails out there, but I don't know which ones to make.  I want to primarily learn ""classic"" cocktails but a few ridiculous/fun drinks wouldn't be frowned on.  I also would love to learn what other liquors gin mixes well with.

My currently preferred tom collins:  

* 2oz gin (depending on my mood it'll be really dry or a more floral one)  

* 1oz lemon juice  

* 1/2oz rich simple syrup  

* top with club soda  

* If I'm feeling frisky, I'll also add in 1/2oz liqueur of some sort.  Sometimes Maraschino, peach schnapps, st germain, or whatever I happen to have.  Punches it up a bit.

* garnish with lemon or cucumber slice depending on how hot it is outside.

Also also, for myself I like the booze forward drinks, but when I'm mixing for friends they very much prefer sweeter drinks.  Think daiquiri or a sweet margarita.  All of them claim to hate gin, but I've won a few of them over with the above tom collins.

1366455347.0	1cqhty	Lime Cordial (x-post from /r/Cooking)	SparklingLimeade	24	2	3	"A while ago I found a recipe for lime cordial so I could make a proper gimlet. Now I make several large batches of cordial every summer and drink it with soda water in addition to in cocktails. The other night I was halfway through and began thinking about the process more than usual. Afterward spent the night researching deeper and came up with some interesting recipes and even theorycrafting. I found the results interesting enough to share and I still have some unfinished thoughts and unanswered questions as well.

At the end of the night my conclusions and questions are

* What makes lime cordial different from the juice and syrup that's improperly substituted in some cases is that cordial has juice, sugar, zest, and time instead of just sugar and juice.

* Heat is used primarily to make sugar dissolve better

* Heat causes citric acid to break down. (What else does it change? Is the overall effect positive? Does added citric acid improve the flavor afterward?)

* Added water helps the sugar dissolve as well. (Does water have ANY beneficial effect in the finished product? My cordial with water is still pretty strong so maybe it helps with portioning.)

* The zest's essence is extracted by the acids of the juice mixture, heat is not necessary. (does it help the results at all? Articles indicate 'no.')

* Added acids were originally for preservative properties. (Should they still be added for flavor?)

* How much zest should be used? Is there a reason to use less or should I just make use of the limes I slay and put it all in?


**end recipe for small batch** (very close to about.com recipe)

2 cups boiling water

1 cup sugar

6 limes (4 zested)

.5 tsp tartaric acid, .75 tsp citric acid

Dissolve sugar and acid in water, add lime juice and zest in a non-reactive container and leave overnight. Strain into a container for storage and leave in fridge, preferably another day before use.


**Alternative recipe** (untested, directly from links below)

equal parts lime juice and sugar

zest of all limes

Stir lime juice and sugar without heat till dissolved. Add zest in a non-reactive container and refrigerate overnight. Strain into a container for storage and leave in fridge, preferably another day before use.

Considering the price of drinks, as well as the well-stocked bar (they at least had Pernod), I thought it'd be OK to order a Sazerac. I basically got an Old Fashioned (no absinthe/anise wash). Still drank it, resisted mightily to order an Old Fashioned afterward to see what they would do.

1359136541.0	179l6z	On my way to Las Vegas tomorrow night...6hrs....Any suggestions?  [UPDATE]	phuckdub	24	3	11	"Hey everyone.  So I was on my way to Brazil (many, many, many caipirinhas--and wow do they make them strong and sweet there...you can get them made right on the street out of a styrofoam cooler for about .75 if you are in the right (wrong?) part of town!) and I had a 6hr layover in Vegas starting at 10:15pm.  I asked for advice, and wanted to report back.  

I went first to the Vesper.  Roger &amp; Roger were working, and it was not what I expected when I walked up.  The whole bar was glitz, and there were dozens of people coming up to the bar shouting things like:

Hey boss!  Two Coronas!
Yo! Bud! Can I get a Gin &amp; Tonic?
Cheif! three bud limes! 

I pondered the list, which looked good, and told the bartender that I had heard that this was a good place to get a cocktail.  He grinned, and I got his attention for the rest of the evening.  He made me a fantastic manhattan variation with some Amaro Nonnino, and a great crusta, but I forget the specifics.  I got to try craft spirits from the area, that we can't get in Toronto, and he sent me to another bar, Herbs &amp; Rye, which seems like a local cocktail bar, as it was about 15 minutes away by taxi, and the driver hadn't heard of it. 

Herbs &amp; Rye's ambiance was more my speed, with an eager bartender mixing me up classics.  One of the Rogers from the Vesper joined me as he got off work, and we chatted about cocktails, the industry (I'm in it in Toronto), and various cocktail things.  I had two cocktails and a beer....I forget the first, but the second was a very good Blood &amp; Sand, and I stumbled out to get some Tacos Carnitas (hard to get good ones in Toronto), and to the airport to be drunkenly patted down after refusing the weird scanner thing...glad I got on my flight! 

Anyhow, I can recommend the cocktails in both of these places, and the fine Barmen who served me (sorry, I forget the name of the young man at H&amp;R).  

Glad I avoided the bullshit of vegas at the second bar, but there you go!

For this week’s post, I thought I’d write about a classic cocktail that first introduced me to the joys of Campari, the Boulevardier. If you’re still stuck in the throes of winter and are looking for other appropriate classic cocktails to warm up with, check out my previous posts on the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) or the [Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/).   

**Background**  
The creation of the Boulevardier was documented in 1927 by Harry McElhone at Harry’s New York Bar, which was located in Paris (how confusing). As with much of cocktail history, the origins of this cocktail was a result of Prohibition. Harry McElhone was originally a bartender at the Plaza Hotel in New York, but when Prohibition was enacted, the obvious difficulties spurred him to move to Europe where he encountered a wide range of new ingredients such as the bitter Italian apéritif Campari. Straddling the line between American whiskey and Italian Campari, he came up with the Boulevardier cocktail, named after the literary magazine helmed by Erskine Gwynne.  
At first glance, you would think this is a derivative of the Negroni (comprised of equal parts dry gin, sweet vermouth and Campari), with the Boulevardier substituting bourbon whiskey in place of the dry gin. However, it turns out that Boulevardier predates the Negroni by nearly 20 years, as the Negroni was never documented until 1947 despite its purported origins in the 1920s. Maybe Count Camillo Negroni just couldn’t be bothered to write his variation on the Americano down anywhere. Either way, this is a delicious use of Campari and an underappreciated classic cocktail today.  

**Recipes**  
*Barflies and Cocktails* by Harry McElhone circa 1927  
* 1/3 Campari  
* 1/3 Italian vermouth  
* 1/3 Bourbon whisky  
“*Now is the time for all good barflies to come to the aid of the party, since Erskinne Gwynne crashed in with his Boulevardier Cocktail*”  

*[Imbibe](http://www.imbibemagazine.com/The-Boulevardier-Cocktail-Recipe)*  
* 1.5 oz bourbon  
* 1.0 oz Campari  
* 1.0 oz sweet vermouth  
Stirred on ice, garnish with choice of orange slice, lemon twist or cherry  
I made this recipe seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17yl4t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_preview/)  

 *[New York Times](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/case-study-the-boulevardier/)*  
* 2.0 oz bourbon or rye  
* 1.0 oz Campari  
* 1.0 oz sweet vermouth  
Stirred on ice, garnish lemon twist  

**Results**  
This is another cocktail I don’t make often enough. It’s quite delicious, a cousin to the Manhattan, but relying on Campari to provide its unique bitter profile in place of Angostura. In addition to the beautiful red hue Campari imparts to the cocktail, as a liqueur, it results in a sweeter cocktail and a much longer bitter finish. The initial flavor is briefly somewhere between a Manhattan and an Old-Fashioned but matures immediately into the unique citrusy bitterness of Campari.  
 
**Variations**  
As can be seen from the recipes, the modern interpretation of the Boulevardier takes a more spirit-forward approach compared to the sweeter initial incarnation. The substitution of rye for bourbon gives a much more flavorful and robust cocktail tempering the sweetness of Campari while not losing its bitter profile. The Campari in this cocktail can also be substituted or combined with other bitter amari, as mentioned in the article by the New York Times above.   
Usage of different sweet vermouth also can change this cocktail quite a bit, Jeffrey Morgenthaler refers the flavor of Campari + Carpano Antica as “[Tootsie Roll](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/summer-in-a-bottle-americano-soda/)” (PS the Americano is a great summer cocktail), but I haven’t yet had a chance to restock Carpano and only have Dolin Rouge for now. A significant twist on the Boulevardier is to use dry vermouth in place of the sweet vermouth resulting in a cocktail known as the Old Pal (also aptly pointed out by user SoMuchMoreEagle). As suggested by user [Mushead](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17yl4t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_preview/c89zmme) in the comments of my preview post, a dry sherry may also be used in substitution of the sweet vermouth. I am not familiar with working with sherry, so how this would change the cocktail, I’m not yet sure, but I am definitely intrigued by the idea.  

**Campari**  
For the section where I try to feature a particularly interesting aspect of this week’s cocktail, I thought I would take this as an opportunity to learn a little more about Campari and share it. Campari was first invented all the way back in 1860 by a fellow known as Gaspare Campari. Its blend of herbs, aromatic plants, and fruit, are unsurprisingly a trade secret, known only a handful of people. It has been reported to have anywhere from 20 to 60 ingredients, but its main flavor notes are quinine, rhubarb, ginseng and orange peel, which give it a very bracing and unique bitterness. Personally, if I were to try and describe it to somebody else, I would have to say it is an awful lot like cough syrup, but somehow delicious.  
Over the last century, Campari has continued to thrive, through appealing and aggressive marketing. The history of Campari ads, as can be seen [here](http://www.campari.com/int/en/campari-world/history/), is really quite interesting as you can see as their ads reflect both the art and historical events of the time. In the 1890s, Campari started a calendar featuring artwork from the artist Cesare Tallone, who painted a beautiful woman representing the essence of Campari. Over the next 100 years, many artists contributed to advertising the Campari brand, often playing on the red color and perpetually cultivating the image that Campari is modern. The Campari calendar has recently featured alluring women such as Eva Mendes, Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba (note to self: find these calendars).   
Almost 150 years after the invention of Campari, in 2006 its most striking feature, the deep red color, became a topic for discussion in the cocktail scene. Originally, the redness of Campari was due to carmine, which is derived from crushed cochineal beetles. Yes, one of the original ingredients in Campari could be considered beetle juice. However, between arguments over having to slap an “insect-derived” label on things using carmine and the sharp rise in our modern hypersensitive population becoming allergic to everything under the sun, Campari switched to an artificial plant-based dye. Unfortunately this may have coincided with a modification in its recipe, as I have come across a [report](http://drinkmemag.com/2010/07/hard-times-for-the-hard-shelled/) that the “old Campari” was less sweet and more complex. So if you have an old bottle of Campari, maybe go buy a new bottle and do a side-by-side tasting. I’d love to hear your experience!  

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s post, let me know how you like your own Boulevardier (though many of you already have in my accompanying preview post), and if you don’t own a bottle of Campari, I hope this post will spur you to get one. Pick one up on your way home or for this weekend. It’s worth it and there will definitely be more cocktails with it in your future as it finds its place in my cocktails around the year."	t5_2qpco	True

The origins of the Martini are unclear, but it started appearing in bartending guides in the late 1800's.  Some say that the drink originated in San Francisco from the drink Martinez, people from the island Martinez (near San Fran) argue a bartender from there invented it, while others argue that the drink originated at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912. (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini_%28cocktail%29#Martini_origins_and_mixology)).

Either way, the drink become popular during the prohibition era due to the prevalence of bath tub gin.  Following prohibition, the drink continued to grow in popularity.  Originally, the drink had a 1-1 ratio of gin to vermouth.  Following prohibition, the martini become increasing drier, where the ration of gin to vermouth was generally served 3-1 or 5-1.  As a rule, the drier your martini, the more gin you use.  

Note:  The proportions were initially designed to be for 80 proof gins.  If using a higher proofed gin, be sure to keep that in mind when mixing to keep the taste/drunkiness levels where you want them.

**Ingredients**

 * Gin
 * Dry Vermouth
 * Olive (Optional)

**Instructions**

 * Chill a glass with ice (fill with cold water to help chill the glass)
 * In a shaker, add ice ([cracking the ice](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/05/cocktail-101-how-to-crack-ice-for-a-drink.html) helps, don't use crushed ice or it might get too watered down.  Cracking the ice helps to dilute and chill the drink without doing too much of either.)
 * Pour in the gin (depending on how dry you want it, add that much gin  1.5 oz is standard) 
 * Pour in the dry vermouth (.5 oz is standard)
 * Stir briskly until the glass is very cold 
 * Pour out the water / ice from your chilling glass
 * Strain the drink from the shaker
 * Garnish with an olive (optional, although the olive is normally expected)

**Variations**

There are almost too many to list.  Virtually every bar with a cocktail list seems to have a special house martini that someone dreamed up.

A Sweet martini involves replacing the dry vermouth with sweet vermouth.  

A medium martini uses half dry and sweet vermouth.  

A gibson involves replacing the olive with a lemon peel and pearl onions.  This can also be made with vodka instead of gin. 

A vodka martini replaces the gin with vodka.

An extra dry martini (8-1 ratio) uses 2 oz dry gin and .25 oz dry vermouth.  

A tequini replaces with gin with tequila and uses either a lemon or lime peel as garnish.

* Way too sweet. Which on its own might be salvageable, but...

* how to reliably make clear ice (and why)
* how to make a cheaper gomme syrup

1. I was always taught a Manhattan is garnished with 2 cherries out of respect for 9/11 and never heard of using a twist in a perfect Manhattan, how wrong am i?

2. We struggle to find a decent rye whiskey, so more often than not a Manhattan is made with Woodford, or Makers Mark.. Would this be frowned upon in the US?

3. How much weight do you put on the vermouth in a manhattan? Most bars over here only have martini and rosso, although a few will use Punt E Mes?

Would also be interested to know any other facts or interesting points about the drink, it's widely believed that Winston Churchills mother was drinking Manhattans the night he was conceived, although ive also read that this is bullshit.

1355091189.0	14kgfd	A newly imported cinchona aperitif: Kina l'Avion d'Or	PleasurePositive	17	0	10	"I sat down in Austin's East Side Show Room and ordered one my usuals, the Vesper Matini from Ian Fleming's James Bond lore. To replace the out-of-production Kina Lillet, I'll opt for Cocci Americano to cut the booze. [Cocci Americano](http://www.cocchi.it/eng/americano.htm) is an Italian white wine aperitif spiced with citrus and an herb blend that supposedly includes quinine-laden cinchona bark in addition to gentian and the usual bitter suspects. It's considered by some as the most accessible taste analogue to the late Kina Lillet.

This time however the bartender smiles and tells me they've got something new for me to try. He reaches below the bar and pulls out a colorfully vintage-labelled bottle of absinthe-colored liquid and explains to me that this is the new best thing to hit the States in aperitifs. He claims it's an even closer match to the late Kina Lillet of the Vesper Martini and Corpse Reviver #2 and that I'll love it.

I can tell a difference immediately as I whiff the top of my glass. The earthy bark taste and quinine really stand out. I sip it and love it.

This new aperitif was Kina l'Avion d'Or, made by Matter-Luginbühl in Switzerland. [Their website](http://www.erlebnisbrennerei.ch/index.asp?shopaction=Product&amp;ID=26891) claims (in German) that the wine is Cortese and the components include cinchona bark, orange peel, and wormwood. It's apparently been around a bit, but only this spring, started being imported into the U.S.A. by [Tempus Fugit Spirits](http://www.tempusfugitspirits.com/).

I'll say that it's much more flavorful than Cocci Americano and the next time I ordered, I requested a tad less so I could still taste the juniper from the london dry gin. It's almost a bit too flavorful to have on its own... for a stand-alone apertif at dessert, I think I'd still prefer Cocci Americano or even Lillet Blanc."	t5_2qpco	True

Currently, Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails has 370 recipes from pre-Prohibition to the past decade.  Moving through this guide should be an interesting opportunity to compare recipes and consider how they have changed over time.  Harry presents, for the most part, just straight recipes. No fancy anecdotes. Few histories. Some vagueness in ingredient names.  It's just a straightforward course in booze and putting more booze with that booze.

Just a few rules I'm giving myself here:

* If it says shake, you shake! Even if stirring is your instinct, you shake!
* If the ingredient does not exist anymore or is unavailable in the US, you fake it.
* No garnish named? Keep it naked.
* The more old fashioned (or European) in ingredient you can get, the better.

And now... the [Trinity](http://imgur.com/a/lzaN0#.T5i-rnmg9hs.link).
Actually this is really two cocktails with one go.  This is also listed separately in the book as ""The Perfect cocktail"".  The recipes are identical so perhaps this was an oversight or a deliberate move to recognize two names for the same cocktail.

It calls for equal parts gin, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth.  Anyone who has navigated cocktail culture for even a short time will also recognize that these are the ingredients for a *perfect* martini (Ah! Now I see the connection!).  The proportions for a modern perfect martini are more gin heavy of course, so I would suppose we have something like a *very wet* perfect martini.

The link above charts the mixing itself. So we can pass on that for the text, but just a word on the bottles.

For my gin, I'm using Citadelle.  I've been a fan of this one for awhile. It mixes well, costs less than $24, meets the European preference, and doesn't drown a drink in juniper.

For the dry vermouth, Dolin dry.  I think this might be one of the best vermouths on the market.  Some vermouths just don't taste like wine.  Dolin is different.  It's almost something you could sip on its own.

For the sweet, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino.  I've touted it's usefulness in other comments and I'll do so again.  Cocchi Torino cost me about $19 (compared to the $33 Carpano would run me).  It's flavor profile is almost identical to Carpano Antica, with maybe just a slight reduction in spiciness.

Now about the cocktail:
The gin is the Father. The dry is the Holy Spirit. The sweet is the Son.  That's because the sweet vermouth dominates this drink.  It's no wonder the perfect martini ends up paring the vermouth down.  The Trinity/Perfect cocktail is sweet forward, dry on the finish, and gin on the.... well... the gin gets lost.

That being said, I did enjoy this cocktail.  It's one of those drinks that is simple enough to get made for you at even one of the lowliest of places.  A small hotel bar should carry each of the ingredients for example.  Now, well gin + Martini &amp; Rossi dry + Martini &amp; Rossi sweet would probably lack the smoothness found in the higher quality stuff, but it would get the job done.  In fact, the sweet M&amp;R would hide any blemishes in the bad gin.  Not a bad prospect if that's all you have available.

1327684042.0	ozb9f	Invent a drink based on a Redditor's handle	mwilke	19	2	22	"So I made an [offhanded comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/owi01/some_people_just_dont_give_a_fuck_in_which_i_am/c3ktx6w) recently about how a Redditor's name was so cool I was going to name a drink after her, and she responded, and I figured I should probably really do it!

With no further ado, I present the **Masturbanana**:

* 3 parts vodka
* 2.5 parts homemade banana syrup (see below)
* Good port wine
* Banana slice garnish (see below)

The banana syrup is easy to make and is a nice alternative to the Runts-esque hyper-banana flavors like you get in 99 bananas or cream of banana. 

Simply put 1 cup of sugar, 1.5c water, the peel of a whole banana (wash it first!), and the banana itself (reserve a few thick slices for garnish), broken into a few big chunks, in a pot. Bring it to a boil and keep it there until you can't see any individual sugar granules, then reduce it to a low simmer and stir it for about three minutes. You don't want it to darken at all, but the syrup should have a strong banana flavor when you're done. The final product should be lightly straw-colored.

Strain the sryup through a mesh strainer, and then strain it again through a cloth (I used a clean dishcloth because I was out of cheesecloth, and it worked perfectly). Put it in a jar and leave it uncapped on the counter until it cools down a bit, and then refrigerate it. It should keep for a few weeks, at least, but don't quote me on that.

While you're making the syrup, dip the reserved banana slices in sugar and place them on a hot pan. Once the first side is caramelized, turn it over and do the other side - shouldn't take more than a couple minutes.

Fill a short glass (I used a cafe-style juice glass) with ice. Add the vodka and the banana syrup and stir to combine. Float a little bit of port wine on top - just enough to give it a thin later of pretty color. Place on of your caramelized banana slices on the edge and drink!

The flavor is warm and toasty, like banana bread with raisins.

I thought it would either be delicious or terribly disgusting but I was extremely surprised by just how tasty it was. Please try it and let me know what you think. I am also looking for a clever name for it.

**Ingredients**

* 2 oz duck fat washed bourbon (recipe to follow)
* .5-.75 oz sweet vermouth
* A few dashes of Angostura bitters
* 1/2 of a sprig of rosemary

**Directions**

Combine all ingredients in a cup with ice and stir well. Pour over one large ice cube (I use [these](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-KING-Cube-Trays-Blue/dp/B00395FHRO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330303336&amp;sr=8-1)) and garnish with the rosemary sprig


**Duck Fat Washed Bourbon**

* 4 tbsp Rendered Duck Fat (look at your local gourmet market)
* 1 750 ml bottle any good bourbon/rye (I used Makers Mark)
* Wide mouthed jar large enough to fit the bourbon and have some room on top
* Cheese cloth (optional but recommended)

Heat up the duck fat in a saucepan until it is liquid, place in a wide mouthed jar that is large enough to fit the bourbon/rye, pour the bourbon/rye over top and shake it up. Let it sit at room temperature for two hours, shaking every 30 minutes. Place in freezer for 2+ hours until the fat has solidified on top. Remove from freezer, scoop fat off of the top, pour into another container using a strainer lined with cheese cloth, alternating where you pour so it catches all of the fat. When you are done ""filtering"" it, pour it back into the original (empty) bottle and use. 

Notes: It tastes like a thanksgiving dinner in a glass, the bourbon really gets a lot of the duck flavor and the rosemary gives the drink a nice finish. I wasn't sure how the bourbon would turn out so I only did a quarter of a fifth and poured it in a clean jar but it was all gone in a little over an hour. The fat washing process totally transforms the bourbon into a rich silky drink. I am really looking forward to making this again. "	t5_2qpco	True
1329886076.0	q0h9f	[Cocktail of the Week] Week 8 - The Gimlet	sedukai	20	3	12	"j_alt asked me to do this week's cocktail, so I thought I'd choose the gimlet because it is one that is simple and delicious in it's purest form, but is also a great starting point for creating unique and tasty variations of your own (also see ""Variations"" below). It's a drink that is potent, but not too strong, sweet with a satisfying sour bite, and uncomplicated to make.


**History**

There are two possible derivations of the name, both of which are plausible, but neither definite. The first is that the drink is named after the British naval surgeon, Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette, who introduced this drink as a means of inducing his messmates to take lime juice as an anti-scurvy medication in the late 1800's (a disease caused by a Vitamin D deficiency). The medication had been lemons until English lime growers lobbied to replace it with limes, which didn't end up having the best effect because limes have about 1/4 of the anti-scurvy properties of lemons. Plenty of scurvy ensued. 

The next possible derivation hails from the fact that a 'gimlet' is a corkscrew-like device used for making holes in barrels to get to its contents. The British Royal Navy, it is said, distributed these to the fleet along with barrels of lime juice. (From *Enjoy a Gimlet by Joshua E London* and *The Joy of Mixology by Gary Regan*)

**Ingredients**

* 2 oz Gin (or Vodka, if you prefer)
* 1 oz Lime Juice
* .5 oz Simple Syrup
* Garnish with a slice of lime

Essentially this is a gin sour. The measurements are not exact by any means. Too sour? .5 to .75 oz lime juice is good. Too sweet? .25 oz would work just fine. 1 oz of lime juice is usually just 1 full lime, give or take. 

A lot of recipes will call for Rose's Lime juice. If that is all you've got, you can use .5 to 1 oz of it (to taste) instead of simple and lime. When you can though, use fresh juices (in all of your cocktails!) and you'll be able to taste the difference. 

**Directions**

Combine the ingredients and shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coup or martini glass and garnish. This drink can also be served over ice in an old fashioned glass if you prefer.

And that's it! By itself, the gin gimlet is very refreshing and delicious and, because the ingredients are so simple, it's not hard to add varying tastes and textures to make it different.

**Variations**

*[Bourbon &amp; Branch](http://www.bourbonandbranch.com/)'s Cucumber Gimlet*

* 1 ¾ oz. Cucumber-Infused gin*

* ¾ oz. Lime Juice
 
* ¼ oz. Elderflower syrup
 
* 1 dash Orange bitters
 
* Float of Champagne


In an ice filled mixing glass, combine ingredients [except Champagne]. Shake and strain into cocktail or Martini glass. Add float of Champagne and garnish with three cucumber slices.

*Cucumber Gin

* 1 Cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks

* Zest of 1 lemon or orange

* 1 750-ml. bottle unflavored gin

Combine the cucumber, zest and gin in sterile glass jar; let stand for 48 hours before serving.

Tip: Tastes great without the spirits being infused too, if you don't have it or don't want to make it.


*[Rye](http://www.ryesf.com/)'s Basil Gimlet*

* 2 ounces No. 209 gin

* Half a lime

* ½ oz. simple syrup

* 5 basil leaves

To make simple syrup, bring 2 cups water and 1 cup sugar to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for roughly 15 minutes. Keep refrigerated.

Gently muddle basil, fresh lime juice, and simple syrup in a mixing glass with a wooden muddler. Add ice and gin. Shake vigorously, and strain into a martini glass. Garnish with a basil leaf or lime wedge.

Tip: You could make it with vodka, but it’s far more interesting with gin. Also, if the basil sits around for a day or so, it doesn’t have the crisp freshness critical to the drink’s success.

*[Farmer Brown](http://www.farmerbrownsf.com/)'s Grapefruit Gimlet*

* 1 ½ oz. Grapefruit-Infused vodka*

* Juice of 1 medium lime [about 2 tablespoons]

* Dash simple syrup

* Grapefruit twist for garnish

Shake all ingredients in a cocktail shaker and pour into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a grapefruit twist and serve.

*Grapefruit Vodka [delicious in a number of drinks, especially a vodka tonic.]
Rinds of 2 large grapefruits
1 750-milliliter bottle unflavored vodka

Combine grapefruit rinds and vodka in an airtight container. Allow to infuse 24 hours in a cool, dark place.

Knowing this, my friend asked me on Friday night to bar tend his birthday party Saturday night.  He was providing the spirits and had a bar etc.  So without lots of time I pulled together this menu of 4 drinks, which were spin offs of recipes I've seen via this subreddit.   

I thought I'd share with you folks because I had a great experience both preparing for and making drinks for 30 or so people.  

I didn't know everyone who was coming, so I decided to make one accessible cocktail for 4 different spirits (Vodka, Bourbon Whisk(e)y, Rum and Gin).  The birthday boy likes Gin, so his was a bit of extra fancy.  Everything was made within a 6 hours of the party starting.

Vodka Punch
*oleo saccharum with lemons and rosemary
*added 1 dash of Ango and served on the rocks with a sprig of rosemary as the garnish.

Unicorn Club
*1.5 oz Bourbon
*0.5 oz Maraschino Liqueur
*0.5 oz Campari
*1.0 oz OJ
*Garnished w/2 Luxardo Cherries

I should buy a boat (Recipe from measureandstir)
*1.5 oz Dark Rum
*1.0 oz Ruby Red Grapefruit
*0.5 oz Cinnamon/Vanilla Simple (1:1)
*1 to 2 oz champagne float
*garnish with slice of grapefruit and grated cinnamon

Out of this world (spin off of Barrel Aged Monogram from measureandstir)
*1.5 oz gin
*1.0 oz earl grey tea 
*0.5 oz maraschino
*0.5 oz lemon juice
*garnished with grapefruit infused gin foam; the foam was then monogrammed by spraying fee brothers aged orange bitters through a stencil on top.

They were all just north of sweet but fairly balanced and accessible to the drinkers who don't enjoy a pour of fernet or some strong aperitif.

Lets get this week going with the Mint Julep in honor of HBO's new horse racing show.  Plenty of time to get this perfect before the Kentucky derby this year.

*Ingredients*

 * Mint

 * Bourbon

 * [Simple Syrup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-1USJM_Bl4)


*Process*

* In a lowball glass (what I typically use) add 6 or so mint leaves and a squirt of simple syrup.  Muddle a bit (not needed).

* Fill glass with ice

* Add in 3-4 ounces of bourbon

* Stir well

Posting the CoW this week on behalf of j_alt.  I figured we'd go with the grandaddy of them all.  The ingredients are incredibly straightforward, but everyone seems to have their own preferred preparation method.  

Here's my take:

* 3-4 oz Bourbon
* 1 sugar cube
* 2 dashes Ango Bitters
* 2 dashes Orange Bitters
* 1 tsp water
* Orange Zest
* Cherry (optional)

Rub the inside of an Old-Fashioned or Rocks glass with the orange zest, then add the sugar cube. Soak with the bitters, add 1 tsp water, and muddle.  Add 1 oz of the Bourbon and stir. Add ice to fill glass, then add the last of Bourbon and stir some more. Garnish with the orange zest (or a fresh orange slice) and optional cherry. Don't let soda water anywhere near anything.

This is probably my all-time favorite drink, so I'm really looking forward to hearing other peoples methods!

We(me, husband,sister iaw and her husband) went to a restaurant for lunch. They had Moscow mule (my favorite drink) on the menu. I decide to order. Waitress tells us they ask for collateral (keys,drivers license etc...) in order to serve the drink because of people stealing the cups. 

I tell them I'm not comfortable in giving up my ID just because they are afraid I'll steal the mug (copper mug) and that they can put it in another glass. The manager gets mad because I suggest that.refuses to give us the drink,words get exchanged(seriously) and we are asked to leave. 

Now I've been asked for an collateral on an open bar tab before,but not because a place was afraid someone will walk off with a mug and also I've been to many places where I've had the copper mug and never have I thought to take because I don't want it. 

1) is the look of the drink so important that you will not serve it in a specific mug/cup/glass?

I've tried real vanilla bean and vanilla extract, but I just can't get it right.  I'm relatively new to cocktails, but is there a vanilla liqueur they may have used?  Or am I just not using enough bean/extract?

The big question: If you want prominent vanilla flavor in a cocktail, what's you preferred method?

Hello,
 
Glad you enjoyed it! It’s one of my favorite creations as well, awesome on a cool winter’s night.

Victoria ($49.95, made in BC Canada)  
No. 3 Gin ($49.95)  
The London #1 Gin ($43.60) this one is goddamn blue 
Gin Mare ($54.95)  
The Botanist ($45.40)  
Distillers Gin #6 ($44.90)

1360167429.0	18066g	Going to experiment with barrel aging, how should I start?	therationalpi	16	1	9	"I can't remember who originally posted it, but I saw a comment on here before Christmas that mentioned [these barrel aging kits](http://tuthilltown.gostorego.com/barrels/barrel-aged-cocktail-kit.html) that are a cheap way to experiment with barrel aging in small batches (protip: If you buy [barrel staves](http://tuthilltown.gostorego.com/barrels/barrel-aged-cocktail-kit-refill.html) and [corked bottles](http://tuthilltown.gostorego.com/barware/bottle-empty-375ml.html) separately, you'll get get 2 more staves at the same price). While I didn't find a kit under my tree this year, I did just purchase two kits for myself to play with, and I need to come up with some good drinks to fill up those bottles.

My first drink will certainly be a manhattan of some sort. I've already found that pre-mixing a bottle of manhattans allows the flavors to meld better, and would like to see that taken to the next level with barrel aging. It's also a great use for a beautiful, lead-free, [whiskey decanter](http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Madison-Whiskey-Decanter/dp/B009FMOUQO/ref=pd_sbs_k_4). On top of that, the manhattan was really my gateway into cocktails, and holds a special place in my heart. I've ordered the [Buffalo Trace White Dog Rye Mash](http://www.drinkhacker.com/2011/09/12/review-buffalo-trace-white-dog-wheated-mash-and-rye-mash/), an unaged rye whiskey, and plan to combine that with *Carpano Antica* and Angostura, for a very conventional take on the Manhattan. I'll probably do a side-by-side with the unaged version of that cocktail, the aged version, and a bottle aged manhattan made with Bulleit Rye.

That still leaves me with a bottle to experiment with. I've been considering gin cocktails for this, since the aging would add a unique dimension to the traditionally unaged character of gin. I'm considering a classic martini (complete with orange bitters), a negroni, or a vesper. All of them are drinks I plan to make at some point, but the real question is which one gets the honor of being first?

Any thoughts or tips on this whole barrel-aging process? I'm curious what ya'll have to say."	t5_2qpco	True

My last name is a shiny metal spelled wrong, so what i'm going for is something that looks very metallic / silvery.

I've been playing on my own to try and find something - what i came up with was this glittery silver powder to pour into a drink, which looks very cool. The problem is to make a drink palatable to most people it needs fruit juice which of course turns it from being a silver drink to an orange, red, or pink drink; with silver sparkles.

http://www.amazon.com/Food-Grade-Platinum-Edible-Glitter-Silver/dp/B0013374S4
This is what i bought - it actually looks very cool but it is definitely a silvery glitter suspended in liquid.

I'm not sure if anybody has a better idea, in which case what i'm looking for is the best way to make a silver/grey cocktail which i can add this too. So something without the typical pink/red/orange colors.

Any ideas?

I'm going to give the drink a name to go with my last name - regardless of what it actually is. For comparison my cousins got married and they started the trend. It was the Bluementhal - Goldberg wedding, so the drinks were the ""Blue Menthol"" and the ""Gold Berg"".

BarkingLeopard	15	1	24	"I was a bit reluctant/lazy, but after hearing everyone hear rave about the taste of fresh-squeezed juices vs the bottled juices, I finally broke down and dropped $5 on a painted/coated aluminum lemon juicer from Walmart.  Limes especially are fairly cheap (I think I paid 3/$1 a few weeks ago, and they keep well in the fridge), and the taste difference is obvious even without doing a side by side comparison.  DEFINITELY get into freshly squeezed juices if you aren't already; it's a $5 juicer plus the paring knife you already have, and the fruit wedges make for nice garnishes that really up the psychological experience of the drink (something to be said for feeling classy!).


Also, I was never a fan of vermouth, and questioned whether I'd be able to tell the difference between a freshly opened bottle of vermouth and one that had been sitting, opened, on my shelf for months.  Wrong!  I bought a few 375mL bottles and did a couple of side by side comparisons of straight vermouth, and even with cheap Martini &amp; Rossi vermouth (dry and sweet varieties) I could really tell a difference.  First time that I can ever remember vermouth actually tasting GOOD.  


Now my smaller bottles of opened vermouth are in the fridge, while my old bottles are either poured down the drain or on their way to the car's trunk.  The next time I go downtown, I will remove the opened bottles of stale vermouth from the trunk and hand them to the bums on the sidewalk (hey, just because it's stale vermouth doesn't mean that it has to go to waste, even stale vermouth is better than Boone's Farm)."	t5_2qpco	True

First attempt: [White Rye Manhattan](http://imgur.com/a/Av1mQ) (pics)

* 175ml dry vermouth 
* 2 dashes Regan's Orange bitters #6
* 2 dashes Angostura Orange bitters

Aged three weeks.

Result: Okay, not great.

I find the unaged Rye basically undrinkable on its own. I wanted to see what effect the oak would have on it. After three weeks, the sharp edges of the rye were almost totally smoothed over, which left the vermouth to dominate. No trace of orange bitters remains (should have used more).

My taste-testers agreed it tastes like an interesting white wine, not too dry. So that's not a total loss. But if you're expecting the floral sweetness of a traditional Manhattan, you will be disappointed.

I'm sure most of us are familiar with bacon-infused bourbon and the like, which utilize the fats from rendering/cooking meat, adding it to a spirit, chilling to solidify the fats, then removing the fat cap resulting in the infused meat/smoke/etc. flavors in the spirit. In this case, Aaron Polsky of Monan in NYC is using Crisco, a hydrogenated vegetable oil that can solidify, and uses it to capture the aromatics from things like coffee or tea. He claims that it better captures the flavors than a straight infusion or brewing of coffee or tea, respectively. Two of his cocktails that caught my eye are below. It seems like an interesting idea and from a chemistry standpoint, I can see how using this technique could result in a different flavor profile. Has anyone tried this? What do more experienced bartenders think? Gimmick or a potential innovation?

Really I just don't want to pay nearly $30 a bottle for something that has no competition. I don't like the monopoly they seem to have over the Negroni market.



My ingredients list comes mainly from the 1983 book *Big Secrets*.



The ingredients (in parts):

* 20 Bitter Orange Peel

* 16 Angelica Root

* 16 Buckbean Leaves

* 16 Lemon Peel

* 12 Anise

* 12 Calamus

* 12 Fennel

* 12 Orris Root

* 12 Wormwood Leaves

* 8 Cinnamon

* 7 Cloves

* 5 Marjoram

* 5 Sage

* 5 Thyme

* 2 Rosemary



The recipe says all parts are percolated with 50% alcohol. The resulting infusing is then to be used to flavour a large amount of alcohol/water mixture. After that a bit of red carmine and brown carmel for color. 



My plan is to infuse all source-able ingredients with 95% grain alcohol, strain and mix to taste with a much lesser strength spirit. 



Any experience or advice in this venture is welcome.

1. Slice apples into cubes. Muddle apples and crushed ice together in a rocks glass
2. Stir Genever, Vermouth, Angostura. Strain into rocks glass.

There is a lot of tricks to them and most bars I find make them wrong unless your at a place that charges a lot. I am going to use this tread to add all that I know about Manhattans feel free to add information in the comments.


**Background**

Manhattans are one of the oldest cocktails and were invented in.... MANHATTAN. There are many rumors to where and when in NYC it was conceived but it is not known for certain. The original Manhattans were made with American Rye Whiskey, Italian Vermouth and Angostura bitters.  A manhattan is very similar to a martini made with whiskey, with few very important differences. The amount of Vermouth and bitters. There are variations on garnish but the traditional is a cherry. 


**What you need and what I use**

1) A glass - Martini glass, a champagne coupe (my personal favorite, the shape allows for you to take in the aromas of your drink), or a wine glass (if you do not have the others)

2) A cocktail strainer or something to strain out the ice.

3) A mixing spoon DO NOT SHAKE A MANHATTAN 

4) A speed pourer - These help you measure your drink and are relatively costless. If you don't have one just use a very good eye. 

5) Whiskey - American Rye or American Bourbon: Just like with a martini, you do not want to use the well to make your drink.  The main flavor of the manhattan is the whiskey and although you don't have to spend a tone to make the drink, don't just use anything. I use Rye usually but it depends on your mood and taste which is right for you. Rye typically is less sweet and prevents your drink from being super sweet and has a nice spice to it that is very pleasant to the pallet.  I like to use (Ri)1 (almost no sweetness to this one and a little bitter for a rye, it blends well with vermouth), Willet straight rye whiskey (this one is very spicy and strong, not for the weak willed), any Redemption bourbon (I choose this if I have a desire to drink bourbon, this is a not as sweet bourbon and goes well with the vermouth, or if I am feeling cheap Old Overholt (this is the cheapest passible whiskey IMO and at $15 a bottle you really cannot go wrong).

6) Vermouth Sweet or dry - A traditional manhattan is made with sweet, a perfect manhattan is made with both, and a dry manhattan is made with dry vermouth. (I make dry manhattans, dry vermouth is still very sweet and I like to taste my whiskey) I use Cocchi vermouth as it is great for it's price.

7) Bitters - Trust me you want to use bitters. Bitters is like salt for whiskey, it brings out the flavors or the drink and makes it taste better but you don't want to drink it by itself. I use ""the bitter truth old time aromatic bitters"" I find it to be superior to Angostura and is about the same price but you can use whatever suits your taste.  You can use orange bitters but it will drastically change the flavor of your drink so I would advise against it unless you feel like something different.

8)Garnish - cherries or orange peal (I use moonshine soaked cherries that I pat down with a paper towel to make sure they are dry)

9) ice  - Regular ice cube tray works fine.


**How to make**

1) Take your martini glass and chill it by adding ice over the top and filling with water

2) In a separate glass add the following ingredients 
     a) a six count of your whiskey (1 1/2 ounces)
     b) a two count of vermouth (1/2 ounce; if making a perfect a one count of each type) I actually halve the vermouth but that is my preference
     c) two drops of bitters 

3) Add ice over the liquid and stir with a mixing spoon or just a table spoon if you do not have that. Do not stir to violently.

4) Empty your martini glass and shake over the sink to get the excess water out.

5) Strain the Manhattan into your martini glass 

6) add garnish


**Why you do not shake a manhattan**

The reason you do not shake a manhattan is that it ""bruises"" the whiskey and changes it's texture.  You want your manhattan to be smooth like silk and if you shake it you will loose that affect.

This is a first pass at this and my first post so I may add stuff later if I forgot anything.

Enjoy!!!

A class-A joint, seriously. They only do sit-down service, and they have a bartender for every five or so people. Our bartender, Jim (or Jeff...), was very very experienced, and did a very good job with recommendations for my friend and I, though I just drank an old fashioned, because I was driving.

At minimum, I know I need a shaker (or glass set + strainer), jigger, and a knife for cutting fruit. Maybe a few spots for some thin vials of vermouths and bitters?

I like the look of this roll:
http://www.amazon.com/Uber-Bar-Tools-BostonBarRoll-US/dp/B0042L3CC6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373815779&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=bartender+kit+knife

But it doesn't have any room for even some very small nested glasses (not a huge deal I guess), and I'd probably remove some of the extraneous tools and replace with narrow vials of mixers.

This one is pretty, but I fear too impractical:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QTUJWO/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=A2L77EE7U53NWQ&amp;seller=

The use of space is kind of dumb; honestly I'd probably just take almost everything out and replace with some kind of foam insert and fill it back up with stuff. There's an Amazon Warehouse deal on it for $88, which makes it pretty attractive, but for how I plan to use it I'd basically just be buying it as a segmented case. Tongs, seriously? Fuck tongs, I have hands. And why does it have a hawthorne strainer if it comes with a cobbler shaker?

1373465037.0	1i09y2	Barrel Aging Advice?	slickricks	12	1	5	"Hey folks,

So, I'm getting married about a year from now, and I definitely want to serve 2-3 barrel aged cocktails. I was thinking something along the lines of a Manhattan, Boulevardier (inspired by High West's latest), or Negroni, but am open to ideas. 

The wedding will have about 200 or so guests, not all of whom are serious cocktail drinkers (I'm guessing about 100 or so will have one, with maybe 30-50 people having more than one). So, I'm guessing I should be aiming to yield about 200-300 drinks = ~600-900 oz = ~5-7 gallons (though that may be too much).

So what I'm looking for is some logistical advice. Anyone have experience planning the numbers out like that? Am I way over- (or under-)estimating? Any advice on the actual process would be helpful, though I've read a few of the articles floating around (Morgenthaler's, etc.).

As far as barrels go, I've seen [this 2.5 gallon one](http://www.1000oaksbarrel.com/en/oak-barrels/1018-oaks-barrel/138-1652013-02-27-21-59-22-806-8072013-02-28-00-37-43-8102013-02-28-00-42-58-812-813-814-detail.html), which looks slightly overpriced, but I know it's an odd size to look for. Does it make more sense to get a few staves and just use glass containers?

And if anyone is in the DC area, I'd be happy to buy you a drink to talk over!

Anyway, I'm really open to any and all advice, so feel free to fire away (or PM me if you want to talk in private). Thanks!"	t5_2qpco	True

&gt; **Secret Bonus for Reading this Far – Salt:**

&gt;The secret ingredient in our cocktails isn’t love, it’s salt. A pinch of salt added to most cocktails brightens them up and rounds out the flavor tremendously. You don’t need a lot.  Add so little you don’t even perceive saltiness –I call it “sub-threshold salting”.  Sugar and vanilla also do interesting things in sub-threshold quantities.  When I distill liquor, I usually add a small amount of salt and sugar  – not enough sugar to add sweetness.



I can't really find much about it. There is a 'tip' on the [Belvedere site](http://www.belvederevodka.com/mixology/bartender-secrets) and a short discussion about it on the [egullet forums](http://forums.egullet.org/topic/144769-salt-in-cocktails/) but not much detailed explanation.

I chose it because I do like the smokiness of scotch, and this apparently is the smokiest you can get. I also got it because I have seen it named specifically a number of times as an ingredient (or usually a rinse or dash) in a handful of cocktails. However I can't seem to find any of those recipes.

So do you guys know any recipes that use either Laphroaig or other Islay scotches as an ingredient? Or maybe you have some ideas of existing cocktails that could be modified with a strong smokey flavor.

EDIT:

Since people seem to get really offended by the idea of consuming scotch any way other than neat, I feel it is necessary to let you know that that is exactly how I intend to consume the vast majority of this bottle. I'm only looking for recipes that call for a dash, or a rinse at the most."	t5_2qpco	True

I already have angostura bitters and becherovka bitters, though I'm not sure how to use the latter.

I think keeping a limit of 3-4 different cocktails will be more than enough since only 3-4 people will be drinking them. I'd also rather keep a small amount of ingredients (mainly the hard liquors, if I have to get a few different fruit juices that's less of a problem.)

The obvious solution--pourers! I ordered a batch of cheap plastic ones that seemed to have OK reviews. I tried one out, and it worked great. Problem solved. Excellent! Let's just do a little reading and make sure it won't be a problem to have the bottles sitting there unsealed.....OK, bad idea, problem not solved.

I next tried [some of these Cap-On pourers](http://www.barproducts.com/media/cap-on-imix.html). These were a mixed bag; they work great on some bottles, but on others they dribble out. On my Green Chartreuse bottle it was almost worse with the pourer in. I haven't figured out why there's a difference.

1336568446.0	temht	[Cocktail of the Week] Week 11 - Cuba Libre	therationalpi	12	0	18	"Don't turn up your nose at the humble *Cuba Libre*, also known as a *Rum and Coke*. It's a dead simple highball, but it's also the world's second most popular cocktail, and a damned refreshing one at that. Anyone can make it, anyone can drink it: that's the beauty of the *Cuba Libre*.

**History**

Far from just a drink's name, ""Cuba Libre"" was the battle cry of a fledgeling nation. In 1900, after a series of bloody wars beginning with the Ten Years' War from 1868-1878 and ending with the Cuban War of Independence from 1895-1898, Cuba had finally earned their independence from Spain. It was at this time that Coca-Cola first found its way to Cuban shores, imported from their friends in the United States (who helped them earn their independence). This was a very different Coca-Cola from what we know today, with about 9 mg of cocaine per serving. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is that it pairs well with the cane-sugar derived rum so common in this island nation. Add a little lime and a healthy dose of nationalist pride, and the *Cuba Libre* was born.

Who drank the first Cuba Libre? We may never know. Bacardi, of course, claims that their own rum starred in the first drink, ordered by a Captain Russell from the United States Army Signal Corps, though this claim is suspect. There's at least one account that it was a member of the Signal Corps, but that man was not positively identified as anyone beyond ""John Doe.""

From Cuba, the Rum and Coke began its assault on the world. It spread through the Caribbean, where rum was plentiful, making a notable foothold in Trinidad. When American troops were dispatched to this little island nation during World War II, the locals were inspired to write a little calypso song:

&gt; Since the Yankees come to Trinidad

&gt; They have the young girls going mad

&gt; The young girls say they treat them nice

&gt; And they give them a better price

&gt; They buy rum and coca-cola

&gt; Go down Point Cumana

&gt; Both mother and daughter

&gt; Working for the the Yankee dollar

&gt; -Rupert Westmore Grant ""Rum and Coca-Cola""

The song became very popular in the US, but only after Morey Amsterdam stole it to claim as his own (along with the proceeds). Still, the song ""Rum and Coca-Cola,"" as performed by Andrews Sisters, helped to shine the limelight on the Cuba Libre and catapult it to worldwide fame.

**Ingredients**

As the name is used today, a *Cuba Libre* is distinct from a *Rum and Coke* through the inclusion of lime juice. Some also contend that coke sweetened with sugar is a necessity to match the sugar derived rum better, your mileage may vary.

*2 oz Light rum*

*4 oz Coca-Cola*

*0.5 oz Lime juice (Half a lime)*

**Making the Cuba Libre**

Fill a highball glass with ice. Add lime juice and rum. Top with Coca-Cola. Garnish with a lime wedge.

**Variations**

* Captain and Coke uses Captain Morgan spiced rum, and omits the lime juice.

* Replacing some of the Coca-cola with club soda results in a lighter, fizzier drink, that doesn't cover the rum as much.

* In Trinidad, a few dashes of Angostura bitters can be included.

* Cherry or Vanilla coke can be used, as can flavored rum. Malibu Rum + Cherry Coke = Coppertone

* [Coke with dark rum and amaretto supposedly brings out the almond-cherry flavor of coke.](http://mixthatdrink.com/mixys-rum-and-coke/)

Total cost of this experiment, including alcohol, herbs, Ball jars, and cheesecloth =  $157.83. But I have a TON of herbs left over for future bittering experiments.

[ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/ENFeD)

I couldn't find high-proof rye at a decent price and so used high-proof bourbon instead. Wild Turkey 101. I used the oranges for zest and to make the dried orange peel.

I was hesitant to attempt this recipe because it's so labor intensive. Then I decided to experiment with the preparation methods to try to simplify the process for future attempts.

**Method 1: By the book**

* Allow all ingredients to soak in whiskey for 2 weeks; shake daily.
* Strain out the solids and save the infused whiskey.
* Boil/simmer the solids in water and allow to steep in the water one more week.
* Strain out the solids and add the infused water to the infused whiskey.
* Voila.

**Method 2: Cook ingredients first**

* Boil/simmer the ingredients in water.
* Add water and solids to whiskey.
* Steep for 3-4 weeks; shake daily.
* Strain out the solids.
 
**Method 3: No cook, just steep**

* Add ingredients to mixture of water and whiskey.
* Allow to steep for 3-4 weeks, shaking daily.
* Strain out the solids.

If you're interested, I'll let you know in a month how it all turned out.

1368138677.0	1e14uj	Cocktails, Personified	ClamydiaDellArte	24	12	3	"If various drinks were people, what would they be like?

**Negroni**

The Negroni is a very odd, very rich European, probably in his late 50's.  He comes from a noble family (and makes a very big deal out of this, even if his country no longer recognizes the distinction), or, at the very least, extremely old money- his level of eccentricity and general disconnect from the rest of humanity can only come from generations of people with too much time on their hands.  He enjoys making his household staff dress up in silly outfits, and refuses to eat off orange plates (orange bowls are fine).  He's obsessed with a certain breed of dog, probably Scottish Terriers or Miniature Schnauzers.  His house is filled with paintings, sculptures, and other memorabilia depicting them.  Ironically, he only keeps cats.

He doesn't have any kids, although he was married to the Gimlet for a time, until his general weirdness and very ""unique"" bedroom proclivities drove her away.  He comes from a very large family spread out all over the world, including the Boulevardier, who moved to New York to work on Wall St.  He makes a genuine effort to stay in touch with all of them, even if it's only a rather impersonal letter every few years.

**Manhattan**

The archetypal lovable asshole.  Works for the same firm as the Boulevardier and is actually his wife's 3rd cousin, although ironically the two have never met (it's a very large firm).  He's been married to the same woman for over a decade, but many suspect he's in an open relationship, although no one has any hard evidence.  As much of a conceited douche as he is, he doesn't come across as the infidelitous type.

He only drives German sports cars.  He'd really like a Ferrari, but self-consciously refuses to, referring to them as ""midlife crisis mobiles.""  He'll probably buy one when he hits 55 and realizes he doesn't actually care what people think anymore.  He also owns a speedboat.  He's really into sports, especially the Yankees, although he gets really mad if anyone points out how much they suck at the moment.  He's currently obsessed with soccer, or at least tells everyone he is because he thinks it makes him look sophisticated."	t5_2qpco	True

Got a bottle of blanco 1800, figured it fit the bill as a safe brand name probably-overpriced-but-reliable mid shelf 100% agave tequila (as the experts recommend). Made a margarita in the classic fashion (and not the way I usually make them for friends) with 1.5 ounces tequila, 1 ounce Cointreau, .5 ounces lime shaken and served on the rocks and suddenly realized I like tequila. My experience with tequila has been making syrup drinks with Cuervo for friends who like that stuff. Now I actually enjoy the drink and decided to get into it.

I am a big whiskey drinker. I like very short drinks. I like neat whiskey. I prefer American whiskey, specifically rye these days, but scotch is what piqued my interest in brown liquor.

So I picked up some reposado tequila, specifically Corralejo. It looked good online and since most tequila seems to be marketing gimmick bottles, it filled my requirement of being suspiciously unassuming which I know is an important factor when I shop for ryes (think Rittenhouse and Old Overholt) and bourbon (Old Granddad). I was leaning towards añejos but I feel like i have a ton of non-whiskey whiskeys already (cognac, aged rum, etc) and the internet made it sound like a lot of aged tequilas are just another type of whiskey with no agave characteristics, just an agave mash and some export technicalities. So I settled on reposado.

The problem is, I can't really find anything to make with it. I like drinks that are simple in the sense that I don't have to find teaspoons and dashes of ingredients that I have to hunt down for half a day in NYC and drop $30 a bottle for. My favorite drinks include very short and dry Sazeracs and Old Fashioneds as well as classically made Martinis and Manhattans (not afraid of vermouth here if it's good aka Dolin and Cocchi).

I may sound like a pretentious dolt in this post but I'm not too worried because I'll bet at this point most people in this subreddit are nodding their heads in agreement.

So what I am asking is, what is a good way to drink reposado (or añejo) tequila in a cocktail that brings out the tequila instead of disguising it.

I made an Old Fashioned using the Corralejo and here is the recipe, to get things started:

1.5 ounces tequila
1 dash Angostura
Quarter teaspoon dark agave syrup
Stir in short glass

I like Old Fashioneds warm and iceless, so this may strike people as too short or too warm or too undiluted or whatever. So what I would suggest is take your favorite method of making an old fashioned, replace the bourbon with the tequila, cut down on your Angostura dashing if using a reposado (don't wanna drown it out) and use agave syrup instead of sugar (but in smaller amounts; the syrup should have a conversion on the back for cane sugar in recipes).
