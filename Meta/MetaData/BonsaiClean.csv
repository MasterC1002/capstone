We are now over 4000 subscribers, and things are progressing well. Newbies are taken care of, people are getting feedback, and while we haven't reached the upper echelons of bonsai culture (yet?), the group feels inclusive and encouraging, and perhaps we've saved a few trees lives. Just like bonsai, the first priority is care and maintenance, and while I try to keep up with everyone, I'm approaching my limits.

small_trunks has been making improvements to the subreddit before, via requests and excellent content, and has now taken up my request, and I look forward to seeing his impact even more.

1337195161.0	tqdd0	Hey guys, love seeing your works. Did you know that most amazing bonsai are chopped down from big trees and not grown from seed/saplings?	myopinionstinks	40	3	108	"I'm a huge fan of promoting bonsai and i'm the leading recruiter for my club. I wanted to send a PSA to some of the folks we've seen flocking to this sub recently. Love that you folks trust us to advise you on your newly acquired elms/ficus/junipers that are ""sticks in pots"" often with ornaments to boot. That's where I started also. It's a fine gateway bonsai. 
     
I'd like to see more beginners run out to the nursery and start chopping up plants. Crude wiring and root pruning to follow. Killing trees left and right will keep your excitement level up as you research. It's going to take a LOT of studying before you even know that you know squat. 

Finally, most bonsai that are exceptional come from the *ground*. They were either grown in the ground for bonsai at a nursery, pulled up from landscapes, or taken from the wild. Big thick trunks are sexy (literati aside) and portray strength and age. This takes a **long** time. Rarely is a brand new practitioner going to sow some seeds and then 15 years later work on the material when it's ready.... Yes, it takes that long sometimes (i'm thinking pines especially but also fat junipers) 

The Japanese kept this a secret from us for as long as they could (as I've been told by multiple masters: Bill Valavanis/Roy Nagatoshi included) but now we know:

    

**Most good bonsai are cut down, not grown up**

Also, please don't be in a rush to put a tree in a bonsai pot. Limiting the root growth by restricting space slows your tree's growth. 

In conclusion:
    
Fat trunk &gt; Stick in a Pot

   
I'm not trying to poop on your dreams, just think that beginners are better served by working with nursery material than planting a few seeds and waiting a decade to start creating and taking care of potential bonsai.

Now if you're serious about doing this, read the link on the right (that's a frikkin good list) and get your hands in some foliage. You can grow from seeds too, but that's like watching paint dry rather than finger painting.

Firstly big ups to this subreddit being super helpful to both novice and advanced hobbyists!!  I really appreciate all info present and posted, but I find one huge aspect of bonsai missing: tree age.  I feel like one of the most appropriate, tantalizing, and down-right awesome ideas of keeping bonsai is that these trees can and will outlive us, and I feel that allot of beginners fail to realize that not much can be done with a 3-5 year old tree.

Half the time I see someone ask for help regarding their first tree, people often glance over the most realistic first step which is letting that little twig grow for another half-decade.  These trees are truly investments, and I honestly feel like this needs to be stressed.  "	t5_2qowd	True

I am affiliated with a bonsai nursery in the New England area, which was just broken into. Several venerable older trees were stolen. This is a long shot but I am providing this information on the off chance that some tuned in Redditor notices the trees sitting in a neighbors yardâ€¦ or something. These trees are very valuable and require very specific care. Some of them have been cared for for generations by knowledgeable people. It is not likely that they are in good hands, and not likely that they can be easily sold to qualified caretakers. They need to be outside or in a climate controlled greenhouse to survive.

Though the trees are valuable it would be difficult to sell them, as the bonsai community is fairly small and close knit. I cannot imagine someone would try to sell them online, but you never know.

Please upvote for maximum exposure. If you happen across these trees please contact me here so we can alert the police. I will be available to answer questions. Thank you.

* http://imgur.com/a/DA9JH (close-up and soil)

The tree has been in my grandfathers care for about 35 years but he dug it up when the trunk was around the third of it's current size. So estimating 50+ years old (could totally be off and it could be much older). My grandfather has had Parkinson's for about 15 years now and cannot take care of the tree anymore. For the last 5 years I have been taking care of him on a day to day basis and within the last 2 years I have been learning bonsai from him. He has explained some things to me in general and smaller tree care is fine but this is a whole other monster to tackle. Two people cannot even lift this thing on its own. The soil is weed infested, spotty in some areas and I have no clue where the pellets came from. (fertilizer?) You can also see the pot  is crooked from the root structure pushing up from the bottom causing the soil to slide slowly to one edge of the pot. He said all i need to do is break the pot, re-soil and be done with it. (his mind isn't in the best shape and he makes it sound way easier than I feel by looking at it) Please congregrate your minds and help me out in some way, this tree is beautiful and jumping with life. There are days where I just sit and wonder how this thing has become its own ecosystem. I do not want his 35+ years of work to come to an end."	t5_2qowd	True

[Trees](http://i.imgur.com/zfNbd.jpg)

From left to right, two brush cherries, a ficus, a white pine, a bougainvillea, and a brush cherry. Please let me know if you know anything.

If you stole them, please take care of them properly or sell them to someone that can.  All but the pine are tropical.  They should be outside in full sun until the temperature starts getting below 50 at night and then brought in for the winter and put under artificial lighting.  The pine should stay outside, but protected from strong wind throughout the winter."	t5_2qowd	True

One sprouted today and this is what it looks like.  What do I do to style it?  I'd like to make it into one of those S shaped trees like you see at the mall.

I watch a lot of youtube. Whenever I come across a channel with bonsai videos I subscribe to them. I wanted to share my list so some of you can find new vids and perhaps if you know of a channel, you can offer it up as well. I'm just going to list the channels rather than make them all links. Some of these guys you'll recognize. A bunch are not in English but I still feel like you can take something away from watching; if that's your thing.

1369921888.0	1fc3jq	Thanks /r/bonsai	BaconPanda	21	2	10	"Just wanted to say thanks for the advice and inspiration I've received on here.  One particularly helpful tip was to seek out real live bonsai practitioners/enthusiasts/growers (what is the right term here?)  Anyway, sent an email out of the blue to the members of the Azalea City Bonsai Society in Mobile, AL, USA prior to a visit last weekend.  I ended up visiting a gentleman named Joe Day, who has an amazing collection and decades of experience.  A true gentleman.  Look him up if you're in the area.

In the span of a few hours, which Mr. Day was kind enough to spend answering my questions, I learned more about the craft than I've learned in years of tinkering.  So, I'll pass on this great advice again.  Get out there and meet real bonsai people in your area, or find them on your travels.  Turns out they're probably far more welcoming than you might expect and you really can't beat the experience.  

It was great to see hundreds of great trees in person and be able to hear the stories behind some of them.  Rather inspiring to see trees in all stages of progression too; not just show pieces.  So, while /r/bonsai has been an invaluable resource for me, along with other websites and books, there really is no replacement for actual in-person experiences.  Picked up this neat little boxwood too.  I really dig its natural ""oaky"" style.  (Army man added for scale)  http://imgur.com/a/AkVVC

TL;DR: Get out there and talk to real, live bonsai people too.  You'll learn a lot faster."	t5_2qowd	True

1316109073.0	kgq5y	My $10 Bonsai Experiment	Jarfol	22	3	9	"About a month ago I was bored.  I had an itch to work on a tree but nothing needed to be done, so I decided to go to Home Depot and just buy the best material I could find.

The pickings were slim but I just grabbed the best I could find, a Japanese Evergreen Holly (Ilex crenata).  There were more than a dozen there but none of them had anything close to a decent trunkline except for this one.  The tree cost me $6.50.  

Then I swung by Walmart and grabbed a bag of [Special Kitty cat litter](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Special-Kitty-Natural-Cat-Litter-25-lb/10293705?).  I had never tried cat litter before and most brands don't work for bonsai, but I heard rumors about this particular kind being useful.  $3.50 for a 25 lb bag.

So I brought the tree home, and did some hardcore top and root pruning (especially roots, I really tore them out).  I then repotted it in a bigger bulb plastic pot with about 75% cat litter, 25% perlite, and a dash of Osmocote.  I didn't think I would post this on reddit or else I would have documented a bit of this.  

[So here is the before and after.](http://imgur.com/a/KiIOY)  A month later, and the tree is doing fine.  Still not pushing buds yet but there is a ton of new root growth.  When I pruned it I wanted to cut it even shorter, but its not a bad idea to leave a fair amount of foliage for the plant.  Once it (hopefully) gets some good back-budding on those stumps, I will cut those long branches on the top back to the first or second leaves.

Its still a good year or two at least from a bonsai, but for $10 I think its pretty good so far.  Fingers crossed that the cat litter works out, and I get some good back-budding.  "	t5_2qowd	True

The main problems were that it was in a 3 gallon pot and the guy said that it was a ""ground cover"" breed of juniper, and he said it would be tough as a bonsai. 

Is this true? Or do you think it would be worth a try. I've called around and its the only viable candidate for a bonsai anywhere in my area. But do you think I should wait until I have a greater selection in the spring?

EDIT Ok I got it and took some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/5eVdO). Its a chinese juniper. I have an Idea of what I want to keep (everything highlighted in red already exists in the plant and would make a good composition, That ""s"" curve is the present line of the trunk. My questions are, if I hack off all of the foliage except what's in red... is that too much too quickly? If it is, what's the right timing? I've read in some places that jan/feb is the time to do it, lots of others say spring. If it's not too much too soon, is there a good guide to pruning, including how to get off that entire extra trunk without killing/hurting the tree, and how to get all of those extra small branches off without the trunk ending up looking like shit

Since a few months I've been cleaning at a dentist's during the weekends and evenings. She has a very nice bonsai-tree in the waiting room and it's about 10-15 years old now. The previous cleaner was in charge of taking care of it, since the dentist doesn't really know how to do that. And now it's my job. 

When I started working there, the tree looked half-dead. There were very little leaves on it and it had quite a few dead branches. Also lots of tall branches. Since then I've pruned it where I deemed necessary (mostly apical) and it looks a lot healthier now, so I think I'm doing something right. But I didn't dare touch the bigger branches, specifically two of them.

[Here are some pictures of the tree.](http://imgur.com/a/jCAgV)

- For the first branch, I'm not sure if I should cut it at red or blue. It sticks out a good 30-50 cm before it even starts growing leaves. That's why I prefer red, since it's closer to the core of the tree, but I don't know if the tree can handle that. So that's what I want to ask you.

- I want to cut the second branch at the pink line. This was the branch I've pruned the most since I got there and has since grown quite full. However, just like the first branch, it's sticking out a lot. That is why I want to cut it shorter, to make the tree 'fuller'. 

I also want to change the soil and prune the roots, but I think I'm too late for that right now. From what I've read online, it should be done in the springtime and we're already halfway through summer now. Am I correct?

The dentist does have plant-fertilizer there, and I've given it to the tree two times now (in the course of approx 3 months). If necessary, I'm willing to buy a special fertilizer. 

The location of the tree is in the waiting room, next to a big window. It's also right next to the entrance, so during the whole day the door opens and closes and it gets fresh air. There is no direct sunlight, but a lot of natural light. In the winter it's colder (waiting room isn't very warm) and during the summer it's warmer. I believe the tree is experiencing all 4 seasons, but more moderate than it would outside. 

Any help &amp; suggestions on this beautiful tree would be appreciated! I want to make it as healthy as possible, so please help! :)

Edit: I do have some experience with gardening, since we have a pretty big backyard and my dad &amp; I spend a lot of time in it."	t5_2qowd	True

Hi - I'm new to this subreddit and wanted to share my ""bonsai story"" by way of introduction. As you read it I am sure you will find it a bit sensational but I assure you every word is 100% true...

I've been growing bonsai for 5+ years and started like most people do; alone and confused. Friends and family rolled their eyes, laughed behind my back and waited for the phase to fizzle. 

Many dead trees later, I decided I liked the IDEA of bonsai too much to give up, even though I was frustrated and wasn't getting results like I wanted. The guy behind the register at the local bonsai nursery happened to mention he was the president of the local bonsai club and I should come check them out. The next meeting was literally on my birthday. Coincidence?

Everyone seemed friendly enough. I had brought a couple trees I needed to re-pot and showed what I could do. I got some good pointers and tips from various members, but generally people commented that it looked like I knew what I was doing. I was satisfied with that, but also knew I still had a lot to learn. The club was the key, there were obviously some very knowledgeable people there.

A couple months later the Pres had arranged a trip to visit the bonsai garden of some old ""bonsai hermit"" type guy. I asked for the address and phone number and offered to meet the prez there. He said ""sorry"", and explained the guy was something of a hermit with no phone and no email. You couldn't just show up there on your own. So I happily rode with the prez. 

Once there, I was surrounded by about 250 of the absolute best bonsai I had ever seen in person. In a clearing of a pine forest was a roughly circular area surrounding a small shack, dozens of telephone poles were sunk into the ground to varying heights, each capped by a round concrete slab of varying diameter. Upon these pedestals the bonsai were arranged...like some incredible fantasy bonsai stonehenge. I wandered among them for about an hour, utterly in awe of every detail. Every time I asked the price of a tree the bonsai hermit; rail thin, leather skinned, and crazy gypsy hermit scary looking (with a lazy eye, even!) cackled at me, ""that one's not for sale, heh, heh"" over and over ""not for sale"", as if he were mocking me.

Long story short, I did find an incredible azalea and had to have it. The price quoted would make anyone wilt, but I agreed to pay without question. Of course, spooky bonsai hermit guy laughed when I whipped out my plastic. ""Cash only, buddy, ha ha ha!"" - I didn't have enough.

I took out every last dollar I had and handed it to him, (about half the asking price) explaining that's all I had. He asked ""you gonna be at the next meetin?"" I said yes, I planned to. He said ""me too, just bring the rest then."" I said thank you and extended my hand to shake his. He reached out a frail leathery claw towards me and smiled, steel gray eyes probing the depth of my integrity. I looked down at his hand to shake it, and noticed for the first time it was covered with tattoos of lightning bolts down the length of his fingers. I shivered in 85 degree heat.

Fast forward to the next club meeting. This guy was doing a demonstration on air layering. When he was done I asked if he had a minute. He said yes and followed me to a quiet corner. I paid him the remaining $ I owed him, and sheepishly asked if he might need any help at his place. He said, ""sure you can help out if you want, I can't pay ya nothin' but you'll learn a lot.""

From that day until this, I have been his student. I have spent roughly two full days per week during the growing season driving 1.5 hours each way to another *state* to help care for his trees and create my own. I am learning everything this man can teach me from his 40 years of personal and private bonsai practice. While he is still very much a hermit he is also a great friend and teacher. 

Incidentally his family bought him a cell phone last year. He promptly stuck it in his back pocket and I left it be. One day out of the blue he asked me if I would do him a favor and put my number in so if he needed to call me he could. He handed me the phone and I realized I was entering the first name in memory. I guess I was the only person he could imagine wanting to call. That kind of stuff will mess you up if you're not careful.

So I am proud of my bonsai teacher, and everything he has taught me. I cannot summarize it, or paraphrase. The knowledge has simply become a part of who I am, and I do my best to practice what I have learned, but also question and challenge it. 

I'm here because I love bonsai and hope to meet like minded and help those with questions. Maybe have some of my own questions answered, etc.

[Spruce](http://imgur.com/70uNVKX) I just picked up today for $25, it is hard to see in the picture but I think this will make a fantastic little tree in a very short amount of time. [Here](http://imgur.com/GEOYx4G) it is again.

[This](http://imgur.com/fw5pMR2) is [going](http://imgur.com/doOcrwp) to be my [pride] (http://imgur.com/MDuBTAg) and joy. This big japanese maple is about 6 feet tall, with a 6 inch thick trunk. All the branches come off within the first 3 feet of the trunk, the trunk above that is all dead. Because of this, I got it for $90 when it was marked at $370. I am very excited to start playing with this one.

[Cute little cypress](http://imgur.com/XUByUpC) I bought a few days ago as well. It will probably be about 1 foot tall when it is done. It has two main trunks, some good branching (just in need of being cleaned up, badly...) The reason I bought it is that it has some cute little roots that caught my eye seen [here](http://imgur.com/hzB0SS3) I know it isn't perfect material, but I got it on the cheap and think I could make something work.

[Larch](http://imgur.com/8yOyvPe) I bought earlier this year from a nursery. It is about 2 feet tall. Japanese Larch to be more specific, I lost a good amount of the root ball when I dug it out of the nursery, but am pleased to say it is doing very healthily now. Here are the [roots](http://imgur.com/kMLk5dK).

[Red Maple](http://imgur.com/MHcMFvn) that I dug up this spring that was going out of the foundation of my house... It is short, the trunk is only about 5 inches tall due to being hit with the weed whacker several times over the years, and I think with a few more years I could make it have a single full canopy on top of that trunk. [Here](http://imgur.com/CskXVZx) it is again.

I had much more hope for this [hornbeam](http://imgur.com/N2atRsF) last year when I dug it out of my woods. After cutting it back there year and letting it grow, I am losing hope, but I will still find something to do with it.

I have only been doing this for 2 years now, so I am also new, and I know that one thing that holds me back the most is that I am afraid of doing something that will kill my tree. And you know what? Beer alleviates that fear! This little suckers are a lot tougher than you think, and really there is only one way to learn this shit, and that is to try it out yourself. Sure, you could ask r/bonsai for advice, and they may tell you don't do it, but you never really learn your lesson, and you never really learn if maybe your method would work.

Really, if you are questioning something, just try it! If you kill a branch or even the entire tree, well you learned something didn't you? And if you only killed a branch, then woohoo now you get to learn how to deal with a dead branch! It is all a learning process, and from what I have seen on this subreddit newbies are often afraid to try something new because they think killing a tree is a huge deal. It isn't, things die, go buy another one and don't do what you just did again!

Drinking alleviates these thoughts. 

Here is what I just made: [Fuck yeah!](http://imgur.com/fDSNFdM)

He is a Juniper my mother bought for me after I killed my previous one, he was prebonsai stock bought from a trusted vendor, and damn he had a lot of roots. Beer helped me with cutting those to fit the new pot. I am going to try to fill in the top area to make a single layered canopy. Not really a traditional juniper style, but you know what? Fuck it.

That is also soil that I made myself for the first time, pretty proud of that shit. I have about 20 more gallons in the garage, I didn't really realize how much I was making. I think I was drinking when I was making that too...

That is another idea new people need to keep in their minds: ""Fuck it."" You wanna try a type of tree that isn't frequently used or do a style that isn't frequently done in that style? Hey man, if it is what you wanna do then fuck it and give it a shot! Just have a back up plan ready, and probably try on multiple trees at once. It's like shooting a gun, you send enough lead down range you are bound to hit your target sooner or later. Just replace lead with trees. And target with what you want your tree to look like.

Moral of the story, or as you reddit commoners like to say ""**tl:dr**"" : Just try it. What do you have to loose? Normally it is just a $20 tree. And I am tipsy."	t5_2qowd	True

I built this stand for my screened in porch in my apartment.  Thought I'd share.  It receives morning sun all the way until noonish.

by the way, I still love beer.

If my copies were damaged, I would pay current market price without hesitation to replace them.  They're that good.  Should be standard reading for every serious bonsai student.

Close runner-ups for me are: 

* **Bonsai with Japanese Maples** by Peter Adams.  If you grow japanese maples and don't own this book, you're really missing out. Brilliant book.

* **Bonsai Life Histories** by Martin Treasure.  This book shows how a number of gorgeous trees have evolved over the years. 

Other books I often go back to:

* **The Bonsai Workshop** by Herb Gustafson

* **Making Bonsai Landscapes** by Herb Gustafson

* **Bonsai Masterclass** by Peter Chan

* **Complete book of Bonsai** by Harry Tomlinson

* **The Bonsai Survival Manual** by Colin Lewis

I have been a lurker of this sub for quite some time and I am a plant lover/gardener at heart. One thing that I have always wanted to get into was Bonsai, and now is the time. I have been reading tons of info, and like many hobbies there is lots of conflicting info out there. Basically I would just like some direction in how I should start.

Do most people start with a tree from the nursery, or do they get an actual Bonsai? I don't have any Bonsai shops in my area (NY), but I wouldn't be opposed to travel and find one.

Also, I have seen when people buy trees from a nursery, some just let it stay in the gallon pot for the first year, while others take it out and get right to work with repotting and such. Very confusing which way to go.

I will be keeping my tree(s) outside and I am interested in an Azalea bush and also a Japanese Red Maple. Whether these are good starters or not I do not know, but both of these I have experience with in the full grown form and wanted to get them in Bonsai if possible.

Any help is appreciated, thanks so much for all the info and inspiration in this sub so far."	t5_2qowd	True

If not bonsai, it still seems like a way of keeping mother plants compact and beautiful as well as providing a continuous source of cuttings for new full-size plants. I had a few questions though.

Considering they grow so quickly, is there a disadvantage to using chilis as longterm bonsai? I'm worried I won't be able to dwarf the leaves through trimming.

Since chilis bark, I'm excited to develop a thick rootstock during the growing season. Ive heard that trimming back the terminal node helps the truck thicken up by concentrating resources. Is this reasonable?

Since it would be my first tree I didn't want to go overboard with the spending (though am willing to pay for the usual ~$20 for a bonsai tree) I was wondering if it was possible to grab one of those trees that I had found and trim it down to size?

We vote with our purchases, and when we give our money to providers of mallsai we are effectively voting for them to continue their practices, particularly to continue providing the product we have purchased. Two examples: many people opt not to purchase or adopt pets from corporations who purchase from puppy farms, or only buy groceries from sustainable grocers. In both cases the consumer is ""voting"" for both a product they support and the means of providing that product. For each $5 mallsai purchased dozens more can be produced, and our consumption of that product is an incentive for the vendor to continue using the same means (or more harmful means) to provide. Therefore I would urge the bonsai community only to buy from reliable nurseries that create their products in a way you can support, rather than ""rescuing"" a mallsai and giving business to an ignorant vendor.

I've heard that it's best to start with a tree that's a few years old rather than pruning the tree from a seedling.

I received multiple amazon cards for relatives this Christmas, and so I was looking around at stuff there. I'd prefer to use this credit. As I said, college student.

3) Do you think it'd be ok to order one from amazon, or should I go to a nursery or something and just cough up some cash? Would a tree ship well at all?

Here is his life story:

I've always really liked bonsais and I wanted to start to get into them so I asked for one of the amazon junipers for Christmas, but my dad managed to find a nursery and I found this guy under the Christmas tree.  After Christmas break I left him home with my mom so that I didn't kill him at college and he was doing just fine. Come spring I met a few Landscape Architects majors, one was even dual majoring in horticulture and they said they could help keep my tree alive if I bring it to school (it's no fun having a tree that you can't see), so I had been keeping it on my shelf during the night as it was still getting cold, (I live in north Kingstown, Rhode island) an then bringing him outside and sitting him on my patio during the day. He was doing fine, but got some mites (you could see the little webs and black dots on some of the needles). I used my mom's alcohol soap and water mixture that she uses to kill bugs on her orchids to get rid of them and he seemed to bounce back.  One particularly windy day he fell off the ledge, or I must have had him only half on there :( I scooped up all the dirtish/gravel mixture that the nursery had him in and plopped him back in. as you can see I wasn't able to get all of it and now part of his root ball is exposed. He came home a few day's later as the semester ended and he's been back on the edge of the coffee table in front of some large windows (as seen in the pictures), he's looking real bad now though and thatâ€™s where he had been all winter without a problem. I've been making sure to water him whenever the top of his soil gets dry, about twice a week and I don't see any more bugs on him. His new growth is still doing well, but the rest of him has gotten really brown. Any ideas why? What should I do to save him? I know heâ€™s an outdoor plant but since he had been doing better inside with my momâ€™s care than outside with mine I thought it was better.

tldr; Juniper bonsai browning, no idea why or what to do. HELP!

1330722033.0	qeyyh	Update: Dormroom tree	crisbo	15	3	3	"Hey everyone. Around 4 months ago I posted about a little juniper I bought online ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/comments/ltrxm/a_juniper_i_bought_online/)). Just thought I'd give an update since it's still alive! I ended up taking it home to New Jersey over thanksgiving break and leaving it outside until late January when I came back to school. The tips of a bunch of the branches turned a dull green/yellow color during that time and I thought the tree was dying, but that's gone away in the last couple weeks and there are even new buds sprouting all over! So while it's really not ideal to have this tree indoors, I think I'm doing okay, at least for now.

Just to summarize some of the conditions, I have it under three 26-watt CFLs, which are on from when I get up in the morning (8-9 am) to when I go to bed (around 12 am). I water every 3-4 days (how long it takes for the soil to dry) and the temperature is consistently around 70 degrees.

So, I've recently grown a small fascination with growing redwood Bonsais, and am interested in achieving something like this:

Can this be achieved by growing these from seeds or do I need to buy ""cuttings""? I'm currently 23, so hopefully by the time I'm 50 I'll have a beautiful Bonsai grove to show for.

One of the fukiens had a funky twist and sexy taper, along with primary branches in perfect spots, so I looked forward to it recovering and working on it. It struggled for the rest of the summer, all winter and this past spring. The whole time I thought it was a goner but I refused to toss it in the trash. About 3 months ago I moved it from the greenhouse to avoid higher temps and give it full sun, and about a month ago I moved it into partial shade. It seemed to have one leaf budding at the time, after being bald for so long. Last weekend I went looking for it and couldn't find it outside. That's because I was looking for a bald tree that is instead now covered in new growth! Waiting paid off.

I'll share a photo shortly.

Here's a link to an album - http://imgur.com/a/ktafz

I noticed that most the branches appeared to be dying off while new shoots were coming in. Because of this, I decided to chop all the old branches and let the new ones come out and thrive. They look okay. 

My problem with the soil is that when I water the plant, a lot of water sort of sits at the top and doesn't find it's way through the soil. I ordered some new soil (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009TRITS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and hope to do work there. But I'm very open to suggestions because at this point..

How do the bonsai exhibitions work? Is there prize money involved, or is it 'merely' to advertise what you have for sale?
I realise that some pro's take on apprentices, who pay them for a spot in their nursery or workplace, but that seems like larger operations rather than a one man thing.
