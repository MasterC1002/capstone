It's a power/endurance sport, kids.  That means around 80% of the output the athlete generates in a 2k race comes from the aerobic systems in the body.  Those systems are best build by (guess what) steady state!  Hours and hours of it.  

I know it's boring.  It's boring to coach steady state.  But you have to do it.  There's no dodging or getting out of it.  If you're hurt, bike it.  But if you're healthy, stop trying to dodge it.

1349807753.0	117i43	The grand erg test thread	Casemander	98	8	36	"With the onset of the fall season, there have been a lot of questions popping up about 2k and 5k tests. Everything from music and mental prep to stroke rates and goal setting has appeared, and a **lot** of these questions are repeats and reposts. This is a great community, but it's not quite 2.5k members strong, and I'm afraid that a lot of these questions will go unanswered. A few months ago I put together [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/xofva/regarding_all_of_the_posts_about_starting_rowing/) which was pretty popular, so hopefully this will get a similar response. With that said, this is a work in progress, so please chime in if you think there's something I should add or change.



So, you're a novice, or maybe an experiences rower, and you're maybe a month or two into your season. You've been on the water a lot, you're feeling fit, and then after Friday practice, your coach says those four dreaded words: ""Erg tests next week"".

Immediately a shadow is cast over your weekend. Your palms start to sweat and you're having trouble breathing. ""Life is over,"" you ponder. ""I will never know joy again."" But then you remember Casemander's helpful erg test thread, and you realize there is hope left yet.

the test is on Monday, giving you the weekend to prep. You're really looking to PR this season, so you decide to forego getting absolutely wasted tonight or tomorrow to make sure you're at your best. Considering most rowers (that I know, at least) get stupid drunk and have too much fun whenever possible, what's a guy or gal to do with all their free time?

**YOUR BODY**

First of all, eat right and sleep right. You're a rower, so your intake isn't a problem, but considering you want to be primed come Monday afternoon it might be a good idea to skip the ice cream and fried chicken. Eat lean, get your colors and your carbs, drink water, and eat ENOUGH. Don't starve yourself or anything like that, if anything eat a little bit too much during the weekend, because Monday you'll a. want to have an empty-ish stomach for your piece and b. probably be too jumpy and amped to get a square meal in anyway. If practice is at 4, eat light all day, keep drinking water, and stop eating anything substantive two or so hours before your piece. In terms of sleep, just don't be a fool, and get enough. Sleep in Saturday if you can, nap, get 6-8 hours the night before your piece. This isn't rocket science; your body is a machine, make sure it's well oiled before you test it. Along those lines, don't be afraid to do a *light* erg piece or go for an easy jog the day before you piece; it's good to stay loose, and your body will not punish you for it.

**YOUR MUSIC**

There are literally over ten thousand threads in this subreddit about erg music. Obviously, this is a highly personal choice, and your coach might not even let you listen to music while you test. However, here are some of my favorites, as well as a bunch that others have posted in erg music threads. Note: I took music from the top few comments in the music threads I could find, and the results were... varied. Here are some:

I'll be the first to admit that I'm more of a hip hop / electronic music guy, so I the rock / metal section's a little threadbare. Just do what I did and use the search function, it can be really helpful.

**YOUR MIND**

Okay, so you're physically ready to go, and you've got a killer playlist. What else? You need to be mentally prepared for a piece. They say sports are 90% mental, and that's doubly true for rowing. You're literally willing yourself through pain on an erg. You're not even going anywhere. That said, this is my two cents on how to mentally prepare. 

* **Have a plan, and stick to it**. It keeps you motivated, keeps you on track, and importantly it breaks up a daunting task (holy shit I have to erg 5000 meters) into a few reasonable ones (5 by 1k? Okay.). Know what splits you want, when you want them, and how to appropriately react to less-than-ideal circumstances. In other words, take as much control over your piece as you can.

* **Focus on doing, not what needs to be done.** By that I mean don't worry about that next 500 meters, or how you're going to need to hold a 1:32 average over your last 250 to PR. That's in the future, and right now it doesn't exist. You have erging to do right now- get to it. For example, it's much more effective to tell yourself ""okay, holding a 1:48, nice and steady. Keep it up, self"" than to say ""damn, this 1:48 is killing me... and I still have 1200m left. Shit."" This only serves to stress you out and take the focus away from the work at hand, which could slow you down, which would make you more stressed. Don't think; react. Do.

* **Remove the word 'failure' from your vocabulary.** Sometime in your rowing career, you will have a shit piece. You will go into it feeling confident and invincible, and you will miss a PR by twenty seconds. When this happens, you have two options: you can let that piece defeat you and frustrate you, or you can use that piece to make you faster. The only mistakes are those you don't learn from. This holds true to rowing, as well. So you had a bad piece: you also just got in an incredible workout. Look at your splits; did you fly and die? Were your legs a little tight? Did you not warm up enough? Are you hydrated? Were you mentally prepared for your piece? There is always a reason, or reasons, why you do or do not PR. Understand them, and use this knowledge to inform your strategy for your next piece.

User smokebathsalts also had some really good things to say about stress:

&gt;Cannot emphasis enough how important it is to not stress out too much over erg tests. Going into a test with a head full of anxiety and panic is just about the worst thing you can do, and since I stopped doing that my PRs have dropped steadily. That's anecdotal, but I'm sure someone will agree with me, and it's been pretty well documented that stress (especially to the level most rowers experience it before a test) negatively impacts performance.


**RACE STRATEGY**

Okay, so there are two main tests, at least here in the U.S., and a few lesser-known tests. In the fall you'll be doing mostly 5k pieces (6k's being a lesser-utilized option) and in the spring you'll be testing with 2k pieces (or 2.5k). For shits and giggles you might do a 10k as well, but that's not used nearly as much as an erging benchmark. Here's a rundown on strategy for each basic piece.

* *The 5k and 6k*

A big thanks to Clyde_Frag for starting off the discussion on these longer pieces.
&gt;For longer type pieces, it is incredibly important to make sure you are breathing properly. Focus on sitting up at the catch so that air can fill your lungs and then exhale at the finish. Remember to drive with the legs and accelerate through to the release. It can be easy to forget your rowing form while doing an erg test, and while rowing well is a lot more important on the water than on the erg, you cannot forget the fundamentals of the rowing stroke.
&gt;
&gt;When it gets hard and you start getting to a dark place (which it inevitably will if you are pushing yourself the right way) just focus on getting to the next 500 meter marker. When you are in extreme pain and you still have 2500 meters left to go in your 6k test, it can be incredibly helpful to break your test up into pieces. In my experience while doing 6k tests I have come to expect a large amount of pain somewhere between 3-2k left to go, but it doesn't really get worse after that. If I can hang on until 1k left to go at the split I want, chances are that I will have a nice PR. Don't be scared of the pain. Take solace in the fact that you are over coming your body's mental barriers by erg testing.

In addition to that, a popular and proven strategy for these pieces is to ""neutral split"" until the final thousand meters or so. This strategy involves quickly settling into your base pace, holding it for the bulk of the piece, and then dropping your splits over the last thousand or so until your sprint. Often, dropping splits mid-piece can be unsustainable, and there is nothing worse psychologically than watching your splits creep up past your target with a lot of distance left. Preparation and pacing are key for these pieces. A good base stroke rate will put you between 24 and 30 strokes per minute, although 26-28 is more common.

* *The 2k and 2.5k*

These pieces are much quicker and arguably much more intense than 5ks and 6ks. In these situations, negative splitting, or dropping your average split throughout the piece, is often encouraged. That said, these pieces are also so short that you're going to be dropping your split soon enough anyway, although it is possible to neutral split these as well. Relative to other pieces, the average rower's 500m split for a 2k should be between 5 and 7 seconds faster for a 2k than a 5k or 6k. Stroke rate is also higher, in the 30-34 range and possibly even higher.

* *The 10k and 30 minute piece*

These pieces are generally not used for the purposes of formal testing, but instead as fitness tests. These tests are long; between half an hour and forty-five minutes. Aside from boredom, your body starts to hurt, and it takes a lot more mental fortitude to finish these pieces well. It really comes down to your resolution to finish a piece out well.

**EDIT:** Added some more information about race strategy and mental preparation. If anyone wants to chime in about these or offer more piece-specific info, don't hesitate to comment or PM me and I'll update accordingly. This also goes for any other aspect of the post."	t5_2qljq	True

"	jcastro20111	92	17	14	"Just my experience during a 2k piece.

Heart's raceing, a little jittery... not sure if its because of the competition or because you know what the next 6 1/2 minutes is going to do you. You are on the seat knees bent arms extended looking at the monitor in front of you. The 3/4 catch position trying to be perfectly still.

You see ""Attention"" on the monitor in front of you, and your heart a bit more, take that last deep breath and then see ""ROW"".

You pull as hard as you can, and as your seat moves up you see 2:34 on the screen, another pull on the chain and a 2:04, a third pull and the display reads 1:41... You think much better but not where I need to be. After a 1:32, and a 1:28, you see a 1:21 on the readout and you are thrilled.

At the corner of the screen you see that you have 1933 meters to go and the voice of your coxswain says calmly... time to settle. Part of you wants to keep pulling 1:21's because it feels so easy right now, but what reason you have left in you wins out, so you take what seems like forever in the recovery of the next stroke. Your rate is down to a 35. Another super slow recovery, and your rate and your split are right on target 27 beats per minute with a 500m split of 1:35.

Next thing you know, you spot the corner of your screen and see you have 1850-some meters to go, but they are scrolling by so damn slowly. You hear your coxswain reminding you, ""2 breaths per stroke"", as you begin feeling heat eminating from your quadraceps. You don't want to do the math, but your brain does it anyway ""7 1/2 % into this thing is too early to feel like this"". You quickly dismiss that feeling as quickly as you can and you start getting into the new rhythm of 2 breaths per stroke.

At first its a bit awkward, but sucking in o2 as quickly as you can at the catch and blowing it out slowly during the drive, and then suck it in quickly as your arms are coming out and absorbing doing your best to absorb as much of it as you can on the recovering before blowing it out and doing it again.

Your eyes are fixed on that that split. 1:35, 1:36, 1:36, 1:37, and then panic sets in and you give it an extra push 1:33. Your coxswain tells you, watch your split, don't overcorrect, and you find that grove again at 1:35. You look up and you see 1377 meters to go. You think to yourself ""A third, less than a third, more than a third?"" Your math skills are slipping, but it doesn't matter, you feel like you have been on that machine forever and all you want to do is stop. 

The 1:21 that seemed so easy just a couple of minutes ago seems like an impossible feat right now. You find your splits slipping more and more. You decide to bring it up a beat. The next stroke you rush the slide a little more than you probably should, and the stroke rate shoots up to a 32, a couple of more strokes and you are back in control... again pulling 1:34-1:35 at 29 strokes per minute.

You scan the top distance block on the monitor and you watch it as the number counts down from 4 digits to 3 digits. Half way. ""A little more than half way since I'm not counting the sprint as part of the piece"", anything to make this thing seem like its going to end earlier. 

Your quadraceps are on fire at this point. Doesn't take much imagination to picture each muscle fibre glowing red like the heating element of an electric stove. ""Only 100 more strokes"" you hear your coxswain tell you... that doesn't really help.

Your split is slipping again... seeing more 1:36's than 1:35's in there. You think to yourself, ""power 10, and concentrate on the legs on 2"", you count 2 strokes and then count out the next 10 strokes in your head and concentrate on just telling your legs to push. ""One.... Two... Three.... Four.... "" looking at the split and seeing you are back in control. You also notice that your rate has popped up to about 30. Your coxswain is saying something but you don't hear him and keep counting to yourself, ""Five.... SIx.... Seven... Eight.... Nine... Ten..."" You are back at 1:34 and have just crossed the 500m to go mark. 

""25 more strokes before my sprint!"" Trying to stay in control and counting 10 strokes, then another 10 strokes, you look up and see 293 left to go and think to yourself, ""GO NOW!"". In the span of a single stroke you move from 30 strokes per minute to 45. Your see the split drop to 1:30, then to 1:29, then the sweat in your eyes gets so bad you close them. You can hardly breathe, but you are still counting out each stroke. After ten of them you manage to open your eyes and see that you have 212 meters to go and your split is a 1:28 you count out another 10. You feel like your legs are not liking you. Your peek reveals that your split has slipped to a 1:31 and all you can make out is the 1 followed by 2 other changing digits in the distance block. ""Another 20 strokes should do it"" you tell yourself, and proceed to count out another 10 and then another. On the second you are squinting your eyes, looking at the distance block and then numbers changing. When you reach stroke 10, you make out that the first of 2 digits left in that block has changed to 1, so you count out your last three strokes, ""one... two.. three"" and then take a couple of light pulls of the chain because you are not supposed to stop cold after going so hard, but after the second pull, you just reach and stick the handle down."	t5_2qljq	True

There is something unimaginable in the sport of rowing - it cannot be described, it cannot be taught, it must be explored through experience.  There is something about gliding quietly across the water at five in the morning that subconsciously satisfies the very depths of the soul.  Peace is found during morning practice, shared only with eight other teammates, the rising sun, and the silence.  There is something about the repetition of the stroke; catch, pull through, release - that exposes the mind to a higher level of placidity found nowhere else.

There is something about pushing yourself farther than you can go, until you feel ready to collapse, and then pulling that last five hundred harder than any before.  There is something cleansing to the being in all the sweat and tears and blood that pour out over the course of a season.  Nowhere else can such a rollercoaster of emotions be felt; adrenaline at the start, exhilaration during the sprint, fear at the necessity of another PR, sadness at the loss of oarsmen, frustration at every obstacle that rears itself.  In no other sport is such a chaotic control present.  Quick hands, quick body, slow slide; all eight oars in at the perfect time.

In no other sport is the word TEAM so meaningful as in crew.  Together in a shell, eight oars and eight sliding seats act as bindings -s troke to seven, seven to six, six to five...all the way to the bow.  One rower's demon haunts the entire boat; perfection in one oarsman means nothing.  A set boat and solid row is achieved solely when eight minds think identically, eight bodies melt together to form one machine.

One mistake can cost a race; one stray thought from the goal can cause a dream to die.  Yet somehow, the end is always reached, the destination is always found, only to become a challenge again the next day.  Never are you the best; never are you the worst.  We are all floating somewhere in the middle fighting to take the number one slot at any given time.

You see, it's not about winning or losing.  It's about competition with yourself - going out there to do your very best, to give it your all, to have nothing left.  It's about supporting your teammates, pulling for them when you have all but lost faith in yourself.  Crew is a sport that demands all of these things.  It is not a sport of fame; it is not a sport of popularity.  Rowing is above all that.  Rowing is a sport of purity and strength, constantly made better by you and I."	t5_2qljq	True

1344103403.0	xofva	Regarding all of the posts about starting rowing	Casemander	60	3	35	"There have been a lot of questions lately in this subreddit about whether or not some people should start rowing. I'm by no means an expert on the sport, but I do row competitively at the collegiate level, and here are my two cents.

First and foremost, rowing is a labor of love. People do it for a lot of reasons, but aside from Olympic coverage it's a sport that (in the U.S. at least) goes largely unnoticed by the rest of the world. It's entirely amateur, and if you're thinking of picking up a sport for money and fame, this isn't it. On the flip side of this, however, is an incredible community of athletes, coaches, and supporters, who for the most part are surprisingly approachable and kind. Unlike in other sports, coaches might spend the mornings with Elites, the afternoons with high schoolers, and the evenings with Masters. Likewise, I once found myself rowing behind Mike Wherley, a three time World Champion, who was at the boathouse and decided to come out with us. The point I'm trying to make is that rowing has very little pretense. Of course you get individuals and teams with big egos, but athletes and coaches alike commit to rowing because of a passion for it, and this commonality really unifies the community.

**What can I expect from the sport?**

A lot of hard work. Especially in the winter / off water months, you'll primarily be [erging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_rower), supplemented with weight training, other forms of cardio, and maybe some technique work in rowing tanks. In the spring, summer, and fall, you'll be on the water as much as possible. Speaking as an American rower, the fall season is a few head-style races (kind of similar to a cross country race) that are about 5 kilometers long; it's a season for building endurance, aerobic ability, and some strength. The winter will be about gearing up for the spring sprint season, where you'll be racing 2 kilometer sprints (like a 100m dash) against 1-5 other boats. Faster races than the fall, and in my opinion more exciting: the spring season is what counts most, and 2k's are the standard length of collegiate and international racing (iirc, high school races are 1500m).

**Am I too young/old/short/tall/fat/skinny/etc. to row?**

NO. Anyone telling you otherwise is a liar and a scoundrel. People seem to think that if you're under 6'8'' and 220 lbs. of pure muscle there's no way you can row competitively. Jason Reed is small by heavyweight rowing standards,  6', and sat in the bow seat of the 2004 Men's Heavyweight 8+ that won gold in Athens, in a sport dominated by guys who are 6'2'' and above. Greg Searle retired for *nine years* before picking up the sport again, and he just won a bronze medal in GB's 8+. Steve Redgrave won five gold medals at as many Olympiads, retiring at the ripe old age of 38. What these athletes share is more than talent: it's grit and determination. If you want it, go for it. And if you really, truly, are terrible? Well, you've learned what it means to push yourself to a limits. You know yourself that much better, and on top of that you've met an incredible group of friends who you will be close with for a very long time, those being your teammates. Plus, there is a REASON we have lightweights, and it's a class of it's own. The worst thing you can do, if you're interested in rowing, is not at least try it out.

**But everyone at the club is going to be better than me! I'm a freshman in college, that MUST be too old to learn how to row!**

Actually, many, if not most rowers (Again, from a U.S. standpoint) start their careers in college. It's like poker, sort of: it takes five minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master. A rowing stroke is pretty simple: you catch, drive, and recover. That's it. In the bigger boats, you even have someone to tell you what to do, lest you forget. Many rowers played other sports before coming to crew, but it's certainly not a prerequisite. You'd be surprised; talk to a coach. Above all, it's a sport that rewards hard work and commitment. If you have that, you will be a successful rower.

**But I don't want to be a burden on the team- I did a 500m test, and it was beyond terrible.**

If you want to row, row. You WILL improve. You might never be ""fast"", but you can always get better. I would much rather see a guy in the third varsity boat get a new personal record and black out than watch someone in the first boat casually pull a time ten seconds faster not trying. I, most rowers, and all coaches I've met respect how difficult this sport is for everyone, and how everyone's goals and achievements are different. It's about winning and being the best you can be *first*; the gold comes later.

Anyway, my two cents. Feedback welcome, I hope this helps anyone new thinking about joining.

1347389044.0	zpzrl	Welcome to all the new rowers here. Can i just have a quick word about erg times. 	Honey-Badger	56	5	53	"Great that you guys have become interested in our ridiculous sport since the olympics, welcome to our brother/sisterhood of overly competitive athletes. A lot of you have just started to use the dreaded erg for the first time, you may of had a go a few times in your local gym but that doesn't count. People on ergs in local gyms aren't 'erging', saying they are is like saying darts is a sport.

So back to my point, erg times aren't relevant when you're just starting out. Theres no point in posting your stats and saying ""i got x time, what should i be getting?' you shouldn't have a set time to get. What you should be doing is more ergs and doing better every time. You are your only competition right now, beat the guy you were yesterday and tomorrow you can beat the guy you are today. 

As for tips for getting better: do more ergs, eat more food. "	t5_2qljq	True

If you're rowing for a country with no rowing program, however, then that's just the reality you face and it's what happened to Gerald Ssemambo at the 2012 games.

Most of us take for granted our access to coaching, boats, and ergs, but rowers in some places aren't so lucky. Gerald is in Uganda, his erg has no monitor and he coached himself using YouTube videos. Despite this, he was able to qualify for the 2013 World Rowing Championship, which is pretty cool. At the championships, however, he's competing against teams with a lot more money and access to top notch coaching staff, not to mention ergs that actually have monitors.

A rowing non-profit called ""It's Bigger Than You"" has an indiegogo campaign to raise $5,000 for Gerald so that he can afford lodging and equipment. The founder of It's Bigger Than You will be traveling to coach Gerald in preparation for the World Rowing Championship in Korea and they're currently working with US Rowing to try to get him access to some training facilities.

The goal is to give Gerald a more level playing field; to ensure that he has the opportunity to perform his best at the competition and to focus the race on athleticism, not who has the best equipment to train with.

If you want to read more about Gerald, there's a page about him here:

By now, all of us have likely viewed the horrific devastation in Oklahoma caused by tornados over the past two days. We at USRowing feel a particular tie to the community because of our affiliation with the Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation and the Oklahoma City National High Performance Center. Our friends in the Oklahoma City rowing community were mostly spared from these events. The boathouses and riverfront remain unscathed.
 
The community south of the Boathouse District has been devastated.
 
Several in the rowing community have contacted USRowing to ask how they can help. The OKCBF has initiated a fundraising effort to support disaster relief and we would like to invite you to join us in supporting this effort by making a donation online. All proceeds benefit the American Red Cross.

1365608779.0	1c2hbv	Last 2k test before championships, big improvement. What I did differently.	last500	38	2	32	"Skip to ""results"" at the bottom if you just want to see my time. I did a healthy amount of introspection about why this went so well as I continue to try to optimize my training and strategy.

Really happy with how this went. It was a big jump off my [previous one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/191cbn/nice_way_to_kick_off_the_weekend/). I changed up a few things for this test and I thought I'd share some elements of my prep and strategy in case anyone can benefit from it.

**Caffeine**: I first did this in [January](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/179tv9/caffeine_and_testing_a_report/). I took about 345 mg of caffeine 60 minutes before the start of my test, 3.9 mg per kg of body mass.

**Lactate**: after trying this a couple races ago I decided to try it for the test. 4 [sportlegs](http://www.sportlegs.com/what/what.asp) supplements an hour beforehand. I can't tell if it made a difference or not during the test but my legs did seem to hurt a lot less than normal a few hours afterwards.

**Decongestant**: for whatever reason I've had a lot of problems with nasal and sinus congestion this year and have had trouble managing it. Especially with pre-race nerves and dry mouth from caffeine, I often start gagging on mucus, to the point where I actually threw up a little bit 10 minutes before my previous 2k test. I chose CVS brand ""non-drowsy non-drying sinus PE"" which has 400mg of Guaifenesin (an expectorant) per dose and 10mg of Phenylephrine HCl (a nasal decongestant). I took it about an hour before testing and it helped quite a bit.

*Edit to clarify: all supplements I took were legal, NCAA and WADA allowed, within acceptable restricted amounts.*

**Warmup**: I've used [this strategy](http://athletesbooks.com/how-to-do-a-great-2k-erg-test/) with success in the past. I broke a good sweat over the course of the warmup and felt very energized and ready to go. My only modification from previous times was that I removed all static stretching from my warmup after reading that it harms your performance.

**Test Strategy**: followed the test guidelines in the warmup strategy and executed it exactly how I planned.

*Start*: 3 quick strokes, 5 power strokes, 10 stroke settle to base. Executed exactly as planned. On the last power stroke I hit 16 splits below my final average which was pretty on-point.

*Base*: On my previous test I based around 1:34-1:35 at 33spm. I had a lot of energy left for the sprint which to me meant that I could have gone harder through the middle. Goal for today was 1:32-1:33 at 34spm. As far as I know it's most effective to hold consistently and not take any power moves through the middle, so I allowed myself rate shifts if my split started to creep up. Around 800 in I started to struggle and shifted up to a 36 which I held until the sprint.

*Sprint*: At 300 to go I shifted up but I was in a lot of pain. It was everything I could do to bring the rate up just 1 beat and didn't drop my split very much. At 200 I let loose but my quads and hamstrings were starting to give out. I was holding about a 38 and technique went out the window, I was yanking hard with the arms and body to compensate for my legs. I don't completely remember but I think I was hitting 1:31 but in the last 50 meters started to creep up to 1:33-1:34. I didn't take a last quick stroke at the end and probably cost myself a couple tenths there. Overall I'm still happy with it because I did manage to hold below my overall average for the piece.

**Psychology**: Admittedly I wasn't feeling on top of my game mentally. I had a pretty busy and stressful week beforehand, pulled an all-nighter for school 2 nights before, and didn't get enough sleep the night before. I was nervous especially because I'd woken up late that morning and was very congested and had swollen lymph nodes. However, that all evaporated once I got to practice and started warming up. I listened to my normal pump-up playlist and was feeling pretty good at the start. During the piece I distinctly remember thinking to myself ""I've got this, I'm going to do it"" about 800 in.

**Results**:
http://i.imgur.com/RKAraQB.jpg

I'm 20, male (obviously), 198cm and 89.3 kg. According to my calculations I averaged at 35.8 spm, a big jump from my 34.6 last time.

**Looking forward**:
I still have a lot of room to improve on my sleep habits and could do better with my pre-race nutrition. My supplement strategy worked very well, I may add more caffeine next time but don't foresee any more major changes. Warmup was spot on as well, but next time I plan to arrive earlier and extend it by 5 minutes to get in a couple more 10s before cooling down.

As for the test itself, I was right where I wanted to be at this point in time. I talked to my coach and he didn't see much reason to take my rate any higher than it already is, so I plan to continue with my 34-36 base strategy, possibly trying to max it out at a 36 through the whole base next time. I'm going to add more short to medium interval sprint workouts and start to get comfortable working below 1:30 for extended periods and repeated intervals. I also will continue to work on my sprint to be more effective with bringing the rate up and continuing to apply power through the line. In particular I want to work on holding that last 100 and develop the habit of shortening up and making a final push in around 20m to go to run out the clock. Every tenth counts and I don't want to lose any time in the future in the last 10-20m."	t5_2qljq	True

I personally knew Greg. He was a great, funny guy who loved rowing and was passionate about the sport.

He ended his life last night. I can only begin to imagine the thoughts that were going through his mind before everything ended for him. Several friends I have spoken to have said everything seemed pretty normal up until the past week or so.

That said, I've seen a lot of posts of people asking what their 2K times should be and I don't understand why they don't just row one to find out. Regardless of what their target 2K time should be, the time they turn in is going to be what it is. The erg doesn't care if you need to hit a certain time to qualify for something.

I can understand tapering to put in your very best time like at a CRASH-B but going into an event you should already know your approximate finish time so you can properly pace, no? So shouldn't you have already done some 2K pieces in preparation already?

**Edit**: OK, so the moral of the story is that doing an actual 2K full bore is excruciating and there are people who would literally rather run a marathon for hours than pull their brains out for a few minutes. The agony of a 2K test is something which I have evidently never experienced but am working toward. There are also other mitigating factors regarding 2K's such as having to taper. And despite other sports finding benefit in practicing the actual race format, rowing a 2K, even at less than 100%, is so unlike other tasks in sports that going through a trial run ahead of time is just not done. All very interesting. Thanks everyone for their input."	t5_2qljq	True

I'm pretty new to Reddit, but friends have been urging me to check it out. I recently made a movie about rowing called “Backwards,” and saw that there have been some conversations about it on here already so I wanted to get your feedback. 

This was my first feature film, and I wrote the script, acted in, and produced the movie.  It has been receiving mixed reviews so far, so I thought I would come to the Reddit community for some honest feedback.  

I was a rower in high school and college and think that rowing is a beautiful sport.  I tried to make the movie as authentic as possible.  

I'll answer questions for the next couple hours while I am still in Boston waiting for my plane back to NYC. 

You can ask here or on /r/IAMA I'll answer on both: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10md0f/iama_i_am_actress_sarah_megan_thomas_here_from/

She has 8 broken ribs, shattered pelvis, broken clavicle, 7 broken leg bones, fractured neck vertebrae, brain damage, destroyed neck artery, necessitating surgery and long-term rehabilitation. She does NOT have health insurance. Every aspect of this debilitating tragic accident is costly. Her healing process will be long and complicated; not only financially, but mentally and emotionally. We are doing our best to help helping her in her daily fight to just live life. We need financial help. We need help to cover her medical treatments estimated at $250,000 USD. Any additional funds will be applied to travel expenses and follow up treatments. From the bottom of our hearts we thank you.""

She gets 8 minutes off every hour, and is attempting to go for 26 hours. At the time of this post she has been going for 14 hours. She is also attempting to break the record for most km erged in 24 hours. It would be great if she could get a little attention for this!

About Becky: Becky is an incredible person. She has been diagnosed with a mild form of Cerebral Palsy, which affects some of her speech and mild motor functions but she doesn't allow it to slow her down in the slightest. She is currently one of the fastest rowers on her US college team, Eastern Michigan University. She is also one of the kindest and most genuine person you can meet. I am so proud of her, and want /r/rowing to be proud of her too.

Edit: she is now finished! Becky erged for 25 hours straight, and beat the world record for longest erg by a woman!"	t5_2qljq	True

For me it would have to be being labelled as a rower. For some reason, this girl introduces me to everyone in the following way... ""This is Sam, He's a rower"" *cue false interest*

There's something awfully tedious about explaining to people that I've only just met why I don't have 'massive arms' and being reminded just how 'easy' rowing must be.

So reddit, let's hear some of yours!

1352382377.0	12utjp	We flipped our 4 today. Check your oarlocks before rowing!	huzzakawah	30	7	19	"Today was our last practice for the season, and we were practicing for Frostbit/Braxton this weekend.

Our 4 was doing a 12 minute piece, when 2 launches passed by us, waking us on port, and then the guy behind me's oar came out of the lock. I'm guessing he didn't tighten it enough.

We were in a bow loader and our cox decided to jump out when we were tipping a bit. Bad idea? Of course.

Anyway, now we're all in the water, and our cox and the rower behind me can't swim. So they're hopelessly grabbing on to the boat. Luckily there were two other boats ahead of us and a launch. They came over to us quickly. 

The temperature outside: 26 degrees Fahrenheit. We got back to the boathouse which luckily had hot showers and our entire crew ready to help us out. This was about an hour and a half ago. We're all fine, just a little cold.

So the lesson is to always check the hardware before you row, or you're going to be in a very cold river.

This pretty much applies to every rower.  You are not a special snowflake... unless you row adaptive... then you won't be doing a 2K anyways.

**What are the standards*

Look on the sidebar under 'Erg Times' - there are two great documents with erg scores for all weight classes, ages and genders.  That will give you an idea of where you should be.  

**What split should I pull*

I see this question way too much so I am going to give you a ""secret"" (protip: it's not) workout to do 2-3 days before your erg test.  I've done it, I've given it to my rowers, my team does it and I've seen other coaches do it.

* 6x500m with 2-3' rest (no more).

Go as hard as you can.  The average of these 6 pieces is a good aproximator of what you can pull during your erg test.  

Make sure you do a light steady state workout between these and your erg test.  It is not advised to do it the day before, or same day of your test.

**What's a good race plan**

A nice simple plan, this is going to be different for everyone but here what I do.

* Sprint your first 100-150m, these are free, go hard. 
* Settle to your split average, hold it, do not allow it to rise.
* Keep rowing
* With ~300m to go (aka 1 minute) start bringing your split down and start your sprint.  You can do anything for 1 minute.

**How do I train to get better at them**

* Lots and lots of volume (steady states)
* Good sleep and recovery
* More volume
* good nutrition
* more volume"	t5_2qljq	True

Just open the iTunes Store and click on Redeem (near the bottom of the page if you're on an iPhone, upper-right corner if you're on a computer) and type in one of the codes. If you like it PLEASE do me a huge favor and leave a review on the App Store, or at least a star rating--I don't have a huge audience yet and so each review really makes a difference.

I created Meters in my spare time after one summer when I went home from college and I was erging in my high school boathouse's erg room. I always used my iPod touch for music, but since there was no wifi at the boathouse, I had to write down my times and get on the computer at home to record them on my Concept2 logbook. I want Meters to be the best tool for recording workouts from your iOS device so if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. I do have a lot of features planned for future versions already but since I already have a full time job I don't have a lot of time to work on the app.

I won't get any karma for this post so I'd appreciate upvotes to spread the word about my app. If it's popular I can also post more promo codes.

Here's my blog where you can read more about meters:

Let's just call this rower ""Bob"". Bob is in his 4th spring season of rowing and is a junior in high school. He has a decent erg score and is, but isn't really the best technical rower on the team. The whole season, another rower named ""Jacob"" was at stroke seat. We were doing great. All of a sudden, 2 seat rips his achilles tendon and is out for the season, so we put the next best available rower in his seat. We go like this for 2-3 weeks and 2 seat shows back up and is cleared by the doctor to row. 

Now, 2 seat and ""Bob"" really have not been too fond of eachother because of the fact that ""Bob"" thinks he is the ""team leader"" and 2 seat doesn't care. So when the time comes for him to get back in the boat, our coach won't give him the seat race to get back in. 2 seat is out of the picture for the season. 

Bob is trying to row for the U.S. Naval Academy. His father had told our coach that and also told our coach that he thinks his son should be at stroke seat. Well, the next practice, we switch stroke seats with Bob and Jacob. Jacob is 6'2"", while Bob is 5'10"". Jacob is pulling a significantly faster 2k than Bob and can row 2x as good as he can. We do our first piece with Bob and it is complete SHIT. We went from great keel to chimpanzees holding oars. There is no length and we are much, much slower than what we used to be.

This is where the politics come in.

Our coach finds it to be just fine and sends us to the regatta for the weekend. The boats we were beating by at least 2 lengths were holding us off for the entire race. It was ridiculous. 

I get home from the regatta and I talk to my parents who had been standing with the rest of the teams parents at the stands. They had heard Bobs dad talking about how great the boat looked compared to other regattas now that his son is stroking and that 2 seat is out of the boat. By the way Bob and his father acts, it is completely obvious that he is politicing the team.

TL;DR: Rowers father is screwing the rest of my boat just to benefit his son by brown nosing our coach.

I'm primarily interested in hearing from anyone who actually sets their drag factor before a 2K test to see why you use the value that you do and if you did any experimenting with other drag factors which led you to choose the one that you use.

Secondarily, for those people who don't check the drag factor but do set the damper before tests, I'd be curious what you set their damper setting at and why.

**Edit**: So just to clarify. I'm wondering WHY people choose their drag factors. I am a bit of a numbers freak and I'm interested in the science behind the drag factor. For instance, what if I told you that you could cut your 2K erg time by 5% if you changed your drag factor? Well, I don't know if you can or can't but from searching around the Internet for more information I'm finding precious little about how to pick a drag factor that is optimal for a specific athlete and definitely nothing scientific to back anything up. From purely a physics standpoint it stands to reason that someone will get vastly different results when erging on 1 than on 10. I'm curious about how much effort goes into finding the drag factor that is most efficient for a particular person."	t5_2qljq	True

I'm just entering my junior year and some pretty shitty things are on the horizon for my school's men's rowing program. 

I posted a few months ago about getting my boatmates motivated for winter training, and I don't know if anything I or my coach did helped or backfired, but it's not good. Only I and one other guy have been training regularly, and only one other guy has trained at all besides us two. Not even enough to fill a competitive 4+.

But that's not the worst of it. Not only did three guys quit permanently at the end of last season, I found out today that the captain of my team (the third guy who trained) is quitting to take care of family stuff. He really does need to quit,  so I don't blame him, but it leaves us in a bad spot.

So now my crew consists of me, one other guy (who is *really* fast), a few guys who are a little slower than me, and one novice. It's the one novice that really worries me. Next year, my crew will be down to three and I'm not certain that anyone except me will stick around for it. 

My options, as I see it, are to either look around for a club to join in the area or recruit heavily and recruit now. Can any coaches or older rowers help me with some recruiting tactics? I am willing to do anything short of selling my body to a thai whorehouse to bring guys in. What should I do?

I stopped rowing about a year ago, and have had neither the money nor time (but mostly the money) to continue with what I consider the ultimate examination of physical and mental limits. The serene chill of early morning water, the focused breathing of the boat, every little buck and yaw--I loved the pain, I loved the speed and that moment when everything comes together in a surreal flow of unchecked force. Nothing really compares, to me.

I miss the hell out of rowing, and I have no idea when I will be able to do it again. I missed my chance at a scholarship in University because my roommates unknowingly dosed me with hash brownies right before nationals, nullifying the work I had done for two years to get there. It was pretty disastrous for me, and now I find myself constantly yearning to row again.

Has anything like this happened to you? Have you ever had to ""cope"" with not being able to row? Are there any rowing monasteries where I can disappear into the wild and everlasting waters to row for ever and ever?

A preliminary FAQ is up and running.  It covers many of the questions frequently asked by novices.  I have additional sections for Intermediate  and Collegiate rowers which will go live *tomorrow* after I catch up on my bar review course materials after court this afternoon.  In addition, there are sections on advanced training methodologies, such as peaking for multiple races, a more comprehensive section on diet, and a section on coaching that will go live *Tuesday* after my final court hearing.  These sections are geared mainly towards people training on their own or coaching smaller programs without any previous guidance -- I wouldn't tell another coach how to run his shop.  Sections on Coxing and Rigging will go up next *Wednesday* or *Thursday* after I move into my new apartment and get settled.

Thanks for your help.  If you have any suggestions, questions, or comments, please offer them in this thread -- I'd be happy to respond and hear feedback.

Seeing lightweight sophomores and juniors on this subreddit with 6:45 2k times kind of discourages me

One thing that surprised me is he was told he needs to be running 10k every day, I'm not sure for how long, he was told it was to build a baseline level of cv fitness.

Now this strikes me as rubbish, and a great way to injure yourself before the race even begins. I'm no expert on rowing though. If he had suggested rowing on a C2 for an hour a day I could understand this, but I can't see how long distance running would be beneficial.

Hello fellow Rowdittors,

I am an 18 yo rower from Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The club I row in has a particularity. It combines three water sports under the same roof: canoe-kayak, rowing and dragon boat. 

Our club is also really poor and has really shitty equipment. Our rowing division has a handful of singles and novice singles, 2 doubles and a quad. Both doubles and the quad date from the 70s. 

Our club currently pariticipates in a contest set up by Aviva Insurance, via their community fund. They give out $1M to projects all around Canada. Winning a 150 000 subsidy would mean, for the rowing division, 2 doubles, singles and a new quad. It would also mean a new dragon boat and a bunch of canoes and kayaks for the other divisions.

The contest is some kind of popularity contest, where the projects that have the most votes go into the higher tiers of competition. We are currently in the semi-finals.

To get to the finals, we need to finish in the first 10 projects of our budget category (large budget). That is why I need your votes! Help me out, r/rowing!
