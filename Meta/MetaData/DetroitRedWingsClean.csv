AD1066	145	10	24	"Here's an interesting research paper I came across on HFBoards today: [Estimating Player Contribution in Hockey with Regularized Logistic Regression](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=5967), and an article about the paper in question: [Individual Stars Don't Necessarily Win You a Stanley Cup, Says New Research From Chicago Booth](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/individual-stars-dont-necessarily-win-you-a-stanley-cup-says-new-research-from-chicago-booth-210979841.html?)

I figured anyone who's into advanced metrics might be interested. 

~

**Abstract:**

""We present a regularized logistic regression model for evaluating player contributions in hockey. The traditional metric for this purpose is the plus-minus statistic, which allocates a single unit of credit (for or against) to each player on the ice for a goal. However, plus-minus scores measure only the marginal effect of players, do not account for sample size, and provide a very noisy estimate of performance. We investigate a related regression problem: what does each player on the ice contribute, beyond aggregate team performance and other factors, to the odds that a given goal was scored by their team? Due to the large-p (number of players) and imbalanced design setting of hockey analysis, a major part of our contribution is a careful treatment of prior shrinkage in model estimation. We showcase two recently developed techniques -- for posterior maximization or simulation -- that make such analysis feasible. Each approach is accompanied with publicly available software and we include the simple commands used in our analysis. Our results show that most players do not stand out as measurably strong (positive or negative) contributors. This allows the stars to really shine, reveals diamonds in the rough overlooked by earlier analyses, and argues that some of the highest paid players in the league are not making contributions worth their expense.""
...

""**... An exception is Pavel Datsyuk, who stands out as the leagues very best, having a coefficient that is unmoved even after considering the strong team effect of his Red Wings.**""

An OT loss after a tight game would have been easier to swallow than the way the played last night. The Wings dominated, and they deserved it. Congrats.

That said: as you guys know the Ducks and Wings have developed a great playoff rivalry over the years and we'll miss you guys in the future (if only not not be able to get y'all back for this one ;) ).

Would you guys and gals be interested in doing the same thing here? I'm just tired of the old Brunner picture and would like to see something fresh here. It doesn't have to be recent, it can be whatever gets the most upvotes in the certain time frame before voting ends.

If it's not a popular idea, I can just change the pictures whenever I get around to it/find a cool picture.

Thoughts? **All comments get upvotes :D**

Thanks, Solace.

1369404650.0	1eyyu9	From Chicago	GlueGuns--Cool	81	12	17	"This might be a little premature, but I just wanted to express how much I'm going to miss this rivalry and extend congratulations to the Wings' success thus far. Sure, it has been painful to watch our Hawks, with such promise, melt down these past few games, particularly to such a bitter rival. It reminds me of the Bulls vs. Heat ECF a couple of years ago, when top-seeded Chicago lost 4 straight to the hated Heat after soundly winning game 1. Utter misery. Game 5 was the night of my bachelor party...it didn't go well (a Heat fan was a groomsman).

But its also these moments that give you some clarity on what it means to be a passionate fan. It reflects a willingness to emotionally bet big. The risk is high, but the rewards are sweet. I can honestly say that the 2010 cup win in game 6 was one of the best moments of my life. It was a warm Chicago night, and the entire city was watching the game. I was on the sidewalk patio of one of my favorite restaurants. When Kane hit that goal, the whole city erupted and poured into the streets. It was magical. It made the sleepless nights and stress all seem worth it. It made the depression of losing to you guys in 2009 seem worth it. I remember thinking, a few nights before the eventual win, thinking, ""I don't care if the Hawks never win another cup, I just want this one right now."" Ha. How quickly we forget.

Any passionate sports fan knows this misery and hopefully, too, the elation. And Detroit has some of the most passionate fans in the country. And, of course, knows that same defeat and occasional elation. I think the reason we take so much joy in our rivals' misery is because we know it ourselves and can empathize, and we're so fucking happy its not us.

I'm generally a pretty smart guy, but sports are something I can't reason with. Its impossible to explain to my wife how a bunch of guys I've never met playing a sport can make or break my day / week / month. In times of despair, I try and use the ""fuck it, its just sports"" logic on myself, which is entirely reasonable by the way, but it just doesn't work. Because I'm a fan. And maybe I should be proud of that. Yeah, the ups and downs are extreme, but doesn't that top just blandly trudging through life? Winning hard and losing hard make me feel alive.

The fact that a loss is prompting me to examine life in such a way and write all this should indicate how big of a baby I am about sports. But fuck it. You guys know what I mean. Because you're passionate fans as well.

Anyway, thanks to Detroit for making this rivalry something to care about, something that makes me feel alive. Even if its shitty sometimes. If you guys accomplish the likely and take the series, best of luck the rest of the way. I'll be cheering for you. Fuck, Howard is hot right now.

But no, fuck that, fuck you guys, go Hawks. Chicago in 7! :-)

Cheers, guys! And keep betting big.

Now, I'm not here to debate any of the issues we're pissed about. I'm not here to debate that the reffing has been terrible, that Smith has been bad, that we always collapse in the third period. Don't get me wrong - it frustrates the hell out of me to watch either the zebras or our boys giftwrap games. That penalty shot call? Probably one of the weakest calls I've seen in recent memory, besides maybe the non-goal on Shaw. Also of note: The Hawks hit a post at least twice a game in games 2 through 4. This has been a much tighter series than the scores have indicated. Bad refs, bad defense, bad third periods or no, this series has been supremely competitive.

What I am here to say is, we're all overreacting. I want to see us win the Cup and beat the fucking Blackhawks as much as the next guy, but... there's no reason to go after the team like that. I get the hate, I get the frustration... but seriously. We've done significantly better than last year. By no means am I packing it in, but we have no right to be pissed about this season. The boys have overperformed in light of how the offseason went.

Fuck, we lost Lidstrom and Stuart and replaced them with guys like Carlo Injury Colaiacovo and Kyle Pylon Quincey. Smith is playing next to the latter, and it's destroying his confidence. He's playing scared.

I'm not gonna say I'm not pissed at Smith for making a rookie mistake, because I am. But seriously, guys? Come on. He's a novice defenseman trying to fill the hole made by the retirement of one of the best defensemen of all time. Give the kid a fucking break. You don't have to go ahead and single him out as the other team's MVPs or bash him every single chance you get. He's not the only one who's costing us. Hell, Howard could have stopped both the Handzus and the penalty shot goals. Colaiacovo got called for slashing Frolik on the breakaway. The ref made a weak call. There isn't one single person to blame for anything. 

We weren't even supposed to make the playoffs this year until Jimmy got hot; this was supposed to be a rebuilding year. So what if we blew a 3-1 series lead? Look where we are, despite poor defensive play from guys like Smith and Kindl. Look where we were last year, despite two huge impact players in their stead in Lids and Stuart. We made it pretty deep in the playoffs in spite of our defense. We've stolen games in spite of our defense.

There's a fine line between being frustrated, and just being a sore loser. I get both. But come *on*, guys. Support the fucking boys, don't hang them out to dry. We're Red Wings fans. Stop with this bullshit. There's no reason to single people out. I get it, we've been the best team in the league over the last 20 years, but we lost both our chances to close out the series anyway. Whoop-de-doo. Our backs are against the wall again, and look at how we've performed under pressure this season.

We're supposed to be rebuilding this year, weren't supposed to make the playoffs, most of the sports media guys had Hawks six, and we took a 3-1 series lead. Whether or not we blew it is irrelevant, we dominated the best team (on the scoresheet, at least) in the league for a good portion of this series. Fuck 'em. 

We've still got game 7. Don't lose faith just yet.

So, don't pack it in yet. Let's put the nooses, torches, and pitchforks away and see what happens.

**TL;DR:** Calm the fuck down and LGRW. There's still one game left. And what the fuck ever happens, we've made a much deeper run than last year. We have a future. There's nothing to worry about."	t5_2resw	True

They took a team devastated by injuries and the loss of the best defenseman ever to lace up skates to the playoffs, using a bunch of kids who started the season in the AHL. 

They continued the longest post-season attainment streak in professional sports.

Then they eliminated the #2 team in the conference.

Then they took the #1 team in the conference, and the league, President's Trophy winners, to overtime of game 7. 

None of that was ""supposed to happen."" They were supposed to be ""rebuilding."" They weren't supposed to make the playoffs. Then they were supposed to go out to the Ducks. Then the Hawks were going to sweep them. 

All that ""conventional wisdom"" was WRONG. This is a team of proud warriors, led by the best coach in hockey. There was no way they'd miss the playoffs. There was no way they'd go out early or easy. 

I'm proud of the team and proud of we fans who love them. I've been watching the Red Wings for a lot of years, and I can't remember being more excited about an upcoming season. I'm looking forward to them coming back healthy and rested and better than ever, and kicking ass all across the East on the way to their 12th Stanley Cup.

1368988394.0	1en5z0	This series' trend baffles me.	EarthenChild	61	10	38	"I understand that Chicago has a very talented team, but why exactly do I continuously hear Red Wing fans say ""Detroit just isn't as talented as the Hawks"" and ""We're just not as fast as Chicago"" and ""Chicago's depth far outmatches Detroit's"" and the like?

I've been a die-hard fan for twenty-two years, and although it's clear that this isn't the best incarnation of the Red Wings, it's obvious to me that we play just as (if not more) intelligently than the Hawks. 

If such sentiments are based entirely off of the numbers, than I guess we aren't as talented. But as a hockey player, I know that even the best teams have losing seasons...

So let's start showing support rather than displaying futility. I know the Wings can compete with Chicago. "	t5_2resw	True
1368025893.0	1dxog0	My 'Jimmy Howard was snubbed' rant	Gordie_Howe	68	9	40	"Today, Henrik Lundqvist, Sergei Bobrovksy, and Antti Niemi were confirmed as Vezina Finalists. I am obviously extremely biased, but I believe that Jimmy should have been ~~nominated~~ selected as a finalist. I understand that numbers aren't everything, but I feel that they should be provided when discussing trophy finalists. 


* Lundqvist: 43 GS, 24 W, 16 L, 3 OTL, 88 GA, 2.05 GAA, .926 SV%, 2 SO

* Bobrovsky: 37 GS, 21 W, 11 L, 6 OTL, 74 GA, 2.00 GAA, .932 SV%, 4 SO

* Niemi:  43 GS, 24 W, 12 L, 6 OTL, 93 GA, 2.16 GAA, .924 SV%, 4 SO

* Howard: 42 GS, 21 W, 13 L, 7 OTL, 87 GA, 2.13 GAA, .923 SV%, 5 SO

I think at this point, you all probably realize that I think Howard should have gotten the nod over Niemi, but let's look at some more numbers. 


Team win % when being out shot: 

* NY Rangers: .524

* Columbus Blue Jackets: .484

* San Jose Sharks: .438

* Detroit Red Wings: .667


Man games lost to injury:

* NYR: 226

* CBJ: 250

* SJS: 249 

* DET: 395


Combined +/- for top 4 TOI earning defensemen:

* NYR: +22

* CBJ: +5

* SJS: +11

* DET: +13


Rookie defensemen with at least 10 games:

* NYR: 0

* CBJ: 3

* SJS: 2

* DET: 3


Goals for per game:

* NYR: 2.62

* CBJ: 2.40

* SJS: 2.42

* DET: 2.54


Win % when leading after the second period:

* NYR: 1.000

* CBJ: 1.000

* SJS: .833

* DET: .857


Alright, I think that is enough to get my point across, which is that Howard was either in a similar or worse position when compared to the 3 finalists. As Wings fans, we all know the obstacles Detroit faced this year: losing the Perfect Human, injuries all over the roster, frustrating scoring droughts, and under performing key players (Filppula, Cleary, White, etc.) among others. The one aspect of this team that I could almost always rely on was Jimmah Howard standing tall in the Wings' cage. 


I think the Red Wings' reputation as an established power in the league hurt Howard's chances. I have nothing against any of the finalists, but in terms of importance to his team, Howie was undoubtedly #2 behind Bobrovsky. I'd like to see Bob win it, I just wish Howard got the recognition he deserved this year. 


**In the end, individual trophies don't mean anything, and I'm way more concerned with the Wings making a run for the Cup. Let's go Red Wings!**

DKF22	54	8	57	"As this offseason drives me one step closer to insanity each day, I've been thinking maybe r/DRW should have a meetup or something in Detroit for a game? I don't know exactly how this all works or how to set it up or anything, but  figured if there was interest, things would take form one way or another.

I figure maybe we should do it on a Saturday or Sunday and meetup before the game somewhere that will be showing the game and close to the Joe for some pregame fun. That way, if people want to go to the game, they can. If they just want to hang out and watch the game and save a few bucks, they can do that to. Any interest or ideas about this?

2. The clear majority of our penalties were lazy penalties, work on that.

3. Shut up about Ericcson, him and Kronwall did a great job last night. They are a top D line, and proved it. They worked harder than they should have, but did so willingly. White was solid as usual as well. I completely agree with the Quincey bashing, trade him if possible... I could have swore he (and others) showed up for

4. Gustavsson was great when he came in like that, I can't wait to see more of him (I'm sure he'll challenge Howard for start). GO MONSTER! Howard was left out to dry too much, he should bounce back.

5. Penalties were lazy and it seemed like the lines that worked showed up for the game were the first and fourth lines.

6. MOST IMPORTANTLY: THIS IS GAME 1, CALM THE FUCK DOWN.

Now onto players (trading and such), we probably will see a few more games before Kenny even thinks of trading. Again, this was game 1. We'll see Babcock work everyone into lines, if the D and p.k. still doesn't work, we'll trade. The lockout has left quite a few players rusty, with no preseason games it might be a slow start. I'm sure Monday we'll look a lot better. I'm still excited what this team can do.

I was ripping mad last night. So much so that my phone is still missing...

One big reason (among a pile of frustrations and non-playoff related stresses) was one ~~man~~ goon: Shea Weber. At first when I logged onto reddit and saw the mutual distaste, the ""Kronwalled or Alive"" poster... I felt vindicated that my rage was not isolated.

Yet the hostility is bothering me, and here is why: Hockeytown is synonymous class. We aren't some expansion team, nor are we moronic bandwagoners... One of the reasons I started cheering for Detroit as a child was how well guys like Yzerman, Coffee, Shanahan played with class and lived that way too. Even Probert was a different kind of goon; one who could scrap, score and skate.

Let's keep our heads high. Last night Nashville won on fluke goals and stupid penalties; we are better than that. Let's not resort to their level; instead of tactless ""Fuck Shea Weber"" posts, let's keep it classy and hand them their predatory gonads on a silver freaking platter."	t5_2resw	True

But there is one thing upon which *we all* agree.

Pavel Datsyuk is a fucking magician and we are all lucky to have watched him the past decade. He's my favorite player and has been for years. And so, I present to you good Wings fans a small gift.

[I believe in Pavel Datsyuk](http://i.imgur.com/kGiA9.jpg). Fans of The Dark Knight will recognize the style. It's the ""I believe in Harvey Dent"" posters that were everywhere. I also made one using the [""Believe""](http://i.imgur.com/ZEkSR.png) patches that were made after Vladdy's accident. 

I have a friend who rocks too hard and she made me a few patches. I got em everywhere. My jacket has a patch sewn on the arm. Got one on my shoulder bag. [My backpack](http://i.imgur.com/YhUfYEl.jpg) has a button version that I made through an internet button maker. Just upload your image and they put it on a button. Easy.

I uploaded the [.psd](http://www.mediafire.com/?9qv13iejpfiss7d) here for anyone that might want to play with it or make their own patches/buttons.

Isn't it funny (or painful, depending on perspective) that Columbus refused to trade him to us, despite our offer being the best one, just because we are in their division? We aren't in their division anymore and the team he was traded to, the Rangers, is!

Do you guys think we would be better off with him, or if we are better off now with the moves we made in free agency?

1366886792.0	1d2q45	Something Kronwall said at the end of this article has got me thinking.	mtsax305	42	2	47	"""“This has become our home,” Kronwall said, leaning against a wall in the dressing room, a posh oasis in a spartan, outdated arena. “I know they’ve been talking about building a new rink. I hope they don’t, as long as I’m here at least.
“I don’t think there’s any way to just bring the culture and the history from this building and just move the banners and start something there. I don’t think it works like that. There’s something special about this rink, all the special players that have been here and are still around.”""

My feelings are that JLA may be a spartan, outdated arena, but it's our spartan, outdated arena. Do you guys agree with Kronwall that something big will change when the Wings get a new arena? Even if the Wings deserve a new arena, is it the ""charm"" of our ""dump"" that gives a certain home ice advantage to the Wings?
