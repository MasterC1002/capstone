I have written two conference papers and a project report using it, so I am pretty familiar with it, but of course there is always more to learn.

I am mainly looking for tips and advice on how to structure a large document.  I am familiar with the \input command, and would like to use it to write each chapter separately.  I saw a nifty idea online somewhere, where someone used an if statement that would allow the individual files to be compiled with their preambles, but would leave the preambles out when compiling the whole document.

I'm basically looking for things like that, that will make writing such a large document much easier and efficient.  I don't want to get halfway through writing my thesis and realize there was a way to do something that would have saved me tons of time if I had been doing it from the start.

Any help would be appreciated!"	t5_2qhbn	True

I'm planning on using [this PhD thesis template](http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/ThesisStyle/) from the University of Cambridge, [the LaTeX Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) as a general reference and [this tool](http://truben.no/latex/table/) to make tables.

Is there anything else I should be aware of that would make my life easier?




Regarding the editor, I'm torn between the [GeanyLaTeX plugin](http://frank.uvena.de/en/Geany/geanylatex/) and [Gummi](http://dev.midnightcoding.org/projects/gummi).

Has anyone worked with any of these with a big project such as a thesis and can advise for or against it?
Any reason why I should go for one of the big editors (i.e.: Texmaker) instead?


Thank you /r/LaTeX!

1367431232.0	1dhtn8	Thinking about starting a resource for LaTeX for non-STEM types. I've got questions and need suggestions.	bfootdav	31	4	28	"I am a writer and composer and use LaTeX (actually LuaTeX) and Lilypond for all my stuff (plus a little Inkscape as needed).  I am able to produce amazingly beautiful output (typography-wise, no claims about the content) with these tools.  It seems to me that there are a lot of people who could likewise benefit from TeX and thus not have to pay so much money for alternatives like InDesign.

What I would like to do is set up a resource for them.  Something that doesn't even mention typesetting equations (OK, they might need to typeset some math but you get the point).  While I am thinking more in terms of creative types I could also see this being useful for academic types outside the realm of math and science so the resource would still need things about bibliographies and such.

So here are my questions:

1) **Is this even needed?** Does this resource already exist?  There probably is not much of an audience, yet, but I would like to think it's something that could grow. I know there's a learning curve with TeX but my thought on this is that every piece of software out there that produces professional quality output has a significant learning curve.  InDesign ain't no walk in the park.  The nature of the learning might be different but I am convinced that anyone dedicated to making their own professional quality works can learn LaTeX.  

2) **Does it have to be Mac-centric?** I suspect the answer to that is yes.  I only use Linux and Emacs.  This puts me at a significant disadvantage for helping what I assume would be the core of this particular audience.  Obviously I would need help in figuring out what software would be best for each platform.

3) **Text editor vs. fancy editor?** As mentioned above I use Emacs.  I cannot imagine ever using anything else.  Further it feels to me that learning how to do all this stuff manually makes you better at using it but I understand there are trade-offs and it might not be worth it.  Thoughts?

4) **Best engine to use?**. I assume that most of these folk will have many commercial typefaces on their computers and will want to use them and do so easily.  So for this I'd imagine the best engine would be XeTeX or LuaTeX, and for reasons mentioned below, I'm going with the latter.

5) **Specific packages**.  Definitely need help here.  At the top of my list is microtype which not only produces pretty spectacular output but also cuts way down on the need for hyphens.  Not that hyphens are bad, but limiting them is better.  Also selnolig which is still in beta and hasn't been uploaded to CTAN yet.  It has built-in tables to ""undo"" some automatic ligatures that can create readability problems (like ""shelfful"" where you might not want the two ""f""s to be combined across syllable/morphemes like that).  Are there any other of these specific and somewhat obscure packages that folks like this really need even if they don't know they need them yet?

6) **Document classes**.  Right now I just use the book class from LaTeX and then customize headers with fncychap and titlesec.  I think I might be missing out by not using the memoir class, is this true?  Also, what is KOMA and is it relevant to this discussion?

6.5) Take points 5 &amp; 6 together the idea is to create template files and the like to make these processes as easy as possible.  For example, I have one preamble.tex file that I use in all my projects.  I can alter it if needed but generally I don't have to and I do not have to remember that one little package that I need just in case I need to do this one thing.

7) **Poetry** I have a little bit of poetry that I generally just format by hand.  I am aware that options exist out there but am not familiar enough with them. Suggestions?

8) **Music** As I mentioned, I use Lilypond.  I then take the pdfs produced by Lilypond and incorporate them into my LuaTeX file.  Would we really need to help out composers like this?  I mean is that particular audience ever going to get big enough?  Or what about help with MusiXTeX?  I want to include all creative-art types but there might need to be limits.

9) **Any other art mediums I've missed?**

10) **Other external software?** I do use Inkscape for some graphic stuff which then gets imported into my LaTeX files.  What other programs are useful in this regard (with priority given to other free programs since that's kind of the point of all this)?

11) **Online LaTeX stuff**.  I'm aware that there are several online LaTeX generators out there.  I have not really looked at any of them.  Would they be of benefit for this project?

12) **Any other suggestions?**

As a point of reference, I recently typeset a paper for an online journal of pop-culture studies.  They ended up not using my typeset version (someone else wrote it -- I just typeset it) because of timing issues but oh my freakin' god, my version was so much better than the very ugly crap they do.  Seriously, they had margins out to the edge of the page, no justification, not even smoothing out of the right margin, no ligatures, no hyperlinks, etc.  The difference is night and day.  It seems there is a real opportunity here for all sorts of people outside of science and math to benefit from TeX but they just need some nudging.
