1367917845.0	1dupf2	Am I the only one who thinks the writers have done a reasonably good job with the Caskett relationship?	Multidisciplinary	94	10	51	"I read some of the opinions floating around in this subreddit about the bad writing and I wonder if I'm watching the same show...

* The first few episodes deal with the two of them coming to terms with their relationship starting, with their friends and family finding out. The Hamptons episode is a great early-relationship snapshot of a weekend getaway where they find out little tidbits about each other (Yes Kate, your boyfriend is really rich. Yes Rick, your girlfriend can cook.)...

* The next mini-arc deals with them getting established a bit more. There's the official-meet-the-parents dinner, both of them adjusting their holidays routine to try and be with each other, Beckett getting an insight into Castle's ex/Alexis' mom, her staying over at his place for a few days (a significant step), culminating in the Valentine's Day moment where she accepts him permamently into her home. 

* Target/Hunt then step it up another level, as she tries to support him through his biggest challenge over the course of the show. She openly shows affection in the office, not caring whether Gates sees, placing his needs above hers. Symbolically, she's waiting at home with Martha when they come back, as one big family unit when they re-unite. And she scolds him not for going to Paris but doing it without her. The contrast of signifance here is with 'Cops and Robbers' in season 4 where she was on the outside watching in as the Castle family reunited. This time she's on the inside with them. 

* After this, she's basically shown to be living with Castle. All the domestic scenes are at his place, she has clothes there, she comes over after work even if he was at home writing...she spends at least most of the week there. Unofficially living together by this stage. She also stages his best b'day present ever, showing that she knows him so well, so much better than anyone else ever has. 

* Culminating in the Big Moment of Still where she admits she loves him, and they don't really have to hide their relationship in the office any more.

* OK, the 800-pound-gorilla in the room is S&amp;Q. And you know what, I kinda understand where Beckett's coming from. For all their progress, they haven't actually sat down and defined the relationship and talked about where they're going. For two people of their ages, with significant baggage (children, ex-wives, committment issues etc) that's both understandable AND something they have to deal with as adults. The jarring part of the episode is NOT that Beckett wants to discuss a sense of their future together, but the mild flirting with Vaughn. 

* Beckett not talking to Castle about the job offer...yeah that's dumb, but that's Beckett. She still has these hang-ups, and she's terrible about articulating her feelings. We saw a similar situation in the Christmas episode, for example, where she felt she had to lie to Castle. But she struggled through it, and they came out for the stronger. I hope the same happens in the finale. I honestly DON'T WANT her to choose between Castle and her career. I hope they can write a scenario where they stay together and Beckett advances somehow.

I kept thinking to myself that there have been loads of near death experiences and she never gave into her feelings before.

But I've recently been doing a bit of a Castle marathon and I realized something: **Always was the first near death experience when Castle and Beckett weren't together**.

As far as I can think they've always been together when one of them was at risk of dying. Apartment shootout in season one; apartment bombing in season two; freezing to death in season 3; dirty bomb in season three; tiger in season 4; near execution by agents in season 4.

So what struck Kate during her apartment dangling in the finale was that Castle is always there with her. Except this time.

On Mondays, he watches Hawaii Five-O and I watch Castle. But since the season ended he hasn't had anything else to watch. So he started with the old Castle eps.

And he loved them!

This happened a while back.

But that's not all. He gets into Season 3 and the drama of that and he's all excited and then... ""Knockout"". Season 3, Episode 24, the season finale... remember?

**SPOILERS**

He charges into my room and says ""Kate's dead!""

Me: ""What?"" (I have a cousin named Katie...)

Dad: ""Kate's dead!"" he repeats.

Me: ""Oh my god! How?""

Dad: ""She was shot! In a cemetery! Rick was saying he loved her and then it cut out!""

Me: ""Rick? Who's Rick?""

Dad storms off, upset. I have my cell in my hands, trying to remember who to call when it clicked. 

Me: ""Castle? You're talking about Castle?""

Dad: ""What else? Why would you make me watch this show?""

I burst out laughing and crying and since I don't have Season 4 on DVD yet, well, I bring out the laptop. 

He watches Season 4 Episode 1 in complete silence.

Then, it's roughly 2 am, and we finish watching it together. He stands, nods at me, and goes to bed. 

This is a man who doesn't get emotional about most things that would leave the rest of us weeping.

I awoke this morning with a fun meme idea for the members of this subreddit. In my morning stupor, I quickly made and posted meme without a spoilers tag for Episode 504 ""Murder, He Wrote."" I realized my fault later in the morning, but I was without a computer to resolve the issue. By the time I could access reddit, the damage was done. I ruined the episode(s) for other viewers. I understand any frustration I have caused for those who haven’t caught up yet. Although I cannot fix the problem for those who have already seen the meme, I removed the improperly titled post from the subreddit in order to avoid ruining the episode for others. Please accept my apologies.

Sincerely,

TheGuacSnob

Castle is fucking LOADED. Sure, he likes New York, but he Loves Beckett. And FFS, it's only DC. It's like, maybe 4 hours from NYC to DC by car, shorter by plane, and I wouldn't put it past Castle to learn how to fly a Helicopter. Or he could just buy a house there and move and also keep the house in NYC. It's not like it's fucking China or anything. 

If I were Castle, I would be absolutely THRILLED that Beckett has this opportunity, and their both being incredibly stupid about it. 

I'm more concerned about what will happen to Ryan and Esposito. I really want Beckett to tell the AG that she needs her team with her, but I doubt she's taking the job, because it would mean writing too many great cast members out. Besides, they're going to risk jumping the shark, transferring the Show to DC, losing a lot of the cast, etc. etc.

The missus and I started watching Castle 2 months or so back and we are on Season 3 right now. The episode we watched tonight was especially great because the missus is an X-Files fan and I am a Firefly fan. 

1) The moment of the security guards hand lamp shining just like they all do in the X-Files. We pointed that out before we knew the episode was going to be sci-fi inspired. The lamp light must just be that iconic.

2) Where Castle whistles the theme tune to the X-Files we both tried whistling it until smiling prevented anything more than just a single note sounding.

3) Bishop was in this one :) It's definitely a great sci-fi episode when you've got a guy from The Terminator and Aliens.

4) Castle talks like William Shatner in the car right before they get abducted. Maybe. It. Was. A. Bit. Too. Subtle. But. We. Thought. it was. Funny. 

5) Castle speaks Chinese, it's a silly line in Chinese and he explains it away with ""from a show I used to love"" :D 

6) At the end when they both walk away in the darkness and Becketts hair looks a bit redder in the light (Scully reference?) the episode ends with this frame that took several attempts capturing. http://i.imgur.com/eNwn2kX.jpg

It was fun to watch, more than usual. Castle is such a good show and we enjoy it lot's, she misses X-Files and I want more Firefly. Anything else we missed from this one? "	t5_2scog	True

I understand he can be a bit goofy at times, but every single woman, save for possibly Lanie, has complete control of all his actions.  Beckett constantly give him grief about everything, even when defending the same action warranting the grief to other people.  His daughter treats him like a breathing wallet, bombarding him with guilt over any shred of fathering he tries to do that she doesn't agree with (only the last 2 season or so).  Being his mother, she is the most understandable in doing this but sadly does it less than the two above.[spoiler](#s ""Even his ex wife walks in and just takes over his home and life in the most recent episode."")

I don't think he should have his way all the time or change how he acts or be more ""manly"" i just don't understand how anyone, man or woman, would lie down to all these people at every turn.  The only time he really stood up to any of them was when [spoiler](#s ""He told Beckett to stop looking into her mother's case cause it literally meant her life"").

I was worried for a bit there that Slaughter was the one who, well, killed the guy. Good to see he's not such a bad guy after all... Though, I really hope Castle doesn't actually testify at his hearing. Dude needs to rein it in.

The second time was when they were in the precinct talking about the case and again Castle says something and walks out of the room and gives a high-five to a cop, female i believe.

In a world of samey nonsensical jibber jabber cop procedurals, Castle offered a refreshing take to the genre. Focusing on quirky stories and personal relationships it was genuinely entertaining, and hard to just call it a 'cop show'. Now I know there have always been serious undertones in the show (Beckett's mother's death was talked of since season 1) but lately the show has felt the same as any other procedural. 

Some of it has worked ok, personally I think the whole thing Montgomery having been dirty was heavy handed and kinda stupid, but it was ok. Hell, even the triple killer wasn't too bad. But a freaking nuke in the city?

And now this shit? A linchpin that could destroy the country? Aside from the fact that that's an incredibly absurd idea, the second half of this two-parter was some of the worst written TV I could ever hope to watch.  The bad guy is actually the good guy, the good guy is actually bad guy!? Genius! The episode felt like a bunch of overused tropes and was thoroughly unsatisfying.

I loved this show in the beginning, and I'll probably still watch it if only for the fact that I love the cast, but I have to say, I'm incredibly disappointed with where this show is going, the writers really need to get their shit together,

Ok.

What a great season. God damn this show is amazing. So this season was very cool and it had some great funny moments, touching moments, real moments, and down right silly moments. It was overall a great load of fun to watch.

Now, the ending was so great we both punched the air and giggled like kids, it was so exciting and totally worth the wait. The boys having a falling out..damn I hope that resolves itself (yes we know it will but..dude...ok?...). 

Castles speech to Beckett where he is just honest with her was about damn time. I'm going to re-watch it tomorrow specifically to watch that part because Fillion was amazing. Beckett finally being honest and unafraid, ""I want you"" *smoooch**implied going to bed*...it was so awesome and happy, a happy ending for them both. It's about time.

We start season 5 tomorrow night, we've got some predictions already but I hope none of them come true.

1337833729.0	u29ka	Predictions for whats ahead	wild9	21	7	22	"Ok, so I've just caught up with the Castle train, I saw the last five or so episodes as they came out and then immediately went out and got all the DVDs. I've been power watching for about two weeks now, and now that I'm doomed to wait out the summer with the rest of you, I wanna discuss what's up next! I’d be willing to bet money on some of these, others are just simply wild conjecture:

* First off! Beckett will be back on the force no later than the mid-season break. Being a detective is as much a part of Beckett's identity as Batman is to Bruce Wayne's (I know, I know, a lot of people, including myself, would argue that Bruce is more a part of Batman's identity than the other way around, but I'm keeping the simile as simple as possible). Now, resigning from the force was an important step for Beckett as a character, it showed she had finally let go and was willing to be happy. But being a detective hasn't been solely due to her mother's murder for a while now, she is the one to ""give a voice to the victims"". There's a reason she said that she resigned as opposed to just saying she quit. And from a purely technical point, the show kind of needs her to be a detective. Beckett being reinstated would have to be after the amount of time that Gate's suspension would've been up, so I think the earliest that she will be back on the force is about four to six episodes in, but it won't happen any later than the 13th or 14th episodes.
* Now the question is, *why* would Beckett rejoin the force? Beckett is too stubborn to rejoin just because she wants to go back, she'll have to be forced to need to have the badge back and the resources that come with it, which brings me to my next point...
* Castle is about to become obsessed with Beckett's case. He's spent four seasons passively working on it, trying to help Beckett, but now that she's finally torn down the wall between them there's no way in hell that he'd let anything happen to her. He's been sitting on the Smith lead for a year now, and once it becomes clear that Beckett isn't free from her detractors, he's going to jump in headfirst to put an end to it. Beckett’s shooter is going to take advantage of this and go after Castle, going off the fact that Smith’s files would have a big ass picture of Castle and he’d probably find out he’s who Smith’s contact has been. This is big, Castle has never been targeted in the series. Sure, he’s been in dangerous spots plenty of times before, but no bad guy has set off with the express intent of doing Castle in. Castle will be captured to draw Beckett out into the open and she’ll return to the force to save him.
* Beckett is about to have a kick ass season. Let’s face it, our favorite detective’s previous year has sucked pretty hard. It started with a bullet to the chest and ended with her attacker throwing her off a roof and mocking her before walking away, with a fair sprinkling of near drownings, tiger maulings, and ptsd to make it even worse. Beckett’s been through shit, and she’s just now at the most vulnerable point she’s ever been throughout the series, both emotionally and physically. She tore down emotional barriers that she had protected herself with and the one thing keeping her would-be killers at bay has now been torn down as well. She’s going to be tested throughout the season, but the show can either reward her by the end of it or punish her for letting her guard down, and so help me, if it’s the latter I’m putting my shoe through my TV. 
* Beckett will start paying back Castle for all that he’s done for her. A) If you go off of major story arcs (the one’s that last more than one episode), Castle has saved Beckett much more than she’s saved him, and B) Castle has helped Beckett on a much deeper level by helping her put her mother’s murderer to rest. To borrow from the Avengers, there’s red in Beckett’s ledger, and she’s about to start paying it off. Not that the characters take the inequity between the two any seriously, but it’s important that Beckett get back to an equal footing. This will play out over the course of the rest of the series.
* Here’s where I get less sure: Beckett’s shooter will be the main antagonist for the first part of the season, but I don’t know how long that’ll last. It’s clear that there isn’t really anything keeping him back from going after Beckett, but the second he does it starts a timer that can only go on for so long. It’ll culminate with him taking Castle hostage and Beckett putting him down for good, but if it starts on the first episode of the season, I don’t know how it won’t be resolved by the third episode at the latest, and I don’t know how they could take a break for a few episodes in between then. This throws off my whole timeline, it’s kind of frustrating, and I’d love to hear your theories.
* The story arc of Beckett’s mother’s murder will be ended by the season’s end, and Castle’s major story arc will pick up there. Castle’s arc will obviously be over his father (uh, duh doy). There wasn’t anything else that Kate could possibly help him through to pay him back for what he’s done for her, and it was confirmed for me when the CIA girl said something about it before getting shot (I was pretty proud of myself for calling this at the start of season three). This arc will play out till the end of the series, so about two, *maybe* three seasons. I’m not sure yet whether Castle’s father will be good or bad. I’m leaning towards him being a bad guy, it would give plenty of material to send Castle into a tailspin as he uncovers all the bad that his father has done, and give him the chance to grow as the show comes to an end. But I could see him being a good-guy and in need of saving as well.

Now, my next point is just pure conjecture, but  read on and try to tell me it wouldn’t be the sickest two hours of television ever:

* The big story arc in the middle of the season will feature a mad scientist about to release a biological weapon on the city. I want to say it’ll be a toxin that he puts in the water system. We’ve had the FBI, the DHS, and CIA make appearances in these midseason arcs, so I’ll put money on the NSA coming into play on this one. Now, none of what I’ve said has been too particularly amazing, but what pushes this arc from merely awesome to legen... wait for it... dary, is Dr. Horrible himself makes the cameo as the evil scientist. Yes, Nathan Fillion and NPH go head-to-head once again, with the fate of the city at stake. Neil Patrick Harris throws his dramatic weight around and we get an amazing mid-season story. Bam.

Now, what do you think will happen?

My thoughts about upcoming episodes are about is 3XK really dead(probably not)? and will he come back this season for Castle, Beckett, or one of his family members?
Also as i remember Castle doesnt know who his dad is and if im right according to the show his mom doesnt either. But his dad was brought up three that i can think of. 1. When his daughter asked him about it and he said he didnt know. 2. When the Spy dressed as CIA mentioned his dad just before she got shot. and 3. His ex quickly mentioned it when talking to Beckett. So my im wondering will Beckett ask or dig into who his dad is or talk about it.
Just a side note: It took them 4 seasons for them to get Castle and Beckett together, they better not break them up or anything. If they do, its basically a typical TV show write up. They need to make them stay together, it gets kinda old when tv shows break couples up when they dont need to."")"	t5_2scog	True

And yes they're and older couple so things might go faster than younger couples but for all the thing Kate's been going thru with her mom and her issues and then im sure Castle has issues with being married 3 times.

It would just feel like really bad writing/TV if would have spent 4 years working on getting Kate and Castle together just to have them be a couple for only 1 season. Plus I feel like a break-up would be to predictable or its been seen to many times.  I also feel like something big will happen besides Kates FBI offer, like maybe a proposal or moving in together/getting their own place.  I dont see the show where Kate, Castle, Ryan, Espo, and Lanie aren't part of the show or a team.

Castle (and maybe Ryan) could believe Shawn is psychic and everything whereas as usual, Becket is skeptical. It would one of the more lighthearted episodes and I'd love to see the look on Becket's face when Shawn figured something out that would appear he could only know if he he really were psychic.

1371337931.0	1gfakr	[Spoilers up to S4E20] My Perspective on Castle with Incomplete Knowledge	smeltofelderberries	7	2	12	"So, I just started watching Castle. As in, maybe a week ago. I caught an episode about the Beckett conspiracy from Season 3 (when Lockewood escapes), which started me on S1E1.

I love Nathan Filion as Castle. His gradual transformation from playboy to a more mature but still playful person has been gratifying. Beckett is a great character and Katic's portrayal of PTSD after Beckett got shot was very good.

The overarching plots, in my opinion, make this show. The overarching love plot, which right now is in lurch because Castle saw Beckett saw that she remembered her getting shot. I can't stop watching now because it is SO GODDAMN INFURIATING that they keep playing phone tag about their relationship.

The chemistry of the team is also a selling point for this show. The characters are more distinct than I'm used to with police shows. I'm glad that characters like Ryan have their own little arcs, complete with twists (like Jenny being in the book from the pickup artists). 

The Beckett conspiracy is also intriguing and NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT MORE (no spoilers please). The mysterious figure in the garage, Beckett getting shot, and the stuff referenced by the mayor about his scandal have sucked me in.

Overall, this is one of the best police shows I've ever watched, thanks to the team's chemistry and the overarching plotlines that keep getting nibbled at bit by tedious bit. I'm just sad I wasn't caught up to watch five.

EDIT: FUCK THIS LIMEY FOR STEALING BECKETT. SHE DESERVES CASTLE. AND HE JUST NEEDS TO TALK TO HER.

EDIT TWO: HOLY SHIT CASTLE IN A BAR FIGHT. SLAUGHTER IS AMAZING.

EDIT THREE: SLAUGHTER IS NOT A GOOD DUDE. BAD SLAUGHTER. BAD. I DON'T WANT BECKETT TO GET FIRED. OH JESUS HOLD ME.

EDIT FOUR: LOL at actual letters from colleges. I got that shit online.

EDIT FIVE: Hot damn Alexis is getting grown up. She's always been the adult, but she shut down that laser tag pretty quickly.

TL;DR - I love this show and wanted to share my feelings not having seen the entire show."	t5_2scog	True

There are two reviewers, one who is just a fan of the show and another who is a fan of the show but is also an ex-cop and so provides insight onto the actual police elements of the show. I think they always give good reviews, even if I don't always agree with them. I especially find the cop procedure parts interesting, even when they don't relate to Castle.

&gt;I'm a huge fan of this show, for more than just the Beckett/Castle relationship. In fact, during the entire first season and parts of the second, I never really thought much about the two of them falling in love. The writers started moving that direction and as it went, I went with them on it. This entire season has been nothing but a mess of ridiculously perfect moments that should have resulted in something!
This episode was the worst yet! I'm all for drawing it out. Stringing it to where that final moment when the spark ignites... the audience is screaming with them! But COME ON! You set this entire scenario up... Josh is leaving, FINALLY when in fact, I never saw him as anything but a name and a face you threw in as a road block, they almost die... literally DIE together TWICE in one episode and NOTHING? He loves her... she almost said she loves him... and then you end it like that?
It's completely unbelievable. People don't act that way? Hell, you're bound to tell someone you love them when you are seconds away from sure death. WHY? Why did neither of them say anything when they were freezing? Why when the bomb was definitely going to blow them up? That whole thing that the writers created between those two should have had a moment here... and it's absence just ruined a fabulous episode!
If something doesn't happen now, after everything in this episode, then the writers need to stop with the emotional and sexual tension between the two of them. Leave them as friends and move on already. Otherwise, it's just plain unbelievable and will destroy the rest that the show has going for it.

1) Castle and Becket should have gotten together a long time ago. Surely no one in real life flirts like that for 4 years? They dragged it out for too long and by the time they did get together I didn't really care.

2) They should have wrapped up the whole Becket's mum murder plot a long time ago. Like the relationship they've dragged it out and it's become stupid. Does anyone still watching actually care who's behind this plot now, whoever it is will be a stupid reveal.

They should have had at least one of these sewn up by the end of the second season, the fact they've only just answered one and the other one is still as open as ever is a bit ridiculous really. 

3) Did Lainie actually study to become a doctor or did she just watch a few episodes of CSI:Miami? Some of her diagnoses are impossibly accurate.

4) Alexis is somehow the most mature 18 year old I've ever seen yet also the most whingey. She somehow spots flaws in ME reports despite never going to medical school yet spends episodes crying because she's growing up and is going to college. 

5) The format has become stale. A basic episode goes like this. 1) Scene of Castle at home with family, usually some sort of problem at home. 2) Becket and Castle talking about this problem as they walk up to a murder scene. 3) Lainie gives some ridiculous speech about how she can tell exactly what type of gun killed the victim despite the victim still being fully clothed and not properly examined yet 4) A few suspects are identified, usually one has had an argument with the victim the week before. 5) Beckett interviews each of the suspect in turn for about a minute until it becomes apparent none of them did it. 6) Usually one of these interviewees gives a clue which leads them to arrest the most obvious suspect (there are about 10 minutes to go at this point) 7) They interview him/her and realise it's not them but someone they had previously talked to but not interviewed as a suspect (about 5 minutes to go). They arrest said suspect and get a confession with 2 or 3 minutes of the episode left. 8) Kate and Castle have a moment. 9) Castle solves his problem at home

6) I don't really like Captain Gates

Then again, people don't usually watch Castle and other such shows (especially Castle) for the mystery alone.

Crime of the week was kinda meh, though it provided a nice opportunity to show the comic book geek side of Beckett (we all knew Castle was one, really). The old season-long story wasn't really advanced in this episode – at all – but then Castle tends to be more crime-of-the-week and character-based for most of the series, leaving the ""main plot"" to show up again in the season finale (or, occasionally, a random midseason episode).

1370601348.0	1furlb	How I think season 6 should start out	the_derp_kid	4	4	4	"We end season 5 with Castle proposing to Beckett at the playground swings. We cut to Beckett's office in DC with her playing with her hands, noticeably missing a ring. She is called to her superiors desk and is told that their is a high profile case that is in New York and they want her to investigate. It has been a year since she moved to DC and is elated in seeing her comrades again. However this is not the case, for when she returns she finds the rest of the crew have moved on. Ryan, wanting more stability in his life, at the behest of Jenny and their new child, has been promoted to lieutenant and is embedded in more paperwork than cases. Esposito, leaves the NYPD and has found himself in the NY branch of the FBI with a focus on the military industrial complex. Laney, is away in Indonesia volunteering with the WHO and won't return for a few months. When Beckett tries to reunite the old crew, they push her away due to their own lives and their feelings on how he caused a rift in the team. When she tries to find comfort in Castles arms she learns that he has not returned since the day after he left for DC. When she asks Martha, who is the only person living in the apartment, where he is she states she hasn't been in contact with him for over 8 months but the place has been paid for. She then tries to find out through Alexis but she states that he doesn't to talk to her and that she broke his heart and that she too hasn't seen him in a long time. 

Beckett heartbroken then returns to the hotel and is greeted by her new DC team and they begin the breakdown of what they are there to investigate. This fades to Ryan who is deep in paperwork being greeted by Esposito, a face he hasn't seen since his childs birth. They begin talking about Beckett and the old times, and Ryan makes a comment on how great the team was. Esposito solemnly looks at him and the two don't talk until they agree to talk about Castle. Both of the men note that neither has seen nor heard from him in months and that the scheduled Nikki Heat novel has been delayed. As they both begin to settle in Captain Gates calls Ryan to her office and asks him to lead the investigation of a high profile missing person and that he has to play ball with an FBI liaison. He shows up at her last known location and finds both Esposito and Beckett already there. The three begin working together, with Beckett giving the rundown of what the Attorney General knows with Ryan and Esposito doing the same with their respective departments. Esposito explains to Ryan that he was ""promoted"" to liaison due to his behavior as an investigator in the military and his laissez faire attitude when it came to the soldiers. As they try to peace together what the motives for the disappearance are they see a heavily cloaked man with a beard at the scene and begin to walk toward him. He then makes a desperate sprint which ends with Beckett tackling him on the ground. To her surprise when she turns him around it's Castle. 

Castle, now in the NYPD lock room, is interrogated by Beckett about his whereabouts and what he is doing at a crime scene. He retorts and the two have a very personal conversation about how she never gave him a response and how he hasn't tried to contact her in over a year. This reaches it's zenith when Ryan bursts in with new information about the missing person. New evidence comes to light and they all stare at a board that they all once shared. Castle then spews a well grounded theory about why this person has gone missing, to the surprise of the rest of the gang. He then recants and spews an inane theory about alien abductions and government coverups. Esposito then makes a crack about government secrets. The crew then begin to to pack up when both Esposito and Beckett try to reach into their desks only to realize that they don't work there anymore. Castle calls shotgun with Esposito and the two ride off. 

A cut then has Beckett and Ryan discussing the rift in the team caused by Beckett and why she hasn't responded to Castle, with Ryan offering some advice. As they reach the last known location of the victim the scene then cuts to Esposito and Castle reaching a shady location. The two begin to discuss the happenings of the previous year with Castle lamenting on how he spent the year in isolation with Esposito claiming he was in the Bahamas and other tropical locations. While Castle retorts by saying Espo was tracking him, Espo makes a small facial gesture indicating he was, unbeknownst to Castle, but lies to Castle anyway. The two then begin to reconnect when Espo discovers the victims body. 

They CSU begins sweeping over the area with Beckett and Castle standing near each other but not speaking.  While evidence is being processed Pearlmutter begins making cracks at Castle, until eventually Backett has enough and tells him to finish up with the body. Castle thanks her and they begin talking again. As soon as they begin to reconnect, CSU unveils a critical piece of evidence, we see the spark of realization in their eyes and soon they have cracked the case. They begin to weave the tale one after another, rekindling their lost magic and then they storm off to the perpetrators location. Beckett then bursts in and begins grilling her victim, with the tenacity of a caged honey badger, she begins to slowly break him down until he squeaks he needs a lawyer.

Kate then thanks the old team stating that she needs to return to DC and that she appreciates their help. Castle then asks her out on a date and she declines stating that she will see him one day. A cut then shows her on a plane sitting with her team when she pulls out a necklace and begins to play with it revealing that there are two rings on it. A cut then takes her to her boss's office when he reveals to her that their is a new branch being opened up in New York and that she is going to be transferred there. She is reminded that she is self autonomous and that she will be given assignments relating to that area. She is told she may have a partner and is told to play nice with the other agencies there. She smiles and begins to walk away. A cut finds her outside Castle's apartment pacing. Her nerves racking she holds herself back as she wants to knock on the door but knows she can't. As this continues Martha looks at Castle, who is now clean shaven and properly dressed, and says to her stop torturing the poor girl and let her in. He then lets her in and she states she'll be in town for a while and that he owes her dinner. He smiles and says sure.  "	t5_2scog	True

Now Castle fans, stay with me on this. Yes, Castle is an amazing show with an amazing fan base, but in every other TV show, when the two main characters get together after years of sexual tension and contemplating their love for each other, the show ends one or two seasons later. I stopped to think that now there won't be any of that cute flirting between them nor either of them hinting that they want the other so desperately.

Nowadays Castle is more or less just there for quick wit. In the past this might've been passable since I'm sure for a lot of fans the main draw was the developing will-they-won't-they relationship brewing between Castle and Beckett but now that they're together...well, let's just say the rest of the show has been feeling a little bit lacking. That the latest episode featuring Ryan has been the most entertaining episode this season apart from the Sci-Fi convention really hits it home for me, especially considering we just came off of a two-parter dealing with Alexis, in which the case at hand was resolved first by a legendary russian merc, and then secondly, an aging CIA agent.
