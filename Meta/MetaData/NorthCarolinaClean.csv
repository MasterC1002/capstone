Yeah I understand Cheerwine is probably the thing that makes you guys most passionate right now because it is deeply red for the first time in a while and making massive changes to the legislative and social policy of the great state of NC, and that this likely is impacting most of your lives in a major way. But if you could just take your opinions about Cheerwine to the /r/soda sub or /r/cheerwine and pray that more than 10 people will show up on any given day, that'd be great and then I would feel much better.

The NC GOP has taken every opportunity to introduce bills this session that are about as right-wing as you can get. They have introduced several bills that made national headlines, and made NC look bad. They have introduced bills that they HAVE to realize are unconstitutional, and will go straight to the courts and cost the taxpayers of NC millions of dollars in court fees. They have made our state a laughing stock of the nation. They have introduced bills to [ban nipples](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H34), to [reduce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H451) the [voting](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S428) [rights](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S666) [of](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S721) [our](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S668) [citizens](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S667), and to [impose a 2-year waiting period for divorce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S518). They have [arrested peaceful protesters protesting these exact issues](http://www.wral.com/49-arrested-at-moral-monday-protest-at-state-legislature-/12441971). 

This will not do. We need to do something about this. Whether you are republican, democrat, or libertarian, something needs to change. 


So, what can we do about it?

**Run for office. Run as a democrat. Run as a republican. Just run.**


As of 5-13-13, according to the [NC Board of Elections](http://www.ncsbe.gov), there were 6,432,830 registered voters in North Carolina. Breakdown is as follows: 2,764,896 Democrats, 1,982,714 Republicans, 20,126 Libertarians, and 1,664,494 Unaffiliated. Only taking into account the two major parties, the Democrats have ~800,000 more registered voters than the Republicans. With as right-wing as the GOP has been lately, one could speculate that a good portion of the Unaffiliated would vote for the Dems. So why are we in the situation we are currently in? A few reasons.

**People didn’t vote.**

* Not in the numbers they should. 
Of the 7.5 million people old enough to vote, 6.5 million actually registered to do so. Of the 6.5 million voters in NC, only 4.5 million showed up. That was for the Presidential election. The number is disturbingly lower for the 2010 mid-term elections, with only 2.7 Million voting. --[Numbers come from NC BoE](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?ID=70)--

**People didn’t run.**




* There were at least [24 seats in the state house](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012) where Republicans ran unopposed, and at least [10 state senate seats](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_State_Senate_elections,_2012). (It is entirely possible that I missed a few)

**Senate seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 6 	– (Jones, Onslow) – Harry Brown (R)

District 10    – (Duplin, Johnston, Samson) – Brent Jackson (R)

District 29 	– (Moore, Randolph) – Jerry Tillman (R)

District 33 	– (Davidson, Montgomery) – Stan Bingham (R)

District 34 	– (Davie, Iredell, Rowan) – Andrew Brock (R)

District 35 	– (Union) – Tommy Tucker (R)

District 36 	– (Cabarrus, Union) – Fletcher Hartsell Jr. (R)

District 41 	– (Mecklenburg) – Jeff Tarte (R)

District 43 	– (Gaston) – Kathy Harrington (R)

District 48 	– (Henderson) – Tom Apodaca (R)

**House seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 14	– (Onslow) - George Cleveland (R)

District 15 	– (Onslow) - Phillip Shepard (R)

District 16 	– (Onslow, Pender) - Chris Millis (R)

District 28 	– (Johnston) - James Langdon, Jr. (R) 

District 52 	– (Moore) - James L Boles, Jr (R) 

District 59 	– (Guilford) - Jon Hardister (R) 

District 69 	– (Union) - Dean Arp (R) 

District 70 	– (Randolph) - Patricia Hurley (R) 

District 75 	– (Forsyth) - Donny Lambeth (R) 

District 76 	– (Cabarrus, Rowan) - Carl Ford (R) 

District 81 	– (Davidson) - Rayne Brown (R) 

District 82 	– (Cabarrus) - Larry Pittman (R) 

District 89 	– (Catawba) - Mitchell Setzer (R) 

District 90 	– (Surry, Wilkes) - Sarah Stevens (R) 

District 94 	– (Alleghany, Wilkes) - Jeffrey Elmore (R) 

District 95 	– (Iredell) - C. Robert Brawley (R) 

District 97 	– (Lincoln) - Jason R. Saine (R) 

District 103	 – (Mecklenburg) - Bill Brawley (R) 

District 104	 – (Mecklenburg) - Ruth Samuelson (R)

District 105	 – (Mecklenburg) - Jacqueline Schaffer (R)

District 108	 – (Gaston) - John A Torbett (R) 

District 111	 – (Cleveland) - Tim Moore (R) 

District 117	 – (Henderson) - Chuck McGrady (R) 

District 120	 – (Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Macon) - Roger West (R)	

There are 50 state senate seats and 120 state representative seats available. Yes, you will probably be facing incumbents, and no, you are not guaranteed a win, but **you can be part of a show of force.** Let the NCGA know that we, the people of North Carolina will not stand for this.

You don't have to run for the General Assembly, though. You can always run for Mayor, City Council, or County Commissioner. As long as you run. [Filing for municipal elections begins July 5th, and ends July 19th](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?id=61&amp;s=4)

**People aren’t involved enough.**

* I recently went to the Democratic Party Convention for my county. There were, perhaps, 15 people there. That’s it. Granted, I do live in a county that leans Republican, but that seems like little excuse for only 15 people. 

We need more people to get involved. Find a chapter of [Young Democrats](http://www.ydnc.org/) or [Young Republicans](http://www.ncfypr.com/associations.shtml) (If you are under 35 or 40, respectively). [Find your local Democratic Party](http://www.ncdp.org/local/county-party). [Find your local GOP party](http://www.ncgop.org/ncgop-by-county/) (as of this posting, that link is dead).  Go to facebook and look for your county group of the party of your choice, and ask them what you can do. Let them know that you plan on running.

-------

We have an opportunity coming up. We have a chance to tell the right-wing crazies that their legislation is not welcome here. We need to get them out of office. We need to get involved now. A good, albeit slightly dead, place to start is /r/RunForIt. 

2014 is right around the corner.

OscarJuno	73	6	28	"I don't like how our media is presenting pay concerns in the context of whether teachers get a ""raise"" or not. Teachers are asking for our pay to be *unfrozen* and eventually restored to previous levels. It's a significant distinction. 

[Here are two charts-- the left-hand graph shows 2009's pay scale, and the one on the right shows this year's pay scale.](http://i.imgur.com/eJM8s53.jpg) Note how in the new scale, teachers don't see any raise at all for the first five years of teaching (as far as I know, we're the only state in the union to offer no raises in that time frame). Also realize that all salaries have been frozen for six years. Meaning that if you were a new teacher six years ago, you'll still be paid starting salary for your 7th year of teaching. [As a result, average teacher salaries have fallen more in NC than in any other state.](http://i.imgur.com/2OfX5BD.jpg)

To put that in real terms, when I was hired as a teacher I was told I'd be making $38,190 by this upcoming school year. Instead, I'll be making $30,850. My county adds about $1,500 to that, but there are plenty of counties that add nothing. Picture yourself a talented person with a math or science degree, making $31k after 8 years on the job; how long would you wait around? We're losing teachers, and the talented ones will be the first to leave.

Teachers understand that sacrifices had to be made to balance the budget during the recession, but revenues have increased, and our legislators had other priorities. "	t5_2qhmx	True

I'm sure some, if not most, of you have heard of this already. On May 8th, there will be a vote to add Amendment 1 to the NC Constitution. That amendment is to ban same sex marriage:

This section does not prohibit a private party from entering into contracts with another private party; nor does this section prohibit courts from adjudicating the rights of private parties pursuant to such contracts.""

This amendment is religiously motivated and has no business in our state constitution. In fact, nothing that oppresses a certain group of individuals has a place in any constitution.

NC has always leaned to the right, and while I consider myself a liberal, NC's right-wing has always been fairly rational.  

Now we're dropping federal unemployment despite having the fifth WORST jobless rate in the country.  We're banning Sharia law because you know how much the Taliban's been trying to run the court system here.  We're restricting abortions by sneaking it through the state Senate like a thief in the night.  We're slashing education because Art Pope wants more Mexican kids in the fields picking sweet potatoes and tobacco.  When people protest these radical, needless, and downright underhanded practices and policies, they're labelled ""morons"" and ""crap"" by their elected representatives.  

Since they're going after your voting rights as well, I feel like I should remind you folks:  NC general elections are being held on November 4th, 2014.  If you have to crawl through broken glass to get to a polling station (and if the NC Senate has their way, you will), you need to get your vote out.

These fools in our state legislature are mostly one-term fools.  Make sure it happens."	t5_2qhmx	True

Here's what NC Senator Josh Stein (D,16) said: ""Today the Senate Republicans voted to fire 4,500 teacher assistants, eliminate another 4,500 teacher and 275 school counselor positions, raise class size, increase tuition on community college students, cut need based financial aid for nearly 10,000 university students, cut 2,500 pre-K slots, and eliminate nearly $50 million in proven economic development organizations, such as Biotech Center and Rural Center. They did all these cuts so that they could pay for $770 million in tax cuts for the well-to-do among us. This is a terrible choice that reflects upside down priorities.

I'm hoping to get some support from fellow redditors and rally together to draw attention to this matter, gather strength in numbers, have our voice heard by our representatives, and hopefully have an influence on their vote. North Carolina is the last state in the south that still recognizes domestic partnership's benefits. This bill would ban all recognition of those benefits and will be held in May. Please help in keeping equality within NC and as an example to surrounding states. The following links further explain the bill and then the second link is to help contact your house and senate representative to state your opposition to the bill.

Here are a few things (just a few) that have been making the headlines in this state:

* getting rid of tenure for teachers
* restrictions on abortion clinics
* restrictions on voting (but increasing limits of contributions and making it easier to conceal where contributions come from)
* Same -Sex marriage being denied (This is OLD news, but when you combine it with the rest... UGH!)

His complaint was made after reading a blog post on tumblr (http://therant905.tumblr.com/post/47047197931/good-job-mike-not-really).  Stone then found out that the men responsible for such a tame blog had a weekly radio show on WDCC a college station at Central Carolina Community College and called the governing body of the school to demand a suspension.

In an idiotic move the school agreed and suspended the show.

So far Stone hasn't responded to any of this and we are only left with the fact that a politician threw the first amendment out the window because he got his feelings hurt.

CITATION: http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-oew-lynn-stanley23-2008sep23,0,2226105.story: 

In its 1970 opinion in Walz vs. Tax Commission of the City of New York, the high court stated that a tax exemption for churches ""creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less than taxation of churches. [An exemption] restricts the fiscal relationship between church and state, and tends to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other."" The Supreme Court also said that ""the power to tax involves the power to destroy."" Taxing churches breaks down the healthy separation of church and state and leads to the destruction of the free exercise of religion.

*****************

Fellow redditors....

I'm a simple woman. I don't know much and I have few ideas or few resources. But I do have a thought.

What do you think.... If the Church is going to help change our state constitution... Why not start a movement that brings to light that the Churches are getting involved in State Politics, and yet aren't paying Taxes. And they SHOULD! 

Boy, I don't think they will be happy with this, but I know they are preaching from the pulpit! 

We can prove it with their newclippings, youtube clips etc...

Message:

&gt;Senator,
As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. McIntyre voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse.
I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this.
I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at The University of North Carolina.
Your younger generation of tar heels does not agree with these draconian laws as we understand CISPA.
Again, I plead to you to vote no on this bill.
I look forward to hearing back from you.


&gt;Best Regards,

Letterhead

     January 19, 2012

Dear Friend,

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns regarding the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011, more commonly referred to as the PROTECT IP Act of 2011.  I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

On May 12, 2011, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011 (S. 968) was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.  This bill would allow the Attorney General, or an intellectual property rights owner who has been harmed by an Internet site dedicated to infringing activities (ISDIA), also known as a rogue website, to take action against that site.  A site would be designated as an ISDIA if their sole purpose is to facilitate copyright infringement, or promote or sale of counterfeited American works.

A recent study suggests that copyright piracy alone costs the American economy as much as $58 billion a year and countless jobs.  I strongly support the goal of reducing the theft of intellectual property that is so important to North Carolina's economy, including our budding film industry, which is why I and 40 of my bipartisan cosponsors originally cosponsored this legislation last July.

As with all proposed legislation, legitimate concerns have been raised about some of the specific provisions in this bill.  I believe that supporters and opponents of the bill, all of whom agree, after all, on the need to combat the theft of American intellectual property, should work together to address those concerns.  As you may know, the Senate is scheduled to begin consideration of this legislation later this month, and I intend to approach the debate and amendment process with an open mind. Through a full and robust debate, I believe we can improve the legislation, ultimately reaching an agreement that will protect intellectual property without limiting innovation and creativity or creating unintended consequences.

Again, thank you for contacting my office. It is truly an honor to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate, and I hope you will not hesitate to contact me in the future should you have any further questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Signature

Kay R. Hagan

Call me a white knight, call me naïve, whatever. This is inappropriate, and if no one else is going to say anything I'd like to at least be on the record saying shame on the instigators of conflict from both sides. 

I've seen lots of negativity and petty name calling coming from both sides of the political spectrum over truly mundane things here, and we need to tone it back. Opportunities for mutual understanding have been squandered. Democrats bashing Republicans, conservatives demeaning liberals, and everything in between. It isn't productive, it isn't good for the community and, above all else, it's not what North Carolina stands for. This is a state of growth, progress, common sense, and moderation. Don't validate the media's negative portrayal of our state by bashing one another with only the slightest provocation.

Most importantly, and this is what really frustrates me with all this, hateful/insulting conversations drive away moderate individuals from both sides of the aisle. They don't want to get involved. After all, politics in NC is starting to look like a topic where people call each other names and throw reason out the door. Disagree with someone? ""You don't deserve my respect. FUCK. YOU."" Dare to voice a differing (and usually conservative) opinion? See you after 30+ downvotes. Who wants to learn more about a process, and in turn become more educated and perhaps join your side of the argument, when the people currently involved can't treat each other better than two chimps fighting over table scraps?

I'd like to see us welcome intelligent discourse, debate, and conversation over our differences. I appreciate reading educated posts and discourse from different viewpoints/stances because it helps me understand them. I may not agree, but if we both address each other reasonably we can learn something new. Reddit is not serious business, but it can be an opportunity to learn a new thing or two about someone different than you. We should be seizing that opportunity in this subreddit, and I hope our regulars will take it to heart and make people feel more welcome.

Sorry for my rant/response. **TL;DR: We are not talking very nicely to each other when we disagree. We should see it as an opportunity to learn something, because it's more productive that way.**"	t5_2qhmx	True

 Jesus was actually very clear on the subject of politics - not in that he was on the ""right"" or the ""left"", but rather he abhorred the idea of believers trying to turn faith into law at all. 

 The most profound example of this is a story we all know well. In Jesus's time, the Roman authority would actively seek out, suppress, arrest and even put to death the followers of Christ. Literally, as a Roman citizen your tax dollars went to killing Christians. The pharisees knew this so they asked Jesus should we pay our taxes. Jesus dismissed them saying ""render unto Ceaser what is Caesers"". 

 Why would Jesus tell his followers to pay taxes to a government that kills them, or later in Romans would Paul tell us to obey the authorities even when we disagree, or Jesus rebuke Peter for striking the arresting authorities? Why would Jesus do this???

 Because it doesn't matter. If you stop a gay couple from getting married because you passed a law, you have done nothing for them or their souls. If you stop a woman from having an abortion because of a law, you havent changed her mind, only her actions. 

 If politics mattered, Jesus would have had his followers raging against the Roman authorities. In fact, many dismissed Jesus as the Christ and Messiah precisely because he was not leading a rebellion. But Jesus knew that he was fighting for our salvation from sin, and you dont do that with legislation or referenda.

 Here is the sad truth. Our preachers have become modern day pharisees. They have become convinced that God will judge us by our government, rather than our convictions. They are asking you the same question they asked Jesus. How should we vote? Should we pay our taxes to an unfit government or should we try to change that government. Jesus gave a profound answer to that question - a definitive NO.

 So today, I will do what Jesus would do. I will vote no."	t5_2qhmx	True

10:35 pm

Saw all 3 again this evening!
I tried to get a photo/video and could see nothing on the video but I got a little spec in a picture so I'll upload it.

I paid particular attention to detail this time so I can describe it more accurately:

A perpetual light blue light on the underbelly
3 lights in a triangle formation around the blue light:
The ""top of the triangle"" light was blinking only white and the timing was different from the ""bottom"" two lights that blinked in synch and alternated between red and white.

That's all I got.


EDIT: 
I e-mailed the ACLU in Raleigh... So i'll post any feedback they provide.
Also it's 9:43 so I'm setting up shop on the porch... I'll try to get a photo if I see anything.
Thanks for all the feedback so far.  Here's a few interesting links I came across the past day:

Anyone else seen these bad boys flying around at night (or day)?

I've seen them between 10-11PM on both occasions

Both times I witnessed these, there were multiple (2x around the 10th of this month, 3x this evening), seemed like they were being driven by drunk drivers around in wide circles/making jagged u-turns.  I always noticed at least 4 lights (one being in the center of the body on the belly.)  First time, I heard what sounded like a faint lawn mower, tonight I heard nothing but VERY light wind (whooshing) sounds.

This comment on the 'article' is what got me:

""UAV's are unmistakable. You will know when you see one because of the irregular light pattern. Also, at altitudes as low as you see these irregular, moving lights, you would most definitely hear noise as you normally do when planes fly that low. These are inaudible unless they are landing most likely. You will also catch 3-4 in the sky at the same time if you have a good view of the night sky. When you see these 3 or 4 come together and ""huddle"", then you will know FOR SURE you are not seeing airplanes. At least I for one have never seen any airplanes come that close to one another on purpose.""

EDIT: This is the best example I could find, although it frequently changes between whirring, vibrations, propeller/engine/Hagrid's Motorcycle, Harmonic ""beeps"", etc.:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP0ZrI2iadk


Not trying to be all conspiracy-y, but I've heard this noise... it sort of sounds like an odd whirring noise or like there's a far-off transfer truck on a highway, but it is clearly coming from above.

I've heard it on and off for a few days now.
Lasts anywhere from 5-25 minutes.  Alternates in intensity... 

Currently going on right now [6:15am] and has been since I came outside around 6.

Anyone else hearing this shit?

Update:  7:20am... still going strong.

Upupdate:  8:55am... Strange noise is sounding like vibrations and sometimes has a ""pulse""-like sound.  I am also starting to notice a high-pitched skreechiness.  Seems to get audibly louder for a moment, then fade out, over and over.  I still have no idea what this is.
Whatever it is almost sounds like an old plane flying way too fast overhead, but we are approaching a solid 3 hours of this and I have witnessed nothing fly by.

9:22... Sounding a little rumbling.  Going to upload at least 3 videos as it has continued to change throughout the morning.  I suggest earbuds.  Will post links in a bit.

Like I said... definitely recommend earbuds in order to hear it.

Update:  So, we're approaching noon... Going on 6 consecutive hours of hearing these noises  now.  It's been clear, blue skies all morning but there are some storm clouds approaching.... we'll see if it affects this weirdness at all."	t5_2qhmx	True

1358691199.0	16xgtq	What happened at the Dixie Classic gun show? Please put politics aside to help me get informed.		36	10	13	"For those of you who do not know, it is being [widely reported](https://www.google.com/news?ncl=dJkBVoIxCKtTV9MPpEEnvweWm2c_M&amp;q=raleigh+gun+show&amp;lr=English&amp;hl=en) that multiple people were injured yesterday at the Dixie Classic gun show when a firearm accidentally discharged.

I was at the Dixie Classic at the time the incident occurred. Without getting into the news reports, I want to recount the events to you exactly as I experienced them. I'm also going to be completely honest right from the start: The reason I am making this post is that I have some doubts as to whether the news reports being circulated are an accurate reflection of the facts.

I was standing in line with hundreds of other people outside the Jim Graham building. I could not see inside the building, but I was within thirty feet of it and within about fifty feet of the entrance.

A siren went off, and three vehicles drove past the line up to the building. The vehicles were as follows: One SUV with police lights mounted on the inside (that is, an ""unmarked"" police vehicle), one large fire marshal's vehicle which I believe was medical in nature, and one regular ""police car."" No other law enforcement or medical vehicles of any kind ever appeared.

Several minutes later, the line in front of me began to disperse. I and several others around me advanced forward in line until moments later, a person waving their hands came forward and said, ""It's over. Somebody got shot. The show is canceled."" This person then indicated that he was recounting what officials inside had said to him --- he did not witness the shot.

I chose to remain in line along with about fifty other people, while most folks went home. As we advanced to the front, multiple other people came out of the building. They conveyed to us exactly this story: A gun was in the process of being unloaded when it accidentally fired. One man was shot through the hand, and there was a ricochet, which caught another man.

After a few minutes, a man was brought out on a stretcher, with blood and bandages on his hand. The blood was concentrated in the middle of his palm, and everything I saw supported the claim that he was indeed shot through the hand.

I advanced to the entrance of the Jim Graham building and looked inside. I did not see any other injured people, although I could not get a clear view of the entire interior of the building. I remained at the entrance for another twenty minutes. During this time, security officials entered and exited the building, but I saw no medical professionals, and no other injured people exited the building.

When I got home after the event, I immediately Googled for news stories. I wish now that I had taken screenshots of the stories I read. There were multiple stories from multiple sources which declared explicitly that two men were hurt. They said that a _law enforcement officer_ had been trying to secure the trigger of the gun with a zip tie when it discharged. I am not supplementing this story with my own narrative; that is exactly what the news reported.

It was not until multiple hours later that the news stories were updated. Now they all say that three individuals were shot: Two men, and one woman. Furthermore, they say that the gun owner, _not_ a law enforcement officer, discharged the gun, and that he was attempting to unzip the gun's carrying case when it went off. Lastly, they say the woman was shot in the torso and (from what I can gather) wounded quite substantially.

I have the deepest respect and concern for the severity of this situation, and I do not wish to in any way trivialize or disrespect the injuries and trauma this woman has suffered. However, _I cannot logically reconcile the official reports with the events that I personally witnessed._ I cannot understand how only one medical vehicle was brought to the scene in the over thirty minutes I was standing there, if indeed three people were shot. I cannot understand how in all the time I was near the entrance talking to people going in and out of the building, all of them consistently reported that two men had been shot, if indeed a woman was shot in the torso. Furthermore, I am confused by the ""oddly specific"" nature of the initial reports that turned out to be false.

Can anyone provide me with any additional information about what happened at the Dixie Classic gun show?"	t5_2qhmx	True
1352511809.0	12y0j3	I know this isnt North Carolina r4r, but I need a short notice date to the Marine Corps Ball... (crosspost from r/Wilmington)	BallDateThrowaway	44	17	11	"Hi all,

So I thought I had a date, but she has flaked out on me. I'm tall, thinnish, tattooed, and by virtue of my 31 years of age I'm not one of those guys you see wearing camouflage backpacks in the mall or flaunting dogtags and a bad haircut at the beach.

I'm looking for a girl who falls somewhere between cute and beautiful, 20-30, for the big formal Marine Corps Ball next Friday the 16th here in Wilmington. It would be a great time if you like history, current events, getting all dressed up, the soft tinkling of military medals, drinking, above average food, or just tossing yourself out of your comfort zone. Like I mentioned in my real (albeit unfruitful) r4r a couple of days ago, I dont really care about your politics or world view, be you a conservative sunday school teacher or a dreadlocked hippy. I'm genuinely not looking for anything more than some platonic company so I dont have to sit next to an empty chair.

Dont own a dress? I'll buy you one. If you already have one I'll help you accessorize it. Want to get to know each other a little first? I think that's a great idea too. This is a throwaway account but I'll happily share my regular one after a little conversation so you can stalk away.
If this sounds like you or one of your friends, feel free to drop me a line, and thanks for your time either way!"	t5_2qhmx	True

The Republicans in the General Assembly say that it is necessary to ensure faith in our electoral process by preventing voter fraud.  While I could accept (not support) a provision requiring an ID to vote, they went too far by limiting the forms of ID for purely partisan reasons.  Likewise the rest of the bill appears to be a long list of electoral processes clearly designed to affect Democrats more than Republicans.

•	Requiring Voter ID – 319,000 NC voters currently lack the proper ID.  The Elderly, Blacks, and Hispanics are more likely to lack acceptable ID and are also more likely to vote for the Democrat.
•	Restrictions on Early Voting – 56% of NC voted early in 2012 and the majority of those voters were Democrats.  Obama led by 200,000 votes before Election Day.  This provision will result in longer lines at the polls.
•	Elimination of Same-Day Registration – Used by 96,000 NC voters in 2012, again a majority of them were Democrats.
•	Elimination of Straight-Party Voting - In 2012, 1.4 million voters used the straight-party ticket and 61% were for the Democrats.
•	Ending Pre-Registration – NC high schools proactively helped students pre-register to vote which greatly encourages young people to vote.  Democrats won the youth vote with 67%.

Other provisions encourage vigilante poll watchers, increase campaign contributions, and limit campaign finance disclosure requirements.  The vast majority of this Republican bill directly attacks their political rivals.   The party crying voter fraud has decided to create fraudulent elections.

1372168294.0	1h1c46	Regarding the NC Politics vote	matticusrex	44	20	28	"I thought reddit was a place where people could come to their local subreddits and have meaningful conversations about things that affect their lives and communities?  I understand that this place has a heavy liberal bias, but a lot of the posts that I see get buried are also poor quality in terms of actual discussion - lots of 1 liners, intentionally offensive remarks, name calling.  If you don't believe me the proof is right there, just go look through some of the biggest posts of the last year or so -- yes there are buried posts but not a lot of high quality buried posts.

I know it can be hard on the people with opinions that are less popular on reddit.  But this is where you have to step it up and really make compelling arguments supporting what you believe.  I see it all the time where rediquette wins out.  You just have to put some effort into your argument, which is sometimes hard because it forces you to really examine what you believe.  We all hold irrational beliefs, hiding them away in a new community doesn't help ourselves or anyone else.

I have no doubt that this poll will come out with at least some form of political discussion allowed.  It's the responsible thing to do, to keep up with what your state leadership are doing, and spread the word to others if appropriate.  If you're responding to these threads and getting downvoted, check the quality of your posts and not your political view.  

Lastly, the 3rd option of a weekly/daily politics thread really doesn't seem to be a good option.  Perhaps politics self-only posts to stave off some sensational headlines.  I'm personally not in favor of mods deleting content at all.  I'm subscribed to /r/ncpolitics, it's a great idea and will get plenty of traffic, but it **cannot** exist simply to replace politics discussion in this subreddit.  /r/NorthCarolina will always have more traffic.  This is an incredibly short-sighted and juvenile way to administrate a user group, and the mods that initiated this should be ashamed of their knee-jerk reaction to this issue."	t5_2qhmx	True

If your goal IS to drive out conservative-minded Tar Heels from this sub, roger, good to go. But reddit, like the country, is supposed to be a community of plural beliefs and interests. If you believe in tolerance and civil discourse, then that should be the rule here too.

Conservatives are also guilty in some regard of being overly defensive. But please, take it down a notch and let's remember that we are all fellow citizens in a beautiful state.

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We're currently in WV for the next few days and will next head into NC for what is likely a 10 day stretch. 

* [Breakfast with Strangers site](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Our goal is to make stops in Asheville, Charlotte, The Research Triange, Greenville, and a little stop here and there (dates soon). If interested please email us at: breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'North Carolina' in the subject line. Some voices we'd love to hear from: academic, musicians, nurses, mail carrier, and a stay at home mom but we're open to all. :)

**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

I give him the go ahead. The next day he calls me and gives me a list of prices that are extremely high. I tell him that i want to get a second opinion and that i will there to pick up my car. He then tells me that i have to get the transmission rebuilt there because they already have it taken apart and if i want to go somewhere else that i would have to pay another $400 just to put it back together. The total now is $940. The price he gave me was $2690 plus i could get a $200 off coupon from his website. I was told the car would be taken care of and be done no later than Monday. Monday at 4:00 p.m. i have not received any word on my vehicle, no professional courtesy letting me know that the vehicle won't be ready until the next day.

So far we've found gem mining, hiking, and water falls to visit that are local to the Franklin area. There's also Tweetsie Railroad, which we've been to years ago, and will be visiting again. We thought about visiting somewhere on the Atlantic since we've never seen it, but that's almost an 8 hour drive from Franklin (if you stay in NC).

So, whaddya got?

EDIT: Places to eat too, as some have already mentioned. I'm a BBQ kind of guy, so that's definitely on my list to try.

* What's it like living in North Carolina? More specifically, we'll be living somewhere in and around MCAS Cherry Point, so what's it like out there? 
* What's something I absolutely have to do/eat/experience/try while I'm in North Carolina? We're going to be stationed there for three years at the least, so I want to get out and explore this new home of mine.

I really want to visit the [battleship](http://www.battleshipnc.com/) in Wilmington and hang around there so awesome places we can eat would be good to know(I love fast food. But I dont mind spending money for some good food). 

I know theres a bunch of golf clubs in the area, I really want to try golf, any recommendations on which one?

I read you guys have nice parks/mountainy stuff, I like nature, recommendations on that too?

I'm open for all suggestions I really love learning stuff and having fun!

My wife has always wanted to visit North Carolina, so I wanted to take her there for a vacation/anniversary trip in the spring. Long way off I know but it pays to be prepared. We are 25. A bar scene isn't very important; we aren't huge drinkers. 

We are coming from Indianapolis and plan to make a stop in Concord to watch the NHRA 4-wide drag race there then head to the coast for the rest of the week. Looking at a map, Wilmington appears to be the biggest town along the coast, which may let us do plenty of shopping and scuba diving during our trip. I found Stemmerman's Inn on Front St that looked like a nice place to stay. 

Just looking for advice on if Wilmington is the best option on the NC coast for shops (big and small), beaches, scuba diving, and possibly bicycles/running.

1336587052.0	tf1fp	Hold your head up, North Carolina.	PRzitremedy1	20	5	5	"We turned out in mass yesterday to stand against oppression and, as expected, it wasn't enough. Be proud that you voted, protested, petitioned and amplified your voice because the tide that is coming is giant and there's no shame in not conquering it right away.

It was never about homosexuals, family, God, or values. For them, the politicians posing as preachers, historians, and free-thinkers, it's much larger. Their goal is to religify any secular issue they can, create an army or god-fearing pawns to vote them into power, and crush a few civil liberties along the way.

Bringing the secular sphere of politics to a religious realm is disastrous. It turns reasonable, logical debate into a circus arena of circlethink and assumption. By convincing a huge mass of people that we live in a Christian Nation and that to oppose the conservative platform is to oppose God, they eradicated the need for logical argument. North Carolina, we had no chance.

So brace yourself for the cousin-kissin' bass-ackwards hick jokes that will surely come. Be aware that these jokes and insults are only capable of putting the religious right on defense-bolstering their ill founded faithlogic--and of ramming the feed-stick of defeat down the throats of those who tried to fight this amendment. Don't hide your head in the sand, we need your head to be held high so we can keep up the fight.

Paddle out to Bear Island and get sand in your hair. Look up at the stars and the full moon casting a hazy circle around the entire sky. When the crashing waves of the morning tide wake you up, cast a line into the surf and be proud to be in North Carolina.

Or take a hike over the Black Balsam Ridge and let the 360 degree view from a 6000 foot bald peak remind you that our state wasn't defeated it just took a step back, and we need to turn it forward.  When you come down from the ridge, hitchhike back to your car.  I never find it difficult to get a ride from someone in the Appalachians.  Offer to put gas in his/her tank but (s)he'll refuse...the stories you both shared on the short ride were payment plenty.

We might feel small and backwards after yesterday's vote, but we are not. There's no need (or excuse) to stop being heard now. so keep our voice loud. North Carolina, we gave the world Nappy Brown and Link Wray....We don't owe them shit!

They need to find at least a 3 bedroom house (there are other children) with a bedroom/den/any room on the first floor. So far they have found apartments and town homes.

I'm curious to hear about anything you find interest in and think more people should know about that happens in NC; whether it be something to glorify or to revolt, a place, an organization, deviance, a small business, something art related, a call to action, a movement, or even a specific individual.  No limitations, just something, anything that has left an impression on you in North Carolina.  Specifics are a plus, but I'm all ears for anything!

My reasoning for asking is because I'm a film student at UNC Wilmington with a focus in Documentary filmmaking.  I'd really love to create something that not only informs, but will genuinely interest the audience, and make them think, ""Wow, I never knew this existed in my state.""

1319484496.0	lnfxs	[x-post from r/randomkindness] consider helping out this small businessman.	sdneidich	12	2	4	"This post is about a man named Dan Middleton. Dan is the owner of a small auto shop in Charlotte, NC, where I get my car serviced. You can check out their website here: http://www.touringcarinc.com/
Dan has a blood disease that has evaded diagnosis. The cause is unknown, but the chief symptom is that he is not producing enough red blood cells. Because they can't fix the problem, the only treatment they have had success with so far is getting him transfusions. He has been getting them every couple weeks for about a year- Or at least he had, until his insurance reached the maximum allowable benefit. I don't know the exact details, but I do know there is a 60 day period where he can not afford treatment, and is not covered by any insurance. So, he is not able to get treatment.
I saw him last week, and he is getting worse... he was somewhat lethargic, pale and jaundiced.
What I am asking is a few things: 1. If you live in the Charlotte NC area, and have a european car, take it to this guy for service. Dan runs a great shop, and having his business do a bit better would probably help take a load off. They also are a lot cheaper than the dealerships (at least for Mercedes), and do as good or better quality work. 2. If you are able and feel so inclined, find the business address on the website and send him a check so that he can get some medical treatment. 3. If you feel so inclined, write a letter to your congressman telling them about this man, who has worked all his life, owns his own business, and because he got sick is unable to afford health insurance. The health insurance system is failing this middle class guy, and endangering his life.
I wish I could help this guy out, but I am trying to live off a graduate student's stipend, so the only thing I was able to do for him was #1 and #3, as well as write my local paper hoping that they carry the story.

1303142540.0	gstzu	I need your help, North Carolina, about getting the same speeding ticket given to 5 different cars at once.	so_say_we_all	15	3	19	"So there were a group of five of us, two with radar detectors, and both of them said our group was only lit up with radar once when the cop was driving south (as we drove north).  A few minutes later, he came up behind us, drove past the first four cars, got behind our leader to pull him over.  The second car in line, tried to pass the cop on the left, but the cop blocked him, and the rest of us just pulled over behind the leader.  He gave us all the same ticket, but we all have a hard time believing that he can prove that he caught each one of us with his radar gun.   

So, North Carolinians- if we all pitch in to get a lawyer, do you think we have a shot to overturn at least one of the tickets?  Our goal is to get the judge to confine the ticket to one car, and we would all chip in for the ticket and legal fees.  Our car, in particular, was fourth in line, and we saw the cop before the radar detectors picked anything up, so we were slowing down before the three cars in front of us.  I would appreciate any advice you could give!

Disclaimer:  Please keep the anti-speeding rhetoric to a minimum if you could, it was an open highway, and our group of cars is not made up of douches who would endanger anyone."	t5_2qhmx	True

As a NC educator with nearly 20 years experience, I am dismayed when I consider the steady decline in the regard for North Carolina's public education system. The current budget proposal further undermines the morale of NC's educators and conveys an inherent message that educators are of no value to the North Carolina public and our children. I cannot, nor will I ever, understand how government officials can not support the advanced education achievements of its teachers. Everyday, teachers across NC talk with their students about the importance of a good education and they do this while elected officials say just the opposite.


The budget proposal only emphasizes the steady devaluation of what should be among the most respected professions. Who goes to school? Everyone...the cashier at Food Lion, the dentist that cleans your teeth, the doctor who diagnoses cancer in your mother, the plumber who fixes your toilet. With the exception of a small percentage, we all start our education in the public schools.


In this budget, 9,306.5 education positions will be eliminated--5,184.5 teachers, 3,850 teacher assistants, and 272 Support Personnel (guidance counselors, psychologist, etc.). It also includes the further reduction of textbook funding by $77 million, school supplies by $46 million, the discontinuation of teacher tenure and the elimination of the Teaching Fellows program while allotting $50 million for school vouchers. This clearly indicates that those currently in elected positions have no idea what our teachers do each day in the public schools. Who will want to teach in NC? In six short years, we have dropped from 25th in the nation to 46th in teacher pay. Not only do you not value teachers currently in the classroom who will once again see no pay raise with this budget proposal, but without the Teaching Fellows program, you are sending a clear message that no one should consider teaching in NC as a career.


The children show up every August and their parents expect a highly qualified, passionate teacher to be in their children's classrooms. Enrollment increases annually in NC's schools which results in larger class size. Our teachers are using textbooks that stop with Bush's (the first Bush's) administration while their students sit in cracked, broken chairs. Parents want to know why there isn't a textbook for every student to take home. You can have discussions all day about alternate resources and the use of technology, but parents demand a book and blame administrators and teachers when there aren't enough books and supplies for every student. How about online textbooks? Do you really think every classroom is equipped with technology that includes laptops, iPads and computers and the infrastructure to support that technology? Free public education? Not exactly. NC's teachers are paying for the education of the state's children with their own money as they buy basic classroom supplies. I sincerely hope you will see the folly in this budget and the far reaching damage it will do to North Carolina's public schools."	t5_2qhmx	True

I'm looking to spend a few nights of the first week of September (during the week after labor day) on a solo camping/fishing trip for some much-needed ""me"" time.  

Want to do the South Core banks because it seems to be the most primitive area of the OBX.  I've done extensive fishing in the areas between Avon-Hatteras and Ocracoke, have spent time in Duck and Corolla so this is really the last area I've yet to explore.  

I've got a pretty good ""to do"" list prepared (been about 8 years since I've been camping so I'm prepping in advance), but a couple of questions:

* From a camping standpoint...are the beaches as wide there as they are throughout most of the OBX?  Mainly...will there be enough room to park the truck and camp without worrying about a high tide washing everything away?
* Is there a place on the island where I can buy ice?  This really seems like my biggest issue from a list-making standpoint, and I can't find any solid answers online.
* The ferry from Davis appears to be the best way to get there from Raleigh.  Are there any other vehicle ferries that may be a bit closer/easier?
* Can you purchase fishing licenses at ferry offices?
* What can I expect from a crowd standpoint...I'm sure if I stay over a weekend there will be a lot of fishermen there, but are there generally a lot of campers?  
* I generally use shrimp/mullet on the OBX, with shiny spinners for blues.  Will that work just as well here, or one a different type of bait be recommended since I'm further south than I've ever been?

I'm planning on getting there on a Tuesday and staying as long as the fishing is good.  If the fishing sucks, I've lways wanted to check out Portsmouth, and the Cape Lookout lighthouse is the only one in the state I've never been to aside from Oak Island.  Any other advice would be helpful...

I'm looking for a better understanding.	ampfin	11	2	34	"So I'm hoping someone will show me the other side of my understanding, and perhaps further my thought process on teacher's pay in NC. I look at it this way-teachers receive 10 weeks off in the summer. The receive 2 weeks off at Christmas. They get a spring and fall break (4-5 days each), Thanksgiving, Easter, and all other major holidays. This is in addition to annual leave and sick days (which they can accumulate and roll over from year to year). Add this all up and they are working less than 8 months a year. 

The base pay in NC is $30,000. All school districts offer a 6-15% supplement on top of that to attract the best teachers to their districts. So, if a brand new teacher earns $32,000 per year and they work 33 weeks (8 months)*45 hours a week they are making around $21.50 per hour. A teacher that has been working for many years, has their National Boards certification etc. can make around $65,000-70,000 per year, which equals out to $44 per hour.

Like most full time jobs, our teachers are offered health, vision, and dental insurance. They have access to a retirement plan, in addition to the NC pension plan (which they contribute their own money to), and other benefits. 

These seem like reasonable rates to be paid to our teachers IMO. I'm really and truly not looking for a flame war, just a better understanding of why everyone believes we need to drastically increase teacher pay."	t5_2qhmx	True

My dog, Tater, went missing on Saturday the 3rd of last week.  He has ran off before, but has typically came back either the same day or the following morning.  However, this time he has been gone for nearly a week so me an my family are worried.

I just thought I would see if any redditers are around the Boiling Springs area or might know someone around that area could keep an eye out for him and if you see home or know of his wherabouts, contact me at noblerooster@gmail.com.

The link is a picture of him I took a few days before he had ran off while playing in the yard.  Any help would be much appreciated."	t5_2qhmx	True

First, I'm a regular Sun Drop drinker. Odds are, you'll only share in my problem if you are too (though it's not exclusively so).

I've gotten a few 2-liter bottles recently (from my local Food Lion near UNCC) that honestly taste like a mixture of Sun Drop and 7-Up. As someone who loves the former and detests the latter, it isn't a lot of fun. The first 2-liter I encountered actually wasn't too bad, but it was a Sun Drop bottle that had enough 7-Up in it that you could actually *smell* the difference. The most recent bottle (3rd, over the past month or so) only had a hint of 7-Up, but it was still enough to ruin the Sun Drop taste.

So basically, has anyone else had a similar mix-up? Specifically with Sun Drop and 7-Up, less specifically with any other combo?"	t5_2qhmx	True

I moved to NC a few years back.  My TX issued drivers license didn't expire until 2012 so I didn't transfer it to NC right away.

I went in to the DMV this past Feb to go ahead and get a NC Lic before my TX lic was expired more than 1 year (one of the items listed on the NC DMV website that can be used is an out of state lic that is not more than 1 year expired).

I went through all the steps, took the test, even got my new NC lic number, however, right at the end, the person helping me told me I was on a Do Not Renew list and that TX had put a hold on me.

After some research, it turns out I had a traffic ticket I had forgotten about for running a stop sign.

When I spoke to the court clerk in TX, I was told that I needed to post bond, get a court date, then appear in court in TX... OR pay the $1,200 fine.

Now, my wife, when she got her NC lic, she took different forms of ID to the DMV and didn't present her TX lic at all.

I really don't want to go through the hassle of dealing with the TX ticket especially as it will fall-off next year.  

My question is, should I be able to return to the DMV and just use different forms of ID, especially since my TX lic is now over 1 year expired.. they wont even take it as valid proof, and just get a new NC lic?  

Or will I be forced to take care of the TX issue now since I've already been in the system once?"	t5_2qhmx	True
