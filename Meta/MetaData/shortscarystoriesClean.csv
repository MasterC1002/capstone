1359497102.0	17is3u	A Message from your Personal Demons	MrGarm	1334	168	48	"Hello, my dear. You do not know who I am, but I know you. I am one of the three demons that were assigned to you at birth. You see, some people in this world are destined for greatness, destined to live happy, fulfilling lives. You, I am afraid, are not one of those people, and it is our job to make sure of that. 

Who are we? Oh yes, of course, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce us:

*Shame* is my younger brother, the demon on your left shoulder. Shame tells you that you’re a freak; that those thought you have are not normal; that you will never fit in. Shame whispered into your ear when your mother found you playing with yourself as a child. Shame is the one who makes you hate yourself.                                            
*Fear* sits on your right shoulder. He is my older brother, as old as life itself. Fear fills every dark corner with monsters, turns every stranger on a dark street into a murderer. Fear stops you from telling your crush how you feel. He tells you it is better not to try than let people see you fail. Fear makes you build your own prison.

Who am I, then? I am the worst of your demons, but you see me as a friend. You turn to me when you have nothing else, because I live in your heart. I am the one who forces you to endure. The one who prolongs your torment.

Sincerely,

*Hope.*

He goes to bed at ten, every night. He says goodbye to his friends on the Internet and shuts his laptop down, like clockwork, and then he changes out of his clothes and goes to bed. He dreams, but never remembers what about. When he wakes up in the morning, he's always slept in, and he hurries to get to school in time. He gets home at thirty six minutes past three and does his homework, and then he returns to his laptop until bed. He likes gummy bears, horror films and music that has screamed vocals. He doesn't really have any friends apart from me, so he keeps some weed in his sock drawer for when the loneliness gets too much. He doesn't know what he wants to do after school, but he knows he wants to go and live in a big city. London, maybe. He's so sad because he doesn't realise how beautiful he is. I don't know what I'd be if I didn't love him like I do. I was nothing before him.

We've lived together for twelve months now, it's nice. I used to be one of those faceless people he speaks to online, until we both realised that we couldn't live with being so far away from each other. I moved to the other end of the country to be with him, I made so many sacrifices and I don't regret it at all. His parents are nice, but we just spent most of the time up in his room alone. We don't talk like we used to before I moved in, though. Most of the time I just watch him. It's how I know so much about him.

Tonight, his routine's changed. He doesn't touch the laptop, he just lies on his bed with his face in the pillow and cries. I was concerned, until I looked at his calendar and realised the date. Of course he's upset; it's been a year since I hanged myself."	t5_2t6kz	True

It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every respect except for the fact that it was counting down. ""That is all of the time you have left in the world, son. Use it wisely."" And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never afraid, for he knew exactly how much time he had left.

Eventually, the watch began its final countdown. The old man stood looking over everything he had done, everything he had built. *5*. He shook hands with his old business partner, the man who had long been his friend and confidant. *4*. His dog came and licked his hand, earning a pat on the head for its companionship. *3*. He hugged his son, knowing that he had been a good father. *2*. He kissed his wife on the forehead one last time. *1*. The old man smiled and closed his eyes.

Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood standing there, very much alive. You would think that in that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life, the man was scared.

There was just so much blood though. I mean, I expected blood, but there was A LOT of blood. I originally thought one bucket was going to be enough. I almost had three full now. I took a deep breath, bent the wire at a different angle and started again. Since she was unconscious I decide to go in farther. I get most of my hand in and start twisting. More blood flowed out, but so did most of a face. I figured I was making progress. I go deeper. My entire hand enters her. I had to fight off the urge to fuck her right then and there.

I had a family once; a loving wife, two wonderful sons. All of that is nothing more than a distant memory, now. These people came and took me from my home one morning, and they locked me away in this room. I beg them to let me leave this hellish place - to go home, to see my family again. All the heartless bastards do is shake their heads, offering insincere platitudes before shoving more needles into my veins.

They won't tell me what's going on, they just talk amongst themselves and poke and prod at the husk of what was once a man. I would give anything just to see my wife again, to kiss her one last time before the poison these monsters pump into me finally finishes the job.

The old crone is the worst part. She hovers over me incessantly, and refuses to answer when I shout demands to know who she is and what she wants from me. She simply holds my liver-spotted hands in hers, and silently cries.

No, not the sexy kind, but a foul creature with bony limbs and ashen skin? The kind that snarls as you enter, like a beast about to pounce? The kind that roots you to the spot with its sunken, hypnotic eyes, rendering you unable to flee as you watch the hideous thing uncoil from the shadows? Has your heart started racing though your legs refuse to? Have you felt time slow as the creature crosses the room in the darkness of a blink?

Have you shuddered with fear when it places one clawed hand atop your head and another under your chin so it can tilt you, exposing your neck? Have you squirmed as its rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your jaw, to your throat, in a slithering search that's seeking your artery? Have you felt its hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it probes your pulse—the flow that leads to your brain? Has its tongue rested there, throbbing slightly as if savoring the moment?

After driving for several hours from the nearest town, they discovered a lagoon, nestled beside a cliff ideal for diving. They set up camp in the woods nearby and spent the evening swimming in the warm, clear water. As the sun sunk below the trees, one of the friends went up to the highest point on the cliff and jumped off, while the other 5 watched. Their laughter slowly subsided as they waited for him to surface. It only took half a minute for them to dive in after their friend. Struggling and sputtering among the reeds in the lagoon, they searched hopelessly for him. Finally they disentangled themselves and came up, but they never saw their friend again. Heartbroken they returned to the city and passed a strange and lonely year in which their only solace was the knowledge that they would return to the lagoon to honour the anniversary of their friend's death. 

A year passed and they returned to the lagoon as a memorial, but as they approached they saw their friend standing there, head bowed. Excitedly they called to him and began running towards him, but he didn't turn. As they got closer they called him more desparately, but still to no avail. With joy they ran towards him, but stopped dead when they saw not one but five crosses on the waterside.

You should feel the nose first, and the toe second because of the way your nervous system is wired, it takes more time for the information to travel through the nervous system from your feet than your head, but that doesn't happen. So why are they simultaneous?

Your brain edits out the gap to avoid confusion. The nose-sensation is delayed from the conscious until the toe gets there, your consciousness is constantly behind what we can here refer to as 'real time', in case there are things that need to be removed from the scene. The system is constantly at work, weeding out information it deems unnecessary or harmful from the constant stream of information that would otherwise overwhelm you. Your brain actively shelters your mind by hiding things from it, things it deems you're better off not seeing, hearing or knowing.

It must have been torture – the stench of fear filled Sandy’s nostrils while the sharp tang of blood danced across her tongue.

All this triggered the usual feelings in Sandy: a powerful urge to help, the absolute conviction she was right, and a fierce protectiveness, as if the person she sensed was family. She tried her best to explain what she knew, but Rick, who usually believed her without question, ignored her this time. She couldn’t understand what was going on in his mind.

Oh, my. Bombs? Bystanders? *Children?* That’s… Never mind, just stand over there and wait for your balloon to pop. It’s gonna be a doozy. Not worried? Ah, you think “BOOM!” and it’s over. You’re already dead, so what’s the big deal, right? Well, here’s the thing about being dead – there’s nowhere else to go. And since it will take you a long, *long* time to pull yourself together (if you ever do), I’m afraid you’re going to feel the pain of every blasted, shredded chunk. No matter how far apart.

It wasn’t many days ago that my experiment met with an accident and I woke up to find myself in 1986. There was no way back, but I wasn’t worried – 1986 wasn’t so bad. All I had to do was keep my head down and avoid paradoxes. While getting rich, of course. I could finagle a new identity, find a job, and sink every spare cent into Microsoft, then Apple, and later Google. So I wandered the streets, making million dollar plans and chuckling at the fashions until I fell asleep on a park bench.

A few days after that, I awoke surrounded by a forest. 1986 had been feasible, but 1886 had tossed me out of my comfort zone, and then a forest? There weren’t even any people nearby. I felt less and less confident of my ability to survive as the shifts continued to send me exponentially further back in time whenever I slept. Sleep can be fought, but sleep always wins.

Today, I woke up in the middle of an ocean, and now that night has fallen I don’t recognize the constellations. It’s possible the land I knew is currently on the other side of the world, part of the Pangaea supercontinent, but I have no way to know. All I know is that I have a choice to make – I can float until I doze off, perhaps waking to glimpse an earth no one has ever seen while I burn on melting rocks or asphyxiate in an atmosphere of noxious gasses, or I can slip beneath the water here and now.

A day spent on the ocean is exhausting. I need to decide soon."	t5_2t6kz	True

You'd select a playlist, start running and in between songs it would insert missions. Simple stuff, collect imaginary supplies, find imaginary survivors, outrun imaginary zombies (when it told you zombies were on your tail, man, you had to really feel the burn to get away). Things like that, just enough to keep you running that little bit longer, to burn that extra calorie and inch.

I'd take it into the woods behind my house. Kiss my girlfriend goodbye and set off. On one run though, it pushed me really hard. Zombie attack after zombie attack. But I kept running. I kept pounding my feet until my muscles burned and my chest tightened and I had to resist the urge to vomit. My heart and head were pounding, my feet were aching and the sweat poured over my forehead and stung my eyes. Before long I barely knew where I was in those woods.

We’ll begin it with the long curling locks that frame his face like a portrait. He is handsome but humble, speaks little of himself, and is unflinchingly truthful at all times. Naturally, the ladies of the land are quite taken with him, and the Queen most of all. She makes him her lover, thrilled to be called beautiful by such an honest young man.

She is a vain queen, though, known to summon dark powers in hopes of warding off age. After gifting her lover with eternal youth, she discovers one cannot give such gifts to oneself – when she tries, the dark powers rebound upon her, twisting her. Not outwardly, but her heart is turned cold, and if ever she looks at her own reflection, her vision is made to fracture and facet like that of a greedy fly. Unable to see the truth with her own eyes now, the more her lover calls her beautiful, the more she suspects he is lying.

Eventually, in a fit of anger at his mockery, she pushes our hero from a tower window. Her bewitchments ensure he does not die, but a thousand shards of glass pierce his body and he shatters every bone as he crashes through the mirrored dome above her throne room and falls to its marble floor. The spiteful queen has him run through with a hook and hung on a wall to set an example, and it’s only then, when she catches sight of her many reflections in the jagged glass splinters impaling his limp form, that she sees she *is* still beautiful. And forever after, she will believe him when she asks, “Who is the fairest in the land?”

It was a black box, sealed with clear tape and had a white UPS Next Day Air label.   I was curious. I brought the box in, set it on the coffee table and then, using the key to my car, cut open the tape. 

Inside the box were the following things:

- A full black face mask with holes for the eyes and mouth cut out 
- A roll of duct tape
- A length of brown rope (probably six feet long)
- A length of wire (twice as long as the rope)
- A pack of razor blades
- A working flashlight
- A box of matches
- A can of lighter fluid
- A small crowbar
- A pair of handcuffs
- A big knife (with a blade that was sharp on one edge and serrated on the other) in a leather sheath 
- A legal sized white envelope stuffed full with twenty dollar bills
- A photo of me 

Immediately went to grab my phone to call the cops when the doorbell rang. I was a little freaked out, so I slid on the chain before I opened it. I didn't recognize the guy standing there; he said he was the nephew of my next door neighbors and he was staying with them for a little while.  He said that he came over because he'd just gotten off the phone with UPS; it seems the package he was expecting from New Mexico this morning was mistakenly addressed with my house number.

you may have asked yourself where I've been the last week. Do you remember when mom used to tell Ami and me about our ""family curse"" when we were little girls? Well, I did some research and... she was *right*. I visited the graveyard and browsed the family history: every female seems to have died at the same age: 29 years and four days. Mom was ran over at exactly this age, you know? And when Ami drowned last year she was that old too. It continues like that throughout our history: Murders, accidents, diseases. Apparently none died earlier and none later. Creepy, right?
To come straight to the point: You know that I'm a little superstitious. I turned 29 yesterday and met a soldier at the party who says he could smuggle me into a military bunker. I mean, where could it be safer? I promise I'll return in a few days, I just wanted to make sure that ""curse"" is nonsense.

I can see the future of the waiter who refills our drinks with a polite smile.  He’s going to find a parking ticket on his car when he leaves work, and then his wife is going to yell at him when he gets home.  I make a mental note to leave him an extra big tip.

I can see the future of the little girl at the table across from us.  Tomorrow is her birthday, and she’ll get a stuffed bear that she’ll become inseparable from.  It’s hard not to smile as I realize how happy she’ll be.  Whatever brief happiness I feel for the little girl disappears as I turn my attention back to my wife. 

“I may be late getting home tonight,” she says, taking a sip of water nervously, “So much extra work.”

I can see her future.  I know that when she leaves this diner, when she walks down the block and takes an inattentive step into the road, she’ll be run down by a young driver.  That stupid bag of hers will skitter across the road with a spray of blood on it; the driver screaming in shock at the sight of the body that has shattered his windshield.  At this moment, I can’t bring myself to even attempt to alter my wife’s unfortunate destiny, the pain of her betrayal is so great.

Not just ‘cause it’s creepy, not just ‘cause it’s dark;

There are twisty twined trees, there are weeds and neglect,

But worse than all that is the “mocking” effect.

As you walk the park paths, you’ll hear a faint echo –

Footfalls – your own? – in that dim and grim ghetto,

Coming closer and closer as if someone’s there...

You whirl and see no one, just fog on the air.

So you whistle – it whistles. You cough – and it coughs.

Then from murky mists a gray shadow breaks off.

It’s your height and your size and your very same shape,

And then it’s upon you, no time to escape!

You suck in cold air, and then – *poof* – it moves through you.

You laugh at yourself – a shadow can’t chew you!

But you turn and see someone who’s walking away,

This person – your double! – you glimpse with dismay.

They continue their strolling on down the park trail,

While you melt into mist, a fog of gray veil.

And that’s why I won’t go back to Mockingbird Park –

I like being you.

His mother is gone so it's just the two of us.  I asked him once what his imaginary friend looked like.  His answer made me a bit uncomfortable.

He said she has no hair or teeth.  Her eyes are white and she only speaks in whispers.  According to my son Fiona wears no clothes.  Her feet are split so they come to two giant toes with sharp black nails on the end.  Her nose is small on her face and her head is lumpy and misshapen.  My son says she's strong.  She can lift his whole bed up with one arm and apparently she is 9 feet tall.  The most unnerving part is the long hairless prehensile tail that she drags along the ground.

I'm writing this because a few minutes ago my son came to my office and told me Fiona wanted to meet me and that she is waiting for us in his room.  I told him I would meet him there, but when I got to the door, I heard another voice in there with him.  It was a woman whispering.

The deserted house was spooky in the daytime, but at night, it was truly nightmarish. It was obvious that no-one had lived there for years. The woodwork was rotting, the windows had been boarded up, and graffiti lined the walls. Summoning up the last of his courage, he began to walk up the steps and over to the door. He gave one last look back at the three boys who were waiting just outside the gate, then hesitantly he knocked on the door. Silence followed and Jake looked at his watch, counting down the 60 seconds until he could get away from this house. Suddenly, his heart sunk as the door creaked open.

""I'm so sorry mommy!"" He kept crying, over and over again. Finally, I asked him why he was sorry. He looked at me with his piercing blue eyes, and whispered raggedly ""He said if I let him eat you, then he won't eat me. I'm so sorry mommy."" 

Then he screamed. Not because he was scared, but to let It know where we were.

So here I am, poking around and making fun of people. There are countless offices here, and the building is old enough to be a little creepy when most of the hundred people, who work here, leave for home. So once in a while, when someone stays late, I sneak close, unseen, and have simple fun.

Like opening their door slowly. Or toying with fuses to make lights flicker. Setting the A/C to ice-cold and quickly resetting it back when they decide to go investigate. Shutting the lights completely in unexpected moment is fun. Or just throwing something off the shelf. Noises are funny too. I've learned to drag my foot like zombie. Or just tap on the long walls, closing in and then stopping a few feets away from them. Few times I even recited some latin phrases from a distance.

Yeah, they see me sometimes, but I learned to hide quickly, so they think it's just their eyes playing tricks on them. Anyway, it is fun seeing them packing and leaving in a rush, sometimes running to their cars, sometimes really scared, shouting about demons and stuff.

Where had you even heard it last? Oh, right, the guy who made your coffee had been whistling. Or was it in that new commercial? Well, it hardly mattered – the thing was everywhere. Radio stations strung together hour-long medleys, the internet was absolutely riddled with amateur versions, and buskers played it on street corners. You would have expected people to get tired of it, but no one did.

Now and then, though, someone would wonder about the tune’s origins. A reporter would interview a man who’d say he first heard it while being tested in a secret corporate lab, or a wild-eyed astronomer would claim it had arrived on a signal from space that told him “they” were coming soon. Just your typical tinfoil hat wearers; the original composers were undoubtedly off relaxing on whatever island they must have purchased.

But why worry? As the tune circled the globe, violence and murder decreased to practically nil. Wars faded away. Politicians began to work together. For the first time in history, humanity just clicked. Everything ran smoothly. It would have been amazing if anyone who studied it could remain focused, but the simple truth was, once that catchy little ditty came to mind – and guaranteed, it would – then your day went by faster and more productively while you were distracted from your troubles.

The video showed a dark room, being filmed in black and white, and five people suspended hanging upside down from the ceiling. They were dressed in tattered grey robes. All five of them seemed to be fine, occasionally moving and their body language showing no signs of distress. The only one with her face visible, an attractive Korean-looking woman, smiled contently as she gazed into the camera. In the bottom right hand corner of the screen, a simple red word was overlayed over the video: *Live*

I mulled over the reasons why such a website should exist - the woman looked happy, deriving some sort of disturbed pleasure from being in that situation. In fact, her smile grew into a grin over time, almost as if she knew that I was looking at her. It took me a few minutes to notice that there were no ropes tied around her legs.

Then in the dark, I hear a noise.  *Thump thump thump*  I can feel the bed shift as it sits down beside me.  Something brushes over my cheek, as soft as the wind, but rough like leathered skin and bone.  It wants to trick me.  It wants me to give in.  My eyes are closed tightly, so tightly, because I know that if I open them, I'll see it.  I can imagine its face; chalk white sharpened teeth grinning at me from a lip-less mouth.  Deadened eyes staring at me, waiting for me to stare back into the void.

For sixty years, I've closed my eyes tight.  Every single night.  I've never had a lover to share my bed, never a wife, for fear of loosening this creature on another.  For sixty years, ever since I was a child, I've kept my eyes closed tight.  I knew that if I opened them, I would invite it, whatever it was, to do its worst.

I loved watching all the flora and fauna comfortably under the sunlight. I wouldn't say I was bored of it exactly, but I did want to branch out a little. I decided to take a trip in the middle of the night. I only brought along a single head lamp which, in hindsight, was a terrible idea. I drove out to my usual spot and disembarked. It was a little more difficult to see than I had expected, but I was already here so I decided not to worry about it. 

At night, it was a whole different experience. My head lamp shimmered off of various reflective surfaces, giving the place an eerie blue glow. The animals here were different than during the day. Occasionally I would catch a glimpse of something I had never seen before. I was so absorbed that I lost track of time; over an hour had already passed. My head lamp had been growing dimmer, and it got to the point that I could barely see my outstretched hands. Just as I decided it was time to head back, something grabbed my foot.

It began dragging me far away. Farther than I had ever ventured before. Struggling against what ever it was yielded no result. It was strong, and it would not let go. The further it took me away from my vehicle, the colder I got. Then I herd a loud rumble, and a massive rock slide came down on my legs. It either killed the thing holding onto me, or it scared it off, but I was still trapped. The rocks were much too heavy to lift. As my head lamp finally ran out of battery and I became engulfed in complete darkness and silence, I began wondering which would come first. Would I get eaten by some unseen horror, or would my scuba tank run out of oxygen?

If people don’t reject us, and don’t even notice us integrated into their lives, it’s easier than ever getting people where they should go.

The reaction was inevitable, really.

You throw in a country ruled by a dictator on the verge of long-range nuclear weapons, and a country slowly leaking the glory it had built up in the second world war through holes of bankruptcy and corruption?

The results aren't great.

Of course, there was bargaining. But no-one in the government really took it seriously.

It was the worst example of communism and the worst example of capitalism. They're not exactly birds of a feather. One had to go, and both of them knew it.

That's why the U.S. launched the bomb.

It was a game of wastelands, Russian roulette with the world. Neither side could afford to make any mistakes. 

You can almost understand the physicist's dilemma. They had to create a bomb powerful enough that there was zero possibility of a counter attack, zero possibility of a nuclear winter over the Northern Hemisphere.

That's how they created it. If you can't destroy something with pure explosive force, how could you destroy it instantly otherwise? A bomb that blew open a hole in matter, an unstable black hole.

Of course there was testing. You still can't go anywhere near Area 43.

The delivery was simple. A passing plane simply dropped it on a more rural part of Korea. We lost the plane, half of South Korea, and most of the surrounding ocean. But not because the hole in space absorbed it all.

Turns out a hole in space isn't much different than a hole in the wall.

I took a look at the readouts in my helmet. The impact didn’t puncture the suit, but my distress beacon never activated and I only had six hours of air at most. No one would know I was missing for another week. With a heartrending deliberation, I calmly accepted that I would die out here. Instead of slowly asphyxiating, I decided to open my helmet and make my death quick. For the first time since the explosion, I tried moving my arms… and nothing happened.

Mitchell stood there trying to make sense of the situation.  Once he realized what was happening, the walls and ceiling started to char and crumble to the ground.

Only then - when it was certain your copy was alive and healthy, did it take you apart at the molecular level. The Copy would come out the other side, his last memory being the warm sensation of the machine doing its scan. But the Original experienced those 10 seconds after being scanned.

Most importantly of all, we've put in some air conditioning!"" Here, John gave out a great bit smile, and Anton couldn't help but let a corner of his mouth rise.

""Anyway,"" John said, ""pentagrams have been repurposed to allow transport back and forth between the mortal world and Hell -- you walk in, find a demon you like, and walk right out with it, all under twenty minutes. Of course, the days of employing these things to your benefit with no personal cost are over; the Crown is going to tax you on it, like everything else. Now, come on; I'm on the clock."" Anton hesitated for a moment, and stepped in. ""Nothing's happening,"" he said. ""I would argue that plenty is happening,"" said Beels.

There were many, *many* strange entries in that journal, but this one in particular strummed a primal, grating chord of fear in my heart, and I won't ever forget it. It was dated January 19th, 1927, and it read:

""I recently attended what could only be described as a wake-in-waiting for an elderly gent with whom I have had a passing acquaintance for some years now. I was invited to his summer estate by telegram, under pretense that a number of people in his circle of friends were to come and enjoy a week-long retreat of bonfires, boating and good cheer. Instead, we were treated to the horror of an old man in the last stages of a wasting disease: a hollow-eyed, skeletal madman, ranting that his young wife was, in fact, the familiar of a demon to which he had sold his soul many years before. We were there, he informed us, to make sure that she didn't perpetrate any violence to his person, with the intent of speeding his death.

""His pretty young wife was Asiatic in appearance and could speak not a single word of English. She gazed sorrowfully down from her husband's bedside the whole five days that it took for him to die. The old man begged his guests to take turns at a twenty-four-hour watch, and, not knowing what else to do, we obliged him. It was during my watch when he began to rattle his last few breaths, and I called to the others to rouse themselves from sleep and join me. Our host's eyes were wild with fear; he clawed feebly at the doctor's sleeves as he died, clutching at them, as if to hold on and not be dragged away ... unmoving, his wife watched it all. We all bowed our heads in silence to his demise - except for a maid, who was present in the room and blind since birth. The maid stared with milky eyes at the new widow beside the bed and began to scream, *""She's eating him! She's eating him! Dear God, she's eating him!'""*"	t5_2t6kz	True

He or she will usually inaudibly scream or cry, and begin gesticulating wildly. You know. Ghost shit. The audience always asks me what this poor soul is saying.

My reply depends heavily on how brisk business has been lately. If things are going well, I will always tell them that the spirits want them to clean up their act. Pray more. Give more to the needy.

Above them, it wasn't long before tortured screams had started to echo on the streets, as their neighbors were systematically hunted, torn to ropes of tissue and re-assembled; they lived anew as homicidal piles of raw, glistening meat and sharpened bone. To drown out this horrific cacophony, the man and his wife clung to each other on the cot and made quiet, desperate love, again and again ... they did so to re-affirm their bond, their lives, their very existence. They did it in defiance of their eventual demise; to be stuck in a frozen moment of heaven, while Hell was unleashed above.

Like a young man smitten, the husband rediscovered his wife's form with grasping hands and sucking mouth, and she writhed beneath his frenzy. She took her man inside her in every way that she'd ever denied him before. They fucked and gyrated and strained against each other in rivers of sweat; in the real world, human civilization toppled and died. Days melded into nights - fires raged above, and lust reigned below. They fucked; they ate; they slept. They lost themselves in a sweet dream of friction and heat.

The man and his wife were startled awake by the sound of a hole being drilled into the living room wall above them. The swarming abominations had finally been alerted to their presence, and the dream was over. The man kissed the upper swell of his wife's left breast, tenderly, then pressed the barrel of the pistol there and pulled the trigger. Blood sprayed from her back and spattered upon the dull cement wall behind her. She grasped her husband's hand as she slumped, and he wept into her failing eyes as he shot himself in the temple.

My eyes adjusted to the light and I noticed two smaller rashes on my chest as well. These were round right above my ribs, no wait, these were bruises. Small round bruises, equally spaced. “That’s odd.” I thought to myself.  I looked closer at the rash around my throat. Again, not a rash at all, it seemed to be a bruise across my adam's apple.

Living or dead, doesn’t matter, although it’s usually quicker to go with the latter.

Good thing I work in a hospital.  For months, I’d collected my offerings.  A few “misplaced” blood samples here, some pre-op hair clippings there.

""What if,"" I said, ""your eyes started to glow right now because you're really aliens!?"" They laughed at that one.

When we exited the tunnel, the train lurched and that's when I started screaming, and then we all did. We were so focused on the imaginary horrors we'd been making up, none of us had considered a possible reality. None of us had said, ""What if the bridge is out?""

This usually works very well, through the countless small miracles of shared experience that keep us all grounded in the same reality. It's why so few of us choose to live alone. Deep down, we know that some things in this world don't become real until they're seen. And when another set of eyes is around, it's not so tempting to look for yourself.

When you come home and something's out of place, you can chalk it up to a messy roommate or a careless spouse or a mischievous pet. And that's exactly what you do. That way you don't have to look for something else. Something that can touch your belongings from where it waits, but can't get all the way in until it is seen. Something curious and lonely.

I saw 34.jpg sitting next to the first picture, and in this one the lady was starting to stand up. The link seemed obviously malicious so I closed it and started running a virus scan to clear out any presents it left me. As the scan finished and I was getting ready for bed, 33.jpg showed up on my desktop. I could more clearly see the woman's face as she was closer. The lighting really sucked because her eyes were just pure black.

I turned off my computer and decided to deal with whatever weird software was on my computer in the morning. When I got up the next day, my desktop was covered in images, about 30 or so. In each one she got closer to the camera and I saw a sideways grin on her face get wider, manic even. In 11.jpg she started reaching with her hand, which looked horridly mangled, broken at almost every joint. In the most recent image, 3.jpg, the woman was nowhere to be seen. I decided to go back to the source to see if I could find what this program was, so I went back to the original link. Instead of a black page I saw a very dimly lit picture of my room with that lady sitting on my bed."	t5_2t6kz	True

He was still dressed in his hospital clothes, his paper mask hanging loosely around his neck.


She wept, but he tried not to as he walked to the cradle in their room. There, swaddled in a pink blanket was his own new baby daughter, eyes closed and unmoving; a grey tint to her skin which was now cool to the touch. Dr.Clawson lifted her out so gently, so lovingly, and walked over to the bed to give Mrs. Clawson her baby.


As she took the baby in her arms, and the tears flowed from her eyes, she cradled her tenderly. “Come back to me, baby. Come back to me, baby.” Dr. Clawson could no longer hold back his own tears.


“Two souls for one."" Dr. Clawson said sternly to the black shadow thing with the dull red eyes that was standing in the corner of the bedroom. His voice once again trembled,“You promised.”


There was a shift of it’s eyes, then a long, raspy sigh, “So we will wait until morning.”"	t5_2t6kz	True

""Are you feeling good, mister Tieman?""
I wasn't sure if it was the sedative or his surgical mask that made him sound muffled, but I nodded and made a verbal noise that apparantly came close enough to ""Yeah"".
""Excellent, let's get started then. Dr. Verhoven."" The anesthesist ruffled around for a little bit where I couldn't see him, then placed that familiar mask over my mouth and nose. This wasn't the usual stuff they made me breathe, though. I got a good look at his round, friendly face when he hovered over me and said: ""Allright mister Tieman, I'd like you to start counting down from 100."" When he said '100' I'd already started hearing echoes to his voice, so this probably wouldn't take long. Just a few more seconds of counting down, then I'd finally be done with all this. I'll finally be able to get on with my life.

The surgeon adressed his assistants.

Then the elves escorting him cackled, and he found himself inside the house. He ignored the Christmas tree and crept into the girl’s room. Gently, he shook her awake. “Hello, Emmaline,” he smiled. “You’re the last child on my list tonight. That makes you very special.”

Her sleepy eyes widened. “M-me?” He nodded. “Every child is special, Emma, but this year you have the most hope. Nobody knows this, but each Christmas I invite the most hopeful child on earth to come to the North Pole, and next year they help the elves fill my bag so I can bring happiness to all the world. Would you like to help? I’ll do my best to see that you have a wonderful year!”

Yes, oh yes, of course she said yes! They always did. It never got any easier, but the elves... Well, it would be worse if the elves did not get what they wanted. Worse for everyone. But each year, the thing that made Santa’s burden possible – the magic bag – frayed and wore down, so the elves had to repair its holes. How do you patch a magic sack that never fills up? The elves used the one thing that can stretch almost forever – hope. And for that, they needed just the right kind of fresh leather. "	t5_2t6kz	True

It was almost the end of the world. Sheets and sheets of rain, fierce winds, and truly apocalyptic lightning. Millions of people died, and the devastation was terrible. The meteorologists scrambled to pull explanations out of their butts, while the preachers had their butts already covered. Really though, no one but Melinda Keeney, of 238 N. Henderson Avenue, knew what the problem was.

“It’s all my fault, Mommy,” Melinda said to her mother as they trembled in their tub. Outside, tornadoes were prowling and growling close by.

“Hush, now. Why on earth would all this be your fault?”

“Because of what I said yesterday, to a cloud. I was the last one. I felt it.”

Mom kept crying, which I thought was a little overdramatic, but that's mom for you. The neighbors are all pretty quiet, for the most part. It can get a little noisy when they have friends over, but the visits never last too long and it doesn't happen very often.

For the first couple months my parents kept dropping by unannounced, which was kind of annoying. I mean damn, what if I had a girl over? Heh, yeah right. My girlfriend was there to help me move in, and that was it. I think she moved on. Anyway, it's not so bad here. Kinda cramped, but what're ya gonna do?

He'd had drug problems in the past, and struggled with depression, but none of knew how bad it had gotten. No one saw the warning signs. Maybe we would have suspected something if we'd seen his art...
 
His computer was full of digital photographs; shots he'd taken of the old hospital, the woods around town, his house. They weren't great, as far as landscapes go. But then he'd taken them and photoshopped in these... creatures. They looked something like satyrs and minotaurs, but corrupt. Some were covered with infected sores running with puss; some were emaciated, with broken horns and dessicated skin. Some had insectoid or arachnid features, like compound eyes, and exoskeletons; many had such traits in combination. They're drawn in a style reminiscent of Brom, but the realism of the images rivals anything Giger's ever done with an airbrush. They show how much talent and potential Jeremy had; they also show how dark a place he was in. I miss the guy, and I prayed for him.

A week ago, his brother sent me a box of Jeremy's possessions that they'd found clearing out his storage unit. Inside was an envelope of some of his old work, pictures of the same creatures lurking around town. Unlike his later work, the shots were always from a distance, and the creatures were never shown very clearly; yet I found these photos more disturbing, for some reason. than any of the ones on his hard drive.

1357041475.0	15rpmj	You Always Loved My Sense of Humor	marmaladeskies9	125	15	4	"In its most basic form, horror is quite similar to comedy. The most effective jokes are those that set up an expectation and then defeat it. Take the following example:

Two goldfish are in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing anyway?”

The joke is humorous because you assume from the first sentence that the story takes place in a goldfish tank. The second sentence upsets this belief and prompts you to laugh at yourself. The essence of horror is also the reversal of expectations. In horror, the puppet manipulates its master, the inanimate object becomes animated, and your reflection keeps smiling even after you begin to scream. Horror shakes your most basic assumptions about how the world works. If properly executed, it can make you fear the most commonplace things, even things you used to love.

Here’s an example that you might relate to better: Say you rush to turn off the Sinatra song that used to be your favorite, only to find your radio has been unplugged the entire time.

Say you hear footsteps and whistling in the front hall, and you smile before remembering you live alone now.

Say you lock the door to your study and stuff rags in the crack to keep out the penetrating cold, but the door still swings open of its own accord.

She was a beautiful girl with one quirk, which was her love for things most folks consider unsightly – dead roses, rotting trees, old bones and such. Her father had declared her off-limits to his workmen, so she took comfort instead from all things sad and lonely, like herself. Now, in those northern woods there lives a creature of legend with a funny name: the squonk. Some say squonks are animals, some say they are part human, but all agree they’re the ugliest beasts that ever lived. So ugly, they weep all the time! Although monstrous, none have ever been captured, for once seen squonks will dissolve completely in a sudden gush of shame-filled tears.

Well, this girl fell in love with one. Every night she’d slip out to the dark forest, where the pair would listen to each other's sorrows. United by sadness, they made plans to wed and run away, but the squonk had one proviso – that she should never look directly upon him. She reluctantly agreed, and their secret wedding night arrived. Atop a high hill beneath the moon, she closed her eyes and lay back as the squonk took her into his hideous arms and kissed her, deeply and passionately. Come morning, however, the poor girl’s lifeless body was found in that same spot. Her story was sifted from her diary, but her death took some deduction. Eventually it was decided she had yielded to temptation and tried to sneak a look at her lover during their first and only kiss. Perhaps she screamed at the sight of him, perhaps not.

Either way, a high hill was a very strange place to drown."	t5_2t6kz	True

The scent of the wind. The red glow of the horizon.

They claimed the enemy would not hesitate to use nuclear bombs, and to have a shelter ready, but I saw no such need. The US would not bother using such force, for many reasons.

I was hoping I could just chill inside, but the light kept going out for some unknown reason, so I spent the night running back and forth between the house and the lighthouse. After getting a few hours of restless sleep, I woke up in the afternoon to find that the storm had died down.

 Looking out my window, I saw to my great surprise that I had a visitor. A man in a grey overall was standing at the beach, seemingly unfazed by the northern wind blowing in behind him. In fact, he was completely motionless, looking up towards the house. I was about to go greet him, when by blind luck I remembered my kettle of water on the stove. Turning it off, I happened to glance out the kitchen window. Another man had joined the first one, this one wearing a blue overall. He looked like a ship engineer. They both stood silent, slack jawed, staring. The waves washing over their feet didn't seem to bother them. No boat was on the beach. I looked closer. It wasn't before now I noticed their soaked garments, their shriveled hands, their blue, bloated faces. Another head broke the waves.

They come from the sea.

The best part about my gift, because I truly would call it a gift, is that I can see the good, the purpose, in everyone.  Even in those who might not see it in themselves.  

My most recent example was a homeless man I saw sitting at the street corner, a worn cardboard sign in his hands, begging for food.  This was about four months ago.  I, being the wonderful human being that I am, drove home and cooked this man a delicious meal with what meat I hadn’t donated to the local food bank.  When I brought it to him, he was ever so grateful, and we struck up a fast friendship.  Weeks went by, as I brought him more food, gave him money, gave him new clothes; even helped him apply for a job.  I worked so hard to put him in a better place, to allow him to contribute to humanity, that it was quite distressing to see him still sitting on that street corner in tattered clothes with that same worn sign after four months.  

Tonight, I invited him back to my home, determined to give him another chance.  I can still see the purpose in him, despite his best efforts to fail.  Everyone has a purpose, and his is just as clear as the last misguided soul I’d tried to help.

If you shoot or stab someone, you make the decision to kill them once and it's done. The wound does most of the killing, you just put it there.

You can't just strangle someone for an instant and leave your work behind. You wrap your hands around their throat and you begin... their struggles or protestations reach you, you comprehend them.

But every moment you continue is another decision. At any second you could release and leave them alive.

To choke someone, you couldn't decide just once... you decided again, every second, to kill her. You saw the terror in her eyes, felt her hands clawing at your arms, your button-down shirt, heard her thoughts of ""why, why, stop, please,"" and yet - you didn't relent.

But AVG was a little too good at its job. As the bacterium accidentally, and yet inevitably, spread out from plastic reduction centers to the outside world, it quickly became known as the “new rust.” Plastic toys purchased for Christmas would have quarter-sized holes in them before Easter. Car interiors were reduced to dust in months. Medical instruments, computers, toothbrushes, cell-phones, buttons, shopping bags, you name it, it was all dissolving into what looked like gray powder. The irony was people were now consuming at an even more furious rate than before, because what you bought last week would be unusable in three weeks. Glass, wood and various metals rebounded as production materials, but it turns out that it is really hard to substitute for everything plastic did. Hospitals, transportation, the internet, everything started to crash. Something had to be done. That’s why they made AVG-231, a mutation designed to reprogram 230 into something inert or at least slower acting.

The two of them continued to wait in silence, until Penelope Watson finished her appointment and returned. She paid her bill and then, like it was an afterthought, held out a hand to her daughter and snapped her fingers.

The orphanage told me that my biological parents had passed away in an accident when I was two, so I don’t have any memory of them. I can’t even remember their faces. When I was seven, two beautiful souls adopted me. Jenna and Adam Parker, the people I would learn to call mom and dad. Mom always told me how much she loved me and how she wanted only the best for me. Dad always said that he wanted me to become a gentleman and treat others with the utmost respect. My *other* mother, however, said different things.


My *other* mother only appeared at night, telling me about the cruelties and monstrosities that the world held. She wanted me to purge the world of all its impurities and burn everything that would stand in my way. I had always been afraid of my *other* mother, but I didn’t dare tell mom and dad. My *other* mother would break things while she was giving her devilish sermons, and my parents would blame me when they found out, though they always forgave me right away.


It wasn’t until I was fifteen when my *other* mother vanished. She told me one night that she was going to take mom away from me and then she just stopped coming. That night, mom took her own life. It was during the funeral that I overheard one of my aunts. “Dissociative identity disorder, she gave up”, one of them said.

Things like “what to wear?” or “do I have a bagel or fruit for breakfast.” My choice is a little different. Being a father and a husband, I must choose who I want to be with. Every morning I wake up I roll over to find I am sleeping alone. My wife always was an early riser.  So when I leave the bedroom into the hallway I have to decide to either take a peek in my beautiful daughter’s room or go straight to the kitchen for a cup of my wife’s favorite morning brew. We Catholics can always find a path to guilt. 

For me, it is always an impossible choice to make. I want to be with them both constantly, together, but to choose one means I must neglect the other. It kills me inside because I love and need them both for me to breathe, nevertheless function. But every morning I make the choice to open my angel’s bedroom and look in the toddler bed she slept peacefully in. I take in the sight of her toys on the floor still spread out from the most recent time she played with them. There are fewer pleasures greater than watching your little one create imaginary worlds in front of you and welcome you into it by handing you a plastic fork turned thermometer turned airplane. 

When I’m done my quiet morning daydream, I enter the kitchen that my wife insisted I remodel. There, I brew myself a cup and stare at the new backsplash and sink my wife once picked out that I had recently installed. I only wish she had seen it before she left me alone. But then I never would have changed the stained wallpaper or the saturated sink she rested against when I last saw her had she not made her choice to go. I could never be upset with her for leaving me. She too had an impossible choice; to live with the sorrow of missing our perfect little angel or to attempt to join her in eternity as soon as she could. At least she could make that choice. We Catholics cannot. So each morning I have to make an impossible choice: is this the day I end my sorrow and return to the arms of my loving wife or do I wait through this unbearable pain and suffering with hopes of one day joining my daughter?

Especially when they sleep, so peaceful, those kind eyes rest beneath that soft, thin bit of  skin, so perfect.

I love watching their eyes wiggle around under the skin, that's when i know they are dreaming.

I wonder what they dream of...

Is it me? no... if only.




My lover hasn't seen me.. yet. 

The timing just hasn't been right, i know we are perfect for each other, from all the things ive seen and heard them do, they are just like me!

i love hearing the pitter patter of their typing, or the short, quick puffs of air they release through their nose when they find something amusing

It's so cute.

Actually no noise. I'm a bit worried, what if they had a stroke or something?

That stuff happens all the time, and out of nowhere, right?




I better check on them, its the right thing to do.

I used to own a beautiful Mercedes, I used to work hard for her, but still, she forgot I cared. She moved away, married again, had 2 more kids, and got an OK job in an office. Apparently, my once best friend got it for her. Guess he forgot about me too.

The guy she married, he seems OK. He's not the brightest, but he's gentle, and kind, and everything I was to her. I sometimes wonder if she thinks about me when she looks at him, but I've never caught her at it. Believe me, if she'd brought me up, I'd know.

I keep a pretty close eye on her.

I wish I could watch her dream. I can see her sleeping, but I wonder what goes on in her mind while she dozes. One thing that's always disappointed me is that I've never seen her scream. She's never woken up in the dead of night, drenched in a cold sweat. No matter how hard I try, she sleeps like a baby. 

Nobodies conscience is that clean.

Sometimes I wonder if I was wrong. Sometimes, I think that maybe she isn't responsible, and that there may have been more to those last days. Smoking, drinking and occasionally cocaine were all parts of my life, but I just don't see why it would have gone the way it did. No marriage should end that way.

I didn’t buy this machine so I could sit at the playground and watch the sunlight streak highlights into the rich, deep timber colored hair of my former childhood self. Nor did I buy it to revisit the days when my smile, as white as snow, would sparkle and dance alongside my bright green eyes every time I ran into my fathers arms. I don’t want to meet myself and show my childhood the upcoming yellow stained teeth, the dirt caked under my fat rolls, the balding head, the spurts of pink lesions caking my body. I only bought this machine to see my father again. The loving, caring, cradling father that held me so close when the night was darkest. The father that would toss me in the air, then catch me just before my feeble body collided with the hard, concrete floor. The father that would have protected me from what I’ve now become. I remember very little of the time I spent with my him, but I remember that he was the only one who ever cared, the only person in whose arms I was fully secure, whose embrace always calmed my chattering teeth and quivering toes.  It pained me deeply when he disappeared. I remember waking one dark night to the sound of thuds, grunts, and piercing screams. There was a struggle, a clutter and clang of toppling furniture, a vicious and horrifying shriek. My small hands draped the blanket over my tiny body and I called out my fathers name as loud as my frail vocal chords allowed. He did not respond. He was gone. I never heard from him again.

That’s all I want to see. I just want to know what happened that night. Tonight. That’s why I’m here, hiding in the closet, watching that child dream. I won’t make myself known. If I need to, I can always press the panic button and be hurled back to my present time. My obese, faltering body is making it difficult to sit here without stirring, but I won't make a sound. I can see the blanket rise and recede in rhythmic breathing. I can hear my father’s footsteps right outside the door. He slowly opens and strolls in. There he is, standing tall, just as handsome as I remember. A white sleeveless tank top tightly hugs his body, he walks with the confidence that always assured me that he was in control, that he would protect me. I’m nervous. My atrophied muscles are tensing and sweat droplets are collecting on my upper lip. This is when it happened. This is when it will occur, and the small child will wake up and fasten a tight grip onto the blanket, screaming my father’s name directly into the darkness.

My father is approaching my former self now. He is whispering something into my ear as he gently tousles my hair. So much love he had for me. My eyes are watering. His long fingers stroke my face and I mimic his caress on to my now aged, decaying face. My childhood continues to sleep. My father leans in and kisses me on the forehead. Ok, any moment now. My hand is tight on the panic button, my heart is racing, I have not blinked. My father kisses me again. Soon. What happens here? What is my father doing? Wait…What is he doing?? WHAT IS HE DOING?!

WHAT IS HE DOING TO ME?!

Sure, there was pain then, too: the first time you scraped your knee, the horrible, sickening snap of your fledgling arm bones trying to catch yourself falling off your bike, the first time you had your heart broken -- all of that was nothing compared to this. This horrible, gnawing pain, clawing at your innards. Your brain alive with a constant cacophony, as if swarming with thousands of incessant hornets, driving you further to madness. Despite this, despite the deep, unceasing throbs wracking your body with blinding pain, you cannot stop. Your body will not let you. You continue to search, to fiend for one further moment, however brief, to free yourself of this deep hurt. 

Your legs unrelentlessly press onward, the asphault cuts into your bare feet -- ripping open blisters and sores with every shambling step, leaving horrible streaks of blood and pus in their wake. Everyone is gone now. These streets are quiet, filled with the dead: bloated, fly-ridden corpses sizzle against the hot ground, decaying into sludge. You hardly even notice the smell anymore. Your feet, the putrid odor of the dead, none of that matters now. There is only your pain, driving you onward for one last moment of relief. 

Agonizing hours pass before you finally hear another. A whimper in an alley stops you short, your horribly blood-shot eyes widen at the hope for one more moment, one *last* moment... She's alone, a bandage wrapped around her arm is doing little to stop massive bleeding. No doubt she has been bitten and left to die, like so many before her. Her screams pierce the stagnant air as her eyes set upon you, but it is far too late. Like a trapped animal she tries hopelessly to escape, but you are too fast for her, too strong. Your jagged, broken teeth sink deeply into her sweet, living flesh, ripping and tearing through veins and muscle, feeding your undying hunger. She is quiet now, only the faint gurgles of her last, fleeting breath struggling through the blood that fills her throat, as she feebly grasps at the red, slippery, mess that is the strewn remnants of her organs, spread across her lap. The last human parts of you long to be like her -- to die, to be free of this horror. But the pain pushes your horrible, rotting corpse onward. Pain is all there is now.

What if you had a child with a genetic mutation? What would you say then?” The concerned look on his face was no longer practiced but sincere and somewhat agitated. “What makes you think I don’t know what you’re talking about?” he asked. “Ten years ago I had a daughter born prematurely with a genetic mutation producing one of the most awful phenotypic expressions I have ever seen. ” “In that case,” I said, sensing the upper hand, “what do you have to say about your daughter?” He paused significantly, then said, “She’s sitting in the jar to your left.”

Daily beatings. Routine torture. Starvation. Dehydration. Physical, mental, emotional abuse. And everyone there knew there was no hope for rescue. The old military had long since been crushed, and the old government dissolved. Rumor had it that the Regime had since moved on to other countries, and I was inclined to believe it.

The one saving grace about that place was the lottery. For some unknown reason-probably just for their own sick amusement-Every month, the authorities there entered every prisoner into a lottery, the winner of which was released from the facility and its constant torture. It was certainly a sight watching a crowd of thousands crying, shouting incomprehensibly, and praying to any number of deities, and riots often formed around the person with the winning number. I had heard that one time, somebody even tried to tear off the winner's arm in a misguided attempt to claim the number as their own. You could imagine the strange combination of numbness, elation, and utter fear I had the day my number was called.

Luckily, I was by the front of the crowd, near some guards that day, and I suppose the authorities didn't want any of their own endangered, as they intervened to bring me on stage more quickly than usual. I sat surrounded by armed guards as the warden gave some speech about this wonderful monthly gift and the Regime's great mercy that I only half-listened to. I was in a daze, the crowd and the speech barely more than a dull roar, as I felt joy flow into me, an emotion I didn't know even existed inside me anymore. I was finally free.

Robert Blackburn had been a nice man who would turn his large house into a timeshare during the summer months while he went traveling. Except he rarely actually went anywhere, and he wasn’t actually nice. Many times he had hidden in his basement, then emerged at night to torture his guests to death. Blackburn had disappeared before his trial many years ago, but local legend said his spirit would still come for anyone foolish enough to spend the night. Jeremy and Warren had a good time spooking themselves there, just like the old days. In an ancient cupboard, they even found a stack of moldy cards which asked guests to rate their stay, and they dutifully filled them in: “13 out of 10 stars! Enjoyed not being murdered!” Daring each other, they slept in Blackburn’s dank, earthy basement beneath the rotting floorboards, where the killer had hidden himself so often.

When Jeremy arrived back home at dawn, one of the rating cards slipped from his pack onto the foyer floor. Or so he thought. When he stooped to pick it up, he saw handwriting he didn’t recognize. Next to “What did you enjoy most about our timeshare?” was scrawled one word: “Kate.” There was no answer to his yells as he ran upstairs as fast as he could."	t5_2t6kz	True

For ten minutes or so, He would look between the curtains and observe the life that played across the stage. The people all played the same parts every morning, going about their routines and movements across the street without so much as a glance towards His window, but He didn’t mind - they were the only part of the day that made Him feel like He was still a moving part of the world.

The only movement He had left was in His eyes, His neck, and His face. He couldn’t even breathe on His own – His Autovent 4000 took care of that for Him. 

So, it was on a morning of no particular significance that a weak light tickled His face, and He opened His eyes, turned His neck, and looked out the window to a strange world. It was utterly silent – no chirping, no rustling. No footsteps or bike chains. He blinked, and strained to listen. Nothing. Then, He realized that the whole of His world was still.

Outside, the world was absolutely immobile. He looked out, furrowing His eyebrows, thinking that He was missing something. Nothing. He looked for the requisite 10 minutes or so, and then turned His head towards the door. He waited. Nothing. Laurie never barged through the door.

That's why, when I realized my daughter never said her first words, I kept her in captivity, practicing music everyday. It would be far too depressing to find out that a mother lost her only child, so I made sure she never spoke. 

I kept her in the basement, having her practice the violin for six hours a day. She started when she was five. That was 15 years ago. Her playing skills improved so much in the first few years, I thought about sending her off to an institution for gifted musicians. Then I realized, no one knew I had a daughter and if they asked her, she may just sing. So, I kept her there in the basement where she was safe and could perfect her act. She would listen to old orchestral movements, study lines of music theory, practice until her fingers would bleed and the bow would snap. She was my little muse; I would have her play as I practiced my ballet steps from when I was her age.

I will never forget the first time she saw the light of day. I was drinking a morning cup of coffee at the kitchen table when I noticed the basement door was ajar. I spilled the coffee all over my lap and bolted for the front door, knocking over my chair and a bookcase in the process. There she was, my beautiful daughter, arms open and spinning on the front lawn, singing a song for the angels. *Forevermore shall you be singing for the angels. The time is now,* my thoughts confirmed. So, I grabbed her by the neck and dragged her back inside. Wringing my hands around her vocal chords, I heard her choke and a weak *snap!* of her neck left her limp in my arms. I shed a tear; her voice was so beautiful!

Summary of Findings:

Doctor Joseph Rankle was a top neurosurgeon who had his license revoked for unethical practices. Patient files suggest sadism, though that was only the beginning. He was subsequently hired by an unknown international organization that specialized in information extraction through torture. Dr. Rankle had successfully performed head transplants on humans in secret trials, the procedures of which are fully documented in his private notes. Standard information extraction procedures (SIEP) as developed by Dr. Rankle involved full torture of the victim’s body excluding the head of the victim. Upon exhaustion, Dr. Rankle would then transplant the victim’s head onto a living and healthy body, successfully attaching all nerves and muscle function to the point of the victim regaining full mobility and sensation. Torture was resumed until either the desired information was acquired or the new body was exhausted. If the latter, SIEP would then dictate a second healthy body for transplant and so on. In over one hundred and ten SIEP victims, private files show a one hundred percent success rate in obtaining information with no victim holding out for more than four transplants. 

Recommendations:

The innovative SIEP reliably secures any and all desired information from human subjects. As such, this procedure and along with it Dr. Joseph Rankle, should be considered a highly prized asset for the government and its defense. This panel recommends Dr. Joseph Rankle be given a new identity, full access to top secret government funded laboratories to operate, and a position to train other approved neurosurgeons on SIEP."	t5_2t6kz	True

I burst through the front door with a cheesy ""Honey, I'm hooome!"" The house was silent, but there was a slip of paper on the stairs leading up to our bedroom. I picked it up and grinned - it was a homemade coupon she had written for me: ""One free kiss."" I bound up the stairs, eager to collect, when I noticed another coupon taped to the banister: ""One free [censored sexual act]."" Now, of course, I was grinning even wider.

1361218490.0	18rq8x	Player-Piano	mucalling	84	12	14	"It was a pretty dumb forum, really. I used to go on there pretty much every night, when it was late, just to scare myself watching black-and-white Russian videos and contemplating gory photoshopped pictures. And, of course, declaring to the other users that their videos weren't scary and that I could photoshop gore better than them without touching a computer. It was a bit strange, in hindsight, that the website let you share files for download but not post links.

The last video I watched, was different from the others. I downloaded it onto my desktop, and started watching - the video struck me as unique immediately. Crystal clear, it showed a little girl in a white dress sitting on a stool and bent in concentration over a piano. The video was shot from behind her, and had no sound, but it was clear that she was practising something, repeating the same pattern over and over again. All of a sudden, the girl's body tensed, and she made as if to turn around. Not wanting another jump scare, I closed the media player and went to sleep.

Since then, my mind keeps returning to what I saw, going through it over and over again. My computer, when I turned it on the following morning, was stuck on the media player, with the girl bent over the piano. For some reason, not seeing the girl's face is making me more and more tense each day - as is the thought that she is always there, playing that sequence of notes, over and over, waiting. I don't go into my bedroom anymore, and when I do, I give my back to the monitor. I'm afraid that if I turn around, she will too.

Thank goodness I have my family around to entertain me. I love being around them. My Dad is my best friend and we used to have the best time together before I started to get sick. Mom, she always knows how to make me feel loved and taken care of regardless of how her day goes. Of course, my brother and sister both keep me happy with their constant games and affection. I just wish I could give all that joy back to each of them like the good ole days.

At least they are with me now. Everyone is pretty quiet though and I do not know where we are going but at least we are taking a car ride. I used to love these rides…ugh, the pain...it never goes away anymore. It doesn't matter what my parents feed me, nothing makes me feel any better.  They just cuddle and coddle me now. I love it when they do, it brings me as much comfort as I can find these days. And now I see why everyone is so quiet, we are back at the doc’s office…or at least that’s what my big sister calls it. Not too fond of this place, ever since I was a small thing I can remember dreading this place. That feeling hasn’t changed either, not in my 14 years and it probably never will. At least my siblings and Mom are hugging me tight, even through the pain I still find joy in it. I kiss each of them, thanking them, while catching the salty water on their face as they pull me close. 

It’s just me, Dad and Doc now in this dark and dreary room. Mom said she couldn’t come in so Dad is standing in front of me while I lay belly to table. His face is so close to me, staring me in my eyes and brushing back my hair. I know he loves me with everything in his heart and I know he knows I love him more. Not even a small bite on my back can keep me from relishing this loving moment with my Dad. Wish we can sit like this forever but I am getting too sleepy to keep eye contact. That car ride must have worn me out. Thankfully, Dad is still close but he looks to be in great pain too. I’ll give him one more loving lick, a thanks, to make him feel better before I rest.

I assured them each I would be first thrown into the water, and as promised a rapid dubbed ""Tombstone"" had launched me clear overboard and into the deep end. Hitting the cold water shocked my system, which probably explains a little why I didn't bob to the surface sooner. That, and I saw something entirely peculiar.

Down beneath the roaring current, tucked safely under a sheltering rock, was a creature most odd. It had blinking pale eyes, humanoid yet small as a dog. Its feet molded to a fin, silver green scales traveling up it's body to leave a fleshy face and expanding gills. I puzzled at it as it smiled at me, noticing (a bit late) that where arms may have been were instead thousands of silver strings, elastic and thin as hairs. I should have swam back up, but instead I met it's touch as it reached out to me.

The strings found my pores immediately, burrowing into my flesh with excruciating agony. I tried to scream and more filled my mouth, my nose, my ear, the sockets of my eyes. It pushed into my body, wriggling inside me, it's own body pressed to mine, burning hot, dissolving onto my flesh. When I felt it no more I pushed myself to the surface, gasping for breathe. I felt my toes and fingers stretch, my teeth gnash, my tongue poke around inside my cheeks. My body obeying commands I had not given. My arms moved, my feet kicking to tread water, motions I hadn't thought of.

But it was only when I was ten years old when one of these things stood out from the rest. *She* looks human, except for her unnervingly long nails and her sharp, protruding horns. Though she looks like a demon, she has always been an angel to me. She talks to me and tells me that she will always be there to protect me; that everything will be alright. And whenever I hear the sound of the bells that she wears around her wrist, I felt safe.

It was when I was in tenth grade when I started getting bullied. It wasn’t unexpected since I had such a small build for a kid my age. It was so bad that I got used to crying myself to sleep at night. What I hated most was that I never heard her bell while I was bullied. It was as if she abandoned me. One night while I was crying, however, I heard her bell. There she was, standing in the corner of my room, holding a human finger in her hands. She told me that she will protect me and that she was sorry for being gone for so long.

The kids who bullied me disappeared one after another. The police never found them, even after weeks and months of searching. It’s been fifteen years since then and I have a comfortable job now. It is so easy to excel and get raises in my workplace as anybody who tried to compete with me usually disappears without a trace. And whenever someone disappears, I will have one more finger to add to my collection.

I'm in torment ... I thirst. I'm cold, *so* cold; my body is one with the clammy, frigid floor of the basement that I hide in. It's dark down here, but I can see the spiders and rats that I hunt just fine. I don't need light to see. I don't need it to live, not like you do. Do you miss me still? Do you wonder about what became of me anymore?

I hate this night, more than every wretched night of my existence. I follow you sometimes, on the occasions when you go out after sunset with your husband and children; I watch as you walk and laugh with them, with *him*, and even though I want to scream my despair to the stars I don't. I smile instead. Because I love you, and I always will. Every night, when my eyes spring open and I realize, once again, that my dreams of you were nothing but lies that loneliness told me - every night I'm glad that the bastard took me, and not you. I was trailing behind you at the fair when it snatched me. You never even suspected what really happened ... and I'm so fucking glad that you didn't, because it could have easily been you that got carried off that night, so many years ago. You should never know this horror, what it's like to be dead and cold and so *thirsty*, so *alone*. No, my love, not you. Not ever.

That's why I'm going to go outside at sunrise. I want to see the sun again. I have to do this -  if I don't, I won't be able to fight the raging temptation anymore. I can't spend another Valentine's Day without you. Seeing you last year really hurt, more than it ever has. I punched holes in the floor down here, I seethed and wept and shrieked. I ripped handfuls of brick from the wall and ground them to dust. This awful life without you hurts so *much* ... but I'd rather die than bring you down here with me.When I feel the burning of the sunlight, it will be your kiss, warming me for one last time. I'll burn as I've always burned for you, and the ashes left behind will be my last tribute to you - my heart, my love, my lost Valentine."	t5_2t6kz	True

We met when we were young, too young to know better and too better to make great decisions. High school sweethearts who got knocked up. You know the type. We had dreams that were larger than we were, aspirations larger than mountains and virtually nothing to show for it. It wasn’t a romantic life you’d read about in books.

 

I spent that week planning our vacation, where we would go and what we’d do. We had talked too often about everywhere we should go. I wanted this to be the vacation of a lifetime, because I knew it wasn’t something we could ever do again. I settled on Paris, we could see the Eiffel Tower and sky dive, walk the streets and pretend like we were still young. It took me a year to save up enough money to afford the ticket.

 

We walked the streets, my hands around her. We dined at all the places we had wanted to and I reminisced about the day we met, graduated and when Abby was born. She never liked to talk about Abby, because that meant remembering how Abby died. This vacation was about life and I was sorry I brought it up but it was time to let go. We let go as we walked to the tower, and let go on the elevator ride up. We let go as we gazed out across Paris. We let go of everything. “We’re doing it, Sara. We’re falling through the sky.” I said in the few fleeting moments of our free fall before they were interrupted by the sound of a canister of ashes hitting the pavement. I joined them momentarily and we were once again together.

He'd already passed previous two palate tests, guessing the protein, cooking method and seasoning respectively (Lamb rack, sous vide with a Madeira reduction, Japanese fugu, flash fried with a hint of yuzu). If he passed this test, the protege would be first in line to bear the mantle of the chef's legacy and sprawling restaurant empire. 

""Pan fried. Butter."" The chef nodded. 

""Hint of tarragon?"" Warmer still. The chef beamed. The protein would be the hardest to guess. 

""It's hard to guess. Very tender. It has to be veal."" The master's face fell. The protege slunk from the room without a word, defeated. 

A top chef had to be prepared to cook anything. And for that, his palate had to be exquisitely refined, no combination of tastes could be unknown to him. It would take at least another year to identify and train up another protege. The bitterness the master felt was offset by his recollection of his own sense of triumph when he ripped off his blindfold after identifying the last protein so many years ago. 

With a stroke of his pencil, he crossed out the last line on his testing sheet. *Seven year old girl.*

A gigantic disc, the size of Alaska and several times taller than the Himalayas, hovering over the Pacific ocean. From it, a column, several miles wide was lowered into the ocean and started pumping water into the bowels of what we all referred to as the Mothership, for want of a better word. It's not like they told us what it was called. They didn't tell us anything.

Naturally, we thought they were here to steal our water so we replied with everything we had. Armor penetrating shells, missiles and finally tactical nuclear warheads. I'd seen enough SF to know that they would all just bounce off the shimmering walls of the Mothership, and sure enough – not a scratch. Then they descended to Earth. There were well over 100 different races of aliens, ranging from semi-humanoid, 15 feet tall slender beings with eyes that shone like little suns to amorphous blobs of orange goo who crept along the surface slower than most snails. All protected by the same shields as the Mothership, none of them interacting with us whether we fired upon them or attempted communication. For the most part, they stuck to their respective kind, not doing much at all. No abducted livestock, no crop circles, no nothing.

Then, after a few weeks, they left. Sure, the oceans were a couple of feet lower but other than that it was like they never had been here at all. A couple of crazy cults have sprung up – eagerly awating the return of these modern Gods as soon as whichever ”sins” happened to bother the leaders of the cult had been purged. Some took refuge in the organized madness of conspiracy theories blaming everyone from the UN to the US to the Illuminati for this faked alien invasion.

The host at the inn gives me a warm welcome, but seems oddly nervous, throwing frequent glances out the window towards the mountain. I'm quickly guided to my room on the second floor.

In fact it seems to open upwards.                                                                                      
I fall asleep wondering about this.

Precisely at midnight, I am awakened by an odd sound from above. It sounds like a waterfall in the distance, or static on a TV. Confused, I look up to see that the hatch has been opened. Moonlight falls in through the opening, and the sound increases. An inhuman scream pierces the air. I try the door, but it's locked. A shadow falls over the moon, and I realize why the hatch is there. Why the room is so big and empty. Why the floor is so scratched, like many claws have walked there. 
I realize that the sound of hundreds of wings sounds very much like a waterfall. And I remember the old legends of the evil that inhabits these mountains, and how people learned to live with it.

I stopped washing the dishes, I stopped gazing out the kitchen window at the dark yard, and I sang again, in a trembling falsetto.

I was joined again. And again and again. By my own voice, singing the harmonies. The more I sang, the more I realized that even though it was my own voice, I was now hearing parts that I had not sung yet. It was disturbing and ghostly, but kind of neat.

He approached me warily, glass of beer in hand, and thrust it silently towards me. I tried to drink, but liquid never touched my mouth. Strangely, the man found this hilarious.

Drop to flat-foot too soon and you’ll find a trailing strap has wrapped around the handle of the bike and you’ll find yourself dragged backwards into a clanging mess of tyre and spoke. 


That’s why, for those aching few feet, I’m always on edge. Wondering if I’m going to feel that terrible pull from behind which means that I was too soon, too presumptuous and I wasn’t safe. Still, I suppose, it’s not really the bike’s fault. Not this time. It couldn’t have been the bike.

The mother, not taking her eyes away from the pickle she was cutting, said ""New doll? Did daddy buy it for you?""

The daughter was confused. ""No mommy, the one that you put in my room.""

The mother stopped what she was doing for a moment. ""When did you first see this doll?"" the mother asked suspiciously. 

It took a child a moment to answer ""A long time ago in my closet, just sitting there. He told me that he was scared, and wanted a friend. So I told him that you never look under my bed and you leave me alone at night. So thats when we can play! But, instead, he just sits there and stares at me. It really scaring me mommy.""

The mother froze. Looking down on her daughter, she saw the sincerity in her eyes. Trying to remain calm, the mother asked ""Honey, does this doll actually talk to you, like I talk to daddy and you?""

The little girl nodded. The mother gulped and began to sweat. ""And does he breathe, like you and me?""

The little girl nodded again.

 In a flash, the mother grabbed her daughter, held onto the knife she was using and ran to the next door neighbours house, telling them to call 911.

It had been abandoned for years and few people dared to explore it. This place was subject to several urban myths which is why no one dared to go in. Legend tells of a haunted stairway in the corner of the institute. Many people claim that there are screams coming from within the depths of the stairs, screams saying ""Help me, please help me!"". It is also said that the stairway never ends. Ron knew it couldn't be true, it couldn't be haunted and it couldn't be endless. He approached the stairway; he was gripped with fear.

He started to go down the stairs. He counted every step he took down the stairs to have an idea of how far he had gone. There was no light source; it was pitch black. He aimed his flashlight into the depths and felt uneasy about continuing. That is when he started to hear people screaming ""Help me, please help me!""

Ron didn't want to go any further after hearing those screams. He had counted how many steps he had taken; 150 steps. He quickly made his way up the stairs counting the steps as he went. When he reached 150 steps, the exact number of steps he had taken while going down, he was shocked to realize that the entrance was nowhere in sight, there was only darkness ahead of him.

He frantically ran up the stairs for minutes but couldn't see the entrance. His flashlight suddenly stopped working, leaving him in complete darkness. It wasn't possible, he thought to himself, maybe he had counted the steps incorrectly. After running up the stairs for ten minutes, he finally started to believe all the stories he had heard. The stairs were haunted and anyone who wandered too far would be lost forever. Ron looked up and started screaming ""Help me, please help me!"""	t5_2t6kz	True

But you see, I remember that day on the overpass. I remember the rain, the thunder, and I remember how *angry*. I was at him. I remember everything in shades of gray, the gunmetal clouds, the slate road, and his sick, gray face. I remember yelling at him to get the fuck out, that I was sick of being his friend if he was just going to keep fucking up like this. I remember being angry enough to follow him out and start pushing him. I remember him kneeling in the swirling rainwater and crying, and I remember punching his stupid fucking face, to get that fucking look off of it. I remember him standing up and punching back and suddenly I wanted to hurt him. I remember dragging him over to the edge. I've always been stronger than him, ever since we were kids. I remember, I *clearly* remember, pushing him against the railing, making him look me in the face. I remember the railing giving way. I swear I don't remember doing that on purpose, but I do remember him toppling over, suddenly overbalancing me. I remember that I had to let him go, or the both of us would have gone over. I remember what he sounded like hitting the bottom, like a sack of flour dropped on the steps. 

I remember the scabrous, mottled body that crept from the side of the highway. It crouched over his body. Its tongue came out and licked the blood coming from the corner of his mouth, cartoonishly long. Its whole body was wrong. Its head was too big, its legs too small, its arms far, far too long. It dragged his body to the side of the road, and it ripped into him like an overripe fruit, the juice of his blood the only bright color on its gray, sore-covered body. It looked up at me and made eye contact. It grinned, shredded meat stuck between its sharp teeth. 

And here he is again. I think I'm glad he's okay. If he's still in there. But I don't think that's the case. I think the thing from under the overpass is wearing him like a suit. I think that I'm in trouble, because I know what's behind the mask. And because I think it followed me home tonight. I think it knows I'm alone.

Say there, old son ... earlier in the evening, I recall that you'd inquired if I'd ever been to India. I haven't; but it reminded me of a ... shall we say, an *odd* story that I don't think I've ever told you. It concerns a young man that I once knew, a strange fellow who was obsessed with discovering the secret of *vita aeterna*, life eternal. He was the nephew of my father's accountant, and he frequented the same social circles as I.

I'd heard that he'd taken a sabbatical to the far East, in pursuit of his morbid fascination. A year or two later, I saw him at a dinner party, an event that was organized in honor of a certain political figure at the time. He took me aside when the opportunity arose and informed me, his eye twitching, that he had divined the secret while deep in the heart of Indo-China. ""When someone dies ... and if your mind is open ... you can see their soul departing,"" he told me, then smiled. It was a ghastly grin, one that spoke of things which are best left unspoken. ""If you can *see* it,"" he continued, ""then you can *catch* it.""

Soon after, he was accused of the grisly murder of a prostitute, and his father helped him flee the country to avoid prosecution. That dinner party was the last I saw of the man - until a few days ago, that is. I was checking out of a hotel in New York when, through the glass of the lobby doors, I noticed a shabby-looking gent who was furtively negotiating with an attractive young prostitute. I am old, and my eyes aren't what they used to be ... but it was *him*, I am sure of it. He must have felt my gaze, and when he registered who I was, he quickly turned and outright fled from the scene. What troubles me most is this: I last saw him forty-seven years ago. He should be an old man now, just as I am.

He remembered a time when he drank his earl gray and it would nary cause him grief; now, it's chamomile or nothing.  He could recall his first taste of tea.  It was 1967 and the strong taste, the taste and the flavor, filled him even now.  He recalled pouring the remnant boiled water onto the child he lured there. The screams were equally as potent.  They dug the boy up in 1992, I believe.

Right after that he left home.  Taking his father's keys to his Ford, leaving his parents buried together and the dogs left on the porch to mold and rot.  Those were his formative years.  Taking in hitchhikers.  Boiling their fingers in his tea.  He could taste the nigh imperceptible nodes of blood, which added quite positively to the flavor.  He wondered if they were all found.  He might one morning, reading his newspaper and drinking his tea, catch a story about half a dozen bodies being disinterred from improvised graves off dirt roads and wonder.

His last one — last, he though, so terminal! — was in the fall of 1989 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He became careless by allowed this male prostitute to escape.  He could squeal, he could end everything.

He was on a very long, straight, and rural road in the middle of Oregon and there was nothing around him for 100's of miles. The landscape stretched out in pure darkness in all directions. He was sure he hadn't seen a car coming from the other direction and he didn't remember seeing any headlights coming from an off road, so where did those tail lights come from? 

Even stranger was how they didn't seem to be getting farther away. In fact, it seemed like they were getting closer to him. Every time he looked up to his mirror, the lights seemed a little bigger, a little brighter, and definitely a little closer. But how could that be? Why would anyone be driving this fast in reverse? He decided to stop and see if the lights passed him. 

The eerie red lights got bigger and bigger in his rear view mirror until all he could see was red. He turned around to look out the back window and realized, far too late, that the red lights in his rear view were not, in fact, tail lights..."	t5_2t6kz	True

No problem, we can fix that with drugs with very few side effects and a small dose of radiation to the brain, no worse than standing in front of a microwave oven for a minute.

Then we also have a more, let's say radical, option. If you have been diagnosed with something bad which will lead to a slow and painful death, we can make sure that you will be assassinated before it is too late.

We only work using the finest hitmen in the world, if you don't mind me bragging a bit. Naturally this is very expensive, but then again, you can't take it with you.

She was so good to me, she understood that I didn't get out much, but still I mistook the tired look on her face for anger.

I remember the moment the tires slipped and the car lost control. The oncoming headlights, the jackknifing semi, the hood of the Delta crumbling like tin foil. I remember with the most unimaginably vivid detail the haunting quiet as the rear lifted, crescendoing to a groan of twisting steel nuanced by the unmistakable cracking of bones just after I put my hand over hers. The sounds of slow moving traffic on the wet road, the sirens after what seemed like days, the fire squad prying the roof open, the paramedics removing us.

I watched the bodies of my wife and daughter being bagged up. I remember the shaky ambulance ride, the monitors and constant CPR, the gurney to the ICU. I remember the moment I realized that I had lost all control of my body. It was the same moment they declared my death, when I struggled and failed to tell them I could still hear them. I remember the preparation, the funeral, the lowering, the burial, and the endless silence ever since.

She awakens, skin prickling, hair raised. Something’s wrong. She reflexively reaches over to wake her husband only to realize he’s not there. Of course. Emily puts on her robe and slippers, tiptoes into the moonlit hallway. She hears a slight rustle, a punishing silence, and then a louder rustle.

Emily peeks into her daughter’s room, expecting, hoping, to see the typical bulge from under the bedsheets, as familiar as the taste of water. Even in the dark she can feel the presence of her beloved Katie and even begins to walk away, another reflex, chalk it up to the foolish worries of a mother, when she replays the image in her head.

It was clear I was different to everyone else, and they never hesitated to remind me of that. They always laughed as I got help from my teaching assistant; they made sure I felt embarrassed and ashamed whenever they could. I could feel them laughing, mocking me.

Whilst learning to read I’d feel them sniggering in the background. I’d watch as the teacher would point in their face, giving them some stern words. “Yeah really helpful” I thought.
I remember running home after school as fast as I could every time. I wasn’t like everyone else, I never watched TV or spoke to the other kids; in fact art was really my only outlet and relief.  One particular night after school I went to my usual “safe haven”.
I sat there crying in the forest; tucked up inside a hollowed out tree trunk. It was beautiful. I sat there for ages as the raindrops hit the trunk above me. I created the most beautiful, fantasy world I could ever dream of. The rain never ceased up once, and I couldn’t be happier.
The following week I noticed one of my bullies had been absent, as the police came to talk to us. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together, as I watched my class mates erupt into tears. 
My bully’s body was found at the bottom of a well in a nearby flooded wood. No one heard his cries for help; not even me. He must have been so scared, burning out his vocal chords as the rain fell harder and faster.
I was still bullied as the only deaf kid in school, but I always remembered one thing my mum had taught me.
Sticks and stones may break my bones. But words will never hurt me. 
I never returned to my safe haven again.

Drying his tears with a swipe of his threadbare tunic, Ralph shuffled over to the bleary wax-paper window and looked up at a gray, roiling sky: there would be another storm later in the day, and it would be a bad one. No wonder everyone was up and busy so early today - later on, they would all be forced to huddle together inside of their dilapidated little houses; they would weep and pray that the fury of the storm would not destroy them with crackling spears of lightning and roaring, caustic winds. The old man observed wisps of acrid-looking smoke drifting past the window, and knew that a fire was already being stoked in the pit, hot and merciless.

A bony fist pounded on the door, hard enough to make the rotting plywood jump in its frame. On the other side, a man's voice rasped, ""Come on, you old buzzard, get on out here before we come in and getcha. You know that we will.""

I go into the kitchen to start some coffee and pull some things out of the fridge to bring with me to work. While I wait for the coffee I take my puppy for a walk. She lacks bladder control so we have to put her in her crate at night. When I go to leash her up I notice she's nervous. The hair on her back is straight up, which usually only happens when she sees a stranger she doesn't like. Again I shrug it off and we go for a pleasant 10 minute walk. I return to the things I pulled from the fridge on the floor, unpackaged and destroyed. It couldn't have been the cats because I close the bedroom door so the dog doesn't jump on my girlfriend and wake her up.

This makes me nervous. I check the guest bedroom and bathroom and walk back into the main area stumped. I start to pick up everything off the floor when I hear the noise. A faint rustling from across the room where the patio leads to the deck. My dog heard it too, because she had placed herself between the noise and me, growling protectively. I looked up and saw a shape behind the curtain silhouetted by the rising sun. It was large, menacing, and definitely not outside on the patio."	t5_2t6kz	True

No, it's not a vast sulfuric inferno populated by the damned and their horned pitchfork-wielding tormentors. What an absurd notion! Something only a bunch of illiterate desert people could come up with. A desert hell of a desert god, but I digress...

Hell is nothing of the sort because hell is not a place, it's knowledge. A deep, unforgiving, merciless knowledge of everything your life could have been, but weren't. That scraggly stranger on the street you didn't condescend to acknowledge, that girl you weren't brave enough to tell your true feeling to, that job offer you made some stupid excuse not to take. Hell, even that time you turned down your friend's invitation to a dinner party because you felt insecure about going out that night... You couldn't be blamed, because you didn't know the repercussions of your actions. But in hell, in hell every twist of fate and every possible combination of your seemingly minor interactions is revealed in full.

What you could have done, but didn't. Who you could have loved, but hadn't. What opportunities you had, but did not bother with.

And above all, what you could have been, but weren't.

So no, hell is not a place. Far from it. Hell is a deep, unforgiving, and merciless *regret*."	t5_2t6kz	True

I am ashamed to admit that, but the thought of Fiona sends chills down my spine.  I locked myself in the garage and spent last night in my car.  I didn’t go back in the house until the sun had come up this morning.  My son was sitting in the living room watching TV.  I made him some cereal and took him to school.  At no point did I go anywhere near his room.  

When I picked him up from school he wouldn’t stop talking about her.  He ate dinner then darted straight back to his room.  I didn’t hear him make a peep until a few minutes ago.  It’s late and he came in to my office.  He told me that Fiona was upset I stood her up last night.  He said he would go get her and bring her to my office before running off to his room again. 

Now I’m sitting in my office with the door locked and my son keeps trying the doorknob.  I want to answer it, but I’m afraid.  I can see two sets of shadows under the door and now I can make out what Fiona is whispering.

Years of practice had taught him that the second and sixth steps down from the landing were the ones that complained the loudest at night, so he deftly glided over them. He whispered to Roxy before she could bark at him, and told her to stay. Oddly enough, she did. Mouth watering, Jerry didn’t even have to turn on the kitchen light, what with the full moon being in his favor on this particular evening. Everything was going absolutely, positively, perfectly.

The fall was great enough to have cracked her pelvis, a potentially fatal injury at her age. She could only be sure of her left leg which she could see by looking up from the floor. The bone had snapped out of its original shape into an aggressively acute angle. She prayed for her son Gabe to come home soon. Reaching her cell phone without screaming wasn’t a problem, it was important to suffer through the pain. It was important for Gabe to see her like this, sprawled out like a broken doll. It was important that Gabe called the paramedics and waited frantically for them to take her to a hospital. It was important for Gabe to feel guilty for throwing her away...for throwing away the mother who loved and cared for him since he was born. He’ll feel so guilty about trading his poor mother in for flashy whores that he wouldn’t dream of sending her back to North Carolina. The two of them would have plenty of time together in the months of physical therapy to come, unless the fall crippled her permanently. Martha thought it better not to get her hopes up... if her spine had been injured she wouldn’t feel the piercing pain in her shin. The length of recovery was of little consequence, all that mattered was Gabe being in her life again. They would talk together, eat together, and he would finally care for her as much as she did for him. If he tries to stray during her recovery, she planned to fall off something higher than a staircase.

I've had 7 years of this shit, this hell called a marriage. You have failed as a man, unable to give me a child. And yet your expectations of me have never yielded, despite your failing of the one thing I longed for, the one thing that allowed me to tolerate you for so long. Divorce is not an option for us, as you well know, by your repeated threats of what you would ""do"" if I ever left you, if I ever conspired against you. 

Stupid man. You think you hold power against me? Every raised fist, every hurtful word spat, every forced evening of ""release,"" was just more time for me to think about how I would get rid of you. Night after night, I stand over you, willing myself to do it. Tonight, the knife is in hand you fucking prick! 

""Nooooo! You were asleep!""

""I've always felt your fat ass breathing heavily over me you dumb bitch!"" 

I find comfort in the finality of the burning of the blade. A calculated win/win really. At least you are a man of your word. And when the detectives find my diary, well...

I hope you enjoy prison, you fucking coward.

**FROM:** Sydney Campbell Bennett, *President, United Earth*    
**RE:** Hesperus II    
**MESSAGE:** They tell me time moves faster for us here on Earth. Here, many generations have passed since we foresaw the necessity of last-ditch measures, sending you out among the stars on little more than a wing and a prayer. We have survived long enough to receive failure messages from all the other seed-ships, and we shall not last much longer.    
But we die knowing there is hope. Though you traveled the farthest, you were the best candidate for the continuation of our species. Grow, prosper, and make us proud. A star gave us life, and in return we have given life to the stars.

Godspeed, Hope.

Discovered catastrophic crust collapse due to massive meteor strike. Hesperus is a cinder, no chance of supporting life. Mission failure.    
&gt;Time is short. Knew this trip was one-way, and have accepted our fate. We pray the other ships succeeded.

&gt;Godspeed, Earth.

If you feel my teeth, I'll just make the arm I'm chewing numb.

If you hear my gnawing, I'll be sure to cut that sound out of your hearing straight away.

If you should happen to taste the harsh taste of blood on the air, I'll knock out the taste buds that taste such things. Same goes for your curious nose.

Of course, if you manage to see me or, more likely, see your missing limb, that can become your newest blind spot. You already have more than you think, and I can use all of them to hide.

Lastly, don't even think about trying to get up from where you're sitting in front of your computer in order to tell someone; I'll warp your mind so that while you think you're alerting someone to your plight, you're really just lolling vacantly in your chair.

1362529704.0	19qqph	Madam, as your husband...	Grakmarr	76	23	29	"Nancy was the most astonishing partner I'd ever had, and I'd had quite a few in my day. Not that I was some debonair playboy, just that I'd often gotten it so horrendously wrong. But with her, everything seemed to fall neatly into place. We shared the same values, priorities, and interests. Even our temperaments and humors seemed so perfectly aligned. I vowed an oath right then and there that were Nancy not the match for me, then match there would never be.

So after four years of courtship, she and I were bound together in matrimony. Thus spawned my undoing, the details of which I am now set to relate. The first years of our union were prosperous in the form of a delightful young lad, Anthony. As time wore on, the struggles of my occupation and the lady's most intemperate disposition (and how I once lauded it as a reflection of my own!) led to the inevitable dissolution of our once amicable union, though we remained bound by the mutually-perceived necessity of our boy's proper upbringing.

It was noonday in January when the event occurred. Nancy brought me my cup of tea, as was our custom despite much quarreling the night prior. She lingered as I sipped it absently whilst studying the day's paper. The tremors began in earnest as I quite appropriately reached the obituaries. My countenance fell upon Nancy, who only then saw fit to gleefully inform me of the arsenic in my tea. Though the final darkness hastened, providence blessed me with the strength to utter my final three words upon this mortal coil; after which I happily died, having seen them forever wipe that gods-damned smirk from her face.

Comes a plinking, tinkling song.

It pulls you up the darkened stairs,

Your mind on ballets, horses, fairs.

Those metal tines, those grinding gears,

Are raspy music to your ears.

They whir, they spin, within the gloom,

And beckon you toward that room

Where summers stay, and laughs, and love –

Sweet childish memories it sings of.

The dust lies thick upon the floor,

To hush your steps so near the door,

And moonlight, pale, glows from the crack,

But as you reach, it fades to black, 

And with a plink… 

a plink… 

a plink…

The music stops. You twitch, and blink,

Then raise your palm, for there you see –

You hold the music box’s key.

So with a shiver, shake, and swear,

You turn and drift back down the stairs.

You wonder why you left your chair –

A phone call? A forgotten care?

Then down the hallway, nice and long,

Comes a plinking, tinkling song…

Anyway, the other night I went to open up a new document in order to type up a fabulous new short story I'd written. The story, called The Cryer, was a horror piece about a man who loses his eyes in an accident, goes insane, and begins taking the eyes of children. 

I clicked on the document and nearly fell out of my chair because there he was: the cryer. Just as I'd imagined him: shrieking in mid-grimace with blood trickling down his face. I quickly closed out of the window and tried to catch my breath. Maybe I'd seen the idea for The Cryer somewhere else, copied a picture to my desktop, and subconsciously written a story about it. I thought ""a Google search should clear this up."" 

When I clicked on the browser I actually did fall out of my chair. Because now the cryer was back on my screen, just as before. Except this time he was smiling. More of a sinister grin, than a happy smirk. 

That's when I heard the knock on the window. 

My curiosity won over my petrifying fear. I drew the curtains open. 

Written in blood on the window were the words:
Thank You. "	t5_2t6kz	True
