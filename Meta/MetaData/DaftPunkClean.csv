1369148609.0	1erm5v	Played RAM on vinyl for my parents straight through. Here are their thoughts:	jackflash53	447	37	87	"So after getting the vinyl in the mail yesterday, I decided to play it for my 61 year old father and 56 year old mother, not sure of what they would think. They had heard some Daft Punk before and, unfortunately, were hit and miss on some. But RAM was something special. 

My father couldn't get over the quality of the ""studio sound"" I like to say. As someone who used to go to Studio 54 in its heyday, he LOVED disco. 

He instantly got into the great licks from Nile Rodgers, the haunting lyrics from Paul Williams (whom he remembered from Phantom of the Paradise from way back in the day), and the harmonizing from the robots through the vocoder. 

My mother was a little tougher to get into it for some songs. But I loved seeing her start to sing ""Lose Yourself To Dance"" over and over as I saw it get stuck into her head like it already has in mine. 

Finally, I'll leave you with my two favorite parts of the entire listening experience:

First, my father had just gotten back from a week long business trip to Europe including Holland and London. As soon as Get Lucky came on, he said ""I know this one! I heard it over in London!"" and then preceded to not only sing all of the lyrics to it, but turn the music louder and start dancing all over the room. He said it made him feel like he was back in the old dance clubs again. I really wish I had gotten a chance to record it. 

Secondly, my mother really got into a song I wouldn't have expected her to get into: Doin' It Right. While my father wasn't a fan of what he dubbed ""repetitive lyrics"" (although he admitted Panda Bears part made it better), my mother started dancing around the room, much like my father had earlier. 

Overall, they thought it was a great album to listen to and they certainly felt Daft Punk captured that disco sound they were going for. They couldn't really find one bad song on the entire album. It speaks volumes that an album can cross generations and appeal to different backgrounds, just like it has with my parents and me. 

I hope this brings a smile to your face today like it did to mine yesterday :)"	t5_2qtn5	True

I've been around since Homework and I remember people being outraged when One More Time came out. ""What is this disco-pop bullshit?"". People expected more house music. People were disappointed with HAA because it wasn't accessible like Discovery. So now people are upset that RAM isn't like what they're familiar with. It happens every time. Daft Punk will never give you the same thing twice and that's why they're great. Just doing what worked before is easy. This is different. I think it's brilliant and if you disagree that's fine but I just don't know why you'd expect anything different from Daft Punk."	t5_2qtn5	True

edit: I hope no one get's too upset, it's all in good fun and remember to be good to one another, there is 74 minute's of magic almost a month away!

edit 2: I was a periwinkle, I need this

edit 3: I leave to write a 3 hour exam and I come back to this. I am now kind of nervous to be the spokesperson of team ""fake,"" but my constitution remains unwavering. I figure I'll explain my position, for whatever it's worth. My favorite theory behind it all is that Daft Punk themselves sent out a unmastered/unfinished version of the track, just to test the waters to see if anyone would leak it outright. It would both help still the waters that the hype has created by allowing some people to lower their expectations, and give good cover for premiering the real deal. I just can't ignore the extra guitar parts in collaborators vid's, the lack of any real nile's groovin, the poorly produced nature of it all, poor transitions, and that 6 seconds of weird synth at the end.

The Daft Punk marketing team thus far has gone above and beyond any album campaign in a decade with the key aspect being a locked down album, and I think this premiere could be the icing on the cake. I know many of you are happy with what we've been given, maybe even worried about being let down, but as a periwinkle, and as a daft punk fan, I say the robots are up to something glorious. My dream might be shattered tonight at 10 pm my time, but half the fun of this whole journey has been speculation and debate! Let's hope for the best, and even worst case scenario the robots will have 68 more minutes to get the rest of us dancin, hell I might even listen to this fake if I find myself staring out at a beach in my car

See you all tonight!


Edit: I'll keep it intact for anyone who's laughing right now

As I'm sitting there waiting to get my card and receipt back, her head starts bobbing, and smile slowly creeps across her face. When she hands me the card she's says something like ""ooooh like this song"". I told her its going to be the next big hit and drove off. 


Here's where I may get into downvote alley, but I think it is worth noting that this drive thru employee was a grumpy black girl, probably about my age 25, and I'm this yuppie white boy in a suit with parted hair.

I also thought it could be cool to list any interviews which might be scheduled.

The past year of my life has been dreadful. I've failed multiple classes in college. I've lost all of my drive. I was rejected by the only girl I ever had any feelings for. I lost some good friends and don't even talk to them anymore. I broke my humerus and lost 7 months of hard work in the gym. I have an undiagnosed issue with my spleen and lower intestines. I've scrambled for cash for much of the year. All of my friends graduated and moved away, and I was left in the same city with only a small fraction of friends left.


I've been so, so sad.


I can honestly say that today was the first day I've felt real joy in a long, long time.



Thank you, Daft Punk. Thank you, r/DaftPunk.



Edit: I tried to reply to almost everyone, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for your support. I know that a lot of us are going through some tough times, and I can't think of anything more enjoyable than to kick back and let our troubles temporarily melt away in pure audio bliss.

IIRC, the iTunes stream will be one continuous album and not break apart the songs in any way. I have calculated the beginning of each song as it will most likely appear on the stream. These are the starting times:

* Give Life Back To Music - 0:00

* The Game of Love - 4:34

* Giorgio by Moroder - 9:56

* Within - 19:00

* Instant Crush - 22:48

**Giorgio by Moroder**  
*(Narration by Giorgio)*  
""When I was 15, 16, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible, because it was-- the dream was so big, that I didn't see any chance, because I was living in a little town-- I was studying. And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought 'Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance.' Because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music.""

""At that time in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe 30 minutes, I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car, because I didn't want to drive home. And that helped me for about almost 2 years to survive, in the beginning.""

""I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s, and then have **a** sound of the future. And I said 'Wait, a second-- I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer, which IS the sound of the future.' And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click, so we put the click on the 24 track, which then was synced to the Moog module. I knew that could be a sound of the future. But I didn't realize how much the impact would be.""

""My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me 'Giorgio'.""  
*(Epic stuff for awhile)*  
""Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being 'correct', you can do whatever you want-- so, nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.""  
*(More epic stuff til song end)*  

**Within**  
*(Intro)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
There are so many things that I don't understand  
There a world within me that I cannot explain  
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same  
I am lost, I can't even remember my name  
*(Chorus x2)*  
I've been for some time  
Looking for some one  
I need to know now  
please tell me who I am?  
*(Verse 2)*  
There are so many things that I don't understand  
There's a world within me that I cannot explain  
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same (where are the locks to try the key?)  
I am lost, I can't even remember my name (and I wonder-- why?)  
*(Chorus x4)*  
I've been for some time  
Looking for some one  
I need to know now  
please tell me who I am?  

**Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas)**  
EDIT: This one is HARD. Suggestions are welcome. Anything with a (?) I am unsure about.

*(Intro)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
I didn't want to be the one to forget  
I thought of everything I'd never regret  
A little time with you is all that I get  
That's all we need because it's all we can take  

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I want to take you to that place in the ""Roche""  
But nobody gives us any time any more  

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog  
You made an offer for it, then you ran off  
I got this picture of us kids in my head  
And all I hear is the last thing that you said:  

*(Bridge)*  
'I listened to your problems, now listen to mine'  
I didn't want to anymore (Oh...)

*(Chorus)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  

And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again...

*(Verse 2)*  
It didn't matter what they wanted to see  
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me  
The summer memory that just never dies  
We worked too long and hard to give it no time  

He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies  
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise  
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall  
He cannot break it down or else he would fall  

*(Bridge)*  
One thousand lonely stars  
hiding in the cold  

Take it, I don't want to sing any more...

*(Guitar Break)*  
*(Bridge)*  
'I listened to your problems, now listen to mine'  
I didn't want to anymore (Oh...)

*(Chorus)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  

And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a-

I don't understand, don't get upset  
I'm not with you  
We're swimming around, that's all I do, when I'm with you.

*(Chorus x2)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door

**Lose Yourself to Dance (feat. Pharrell Williams)**  
*(Guitar Intro)*  
*(Verse)*

**Touch (feat. Paul Williams)**  
*(Spacey Intro with Robot Voice)*  
Touch. Touch-- I remember touch.  
Touch. Touch-- I remember touch.  
Where do I belong?  
Touch. I need something more.  
I remember touch. I need something more in my mind.  

*(Paul Williams Verse)*  
Touch. I remember touch.  
Pictures came with touch, a painter in my mind--tell me what you see?  
A tourist in a dream, a visitor it seems  
a half-forgotten song, where do I belong?  
Tell me what you see, I need something more  

*(beat drops)*  
Kiss suddenly alive, happiness arrive  
hunger like a storm, how do I begin?  
A room within room, a door behind a door  
Touch, where do you lead? I need something more  
Tell me what you see, I need something more 

*(Strings, Piano/Brass Break)*  
*(Spacey slow-down)*  
Home, hold on--if love is the answer, you're home (x8)

*(Spacey break, drums, strings, choral)*  
Home, hold on--if love is the answer, you're home (x8)

*(Outro)*  
Touch, sweet touch  
you've give me too much to feel  
Sweet touch, you've almost convinced me I'm real  
I need something more, I need something more.  

**Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams)**

*(Verse)*  
Like the legend of the phoenix (ha), all ends with beginnings  
What keeps the planet spinning (ah), the force from the beginning (look-)  
*(Bridge)*  
We've come too far to give up who we are  
So let's raise the bar, and our cups to the stars  
*(Chorus)*  
She's up all night til the sun  
I'm up all night to get some  
She's up all night for good fun

So let's raise the bar, and our cups to the stars

She's up all night til the sun  
I'm up all night to get some  
She's up all night for good fun

*(Guitar Outro)*  

**Beyond**  
*(Epic String Intro)*  
*(Verse)*  
Dream, beyond dream  
beyond life, you will find your song.  
Before sound, to be found  
close your eyes and rise.  
Higher still, endless thrill  
to the land of love.  
Beyond love, come alive  
angel eye, forever watching you and I.  
You are the night, you are the ocean  
You are the light behind a cloud  
You are the end and the beginning  
A world where time is not allowed  
There's no such thing as competition  
To find our way, we lose control  
Remember, love's our only mission  
This is a journey of the soul  
The perfect song is framed with silence  
It speaks of places never seen  
Your home's a promise long forgotten  
It is the birthplace of your dreams  
*(Outro)*

**Motherboard**  
(Instrumental, no lyrics)  

**Fragments of Time (feat. Todd Edwards)**  
*(Intro)*  
*(Verse)*  
Driving this road down to paradise  
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise  
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end  
If I had my way I would never leave  
keep building these random memories  
turning our days into melodies  
but since I can't stay...
*(Chorus x2)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go, these moments will shine  
*(Verse)*
Familiar faces I've never seen  
living the gold and the silver dream  
making me feel like i'm seventeen  
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end  
If I had my way I would never leave  
keep building these random memories  
turning our days into melodies  
but since I can't stay...  
*(Chorus x2)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go, these moments will shine  
*(Guitar &amp; Disco Break)*  
*(Chorus)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go, these moments will shine  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
these moments will shine 


**Doin' it Right (feat. Panda Bear)**  
*(Vocoder Repeated Throughout, 6x before Panda Bear comes in)*

Everybody will be dancing and we're feeling alright  
Everybody will be dancing tonight

If you do it right, let it go all night  
shadows on you break out into the light  
*(Chorus)*  
If you lose your way tonight

*(Vocoder 1x before Panda Bear, then repeated throughout)*

""Hey Bob, I'm looking at what Jack was talking about-- and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby. It is a bright object, and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing. It's way out in the distance, apparently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion, because the flashes come around almost on time. As we look back at Earth, it's up at about 11 o'clock, oh maybe 10 or 12 diam- Earth diameters. I don't know if that does you any good, but there's *something* out there.""

The most recent 5 or 6 albums put up for exclusive stream, including Justin Timberlake, Phoenix, Kenny Chesney (barf), and more were all posted in the afternoon or evening.

Don't get me wrong, I want to hear it ASAP like everyone else. I just mention this all because there is no precedent for an album being put up at midnight and I don't want everyone to be up all night to get RAAAAGE.

**THE GAME OF LOVE**

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love

And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love

And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay

And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay

**WITHIN**

There are so many things
that I don't understand
There's a world within me
that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore
but the doors look the same
I am lost I can't even remember my name

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

There are so many things
that I don't understand
There's a world within me
that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore
but the doors look the same
(where are the locks to try the key)
I am lost I can't even remember my name
(and I wonder why)

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

**INSTANT CRUSH**

I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I got
That's all we need because its all we can take

One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place on the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall

1000 lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't want to sing anymore

'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...

I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you...
We're swimming around, it's all I do,
when I'm with you

**LOSE YOURSELF TO DANCE**

I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead
and wipe up all the
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Everybody's dancing on the floor
Getting ready for more

Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

**TOUCH**

Touch
I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half forgotten song
Where do I belong
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss
Suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hungry like a storm
How do I begin
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

If love is the answer you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer you're home

Touch
Sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real

I need something more
I need something more

**GET LUCKY**

Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has not ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling
If you want to leave I'm with it

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

**BEYOND**

Dream
Beyond dream
Beyond life
You will find
Your

Song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes
And

Rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land
Of

Love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel Eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night
You are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed

There's no such thing as a competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

**FRAGMENTS OF TIME**

Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep holding these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep holding these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

**DOIN' IT RIGHT**

Doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right"	t5_2qtn5	True

He is a dj, but wanted to actually participate in the festivities so he asked me to step in and do some very light dj work (spin records and such).

My friend comes up to me after the song and says he overheard a guy say ""Wow, they are playing some old classics right now."" I think that really speaks to the timelessness of this album.

I agree that many listeners were just looking for another face-melting, EDM drop.  However, many listeners with legitimate, but different tastes than my own just aren't digging it.  Why can't this be ok?  

This album is good on it's own.  However, I would question logic that says. ""Daft Punk made it, therefore it's the future of music.""  This kind of sentiment is more a fixation with celebrity than the music itself -- the opposite of what two guys wearing Robot masks would have.  

This album is a statement of love for an older style that had been shelved.  It is a breath of new life into the corpse of disco.  It is NOT a middle finger to Skrillex, but a hug for disco legends.  

Stop making this album, this statement of love, out to be a war cry.

edit: I acknowledge what many of you are saying about Daft's criticisms of EDM in their interviews.  So, I'll clarify: I'm not trying to say that Daft isn't at all critical of the current scene, but I'm trying to ask that that their thoughtful (and artfully expressed) criticism isn't turned by their fans into outright genre bashing.  It was only a few decades ago that this same level of anti-genre fervor lead to burning disco records en masse.    "	t5_2qtn5	True

1365919769.0	1cbb9u	Daft Punk-Phoenix Single Song Collaboration Coachella Watch Thread! Or DPPSSCCWT for short	milliondollarboy1	163	29	571	"Due to the popularity of my [SNL Watch Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1cb1ee/snl_0413_watch_thread/) I'd figure the possibility of seeing Daft Punk play with Phoenix wouldn't hurt to discuss and watch live together. I won't be constantly updating, this is more for discussion and circlejerking.

Edit 1: https://twitter.com/FrontStagePass Front Stage Pass just confirmed that Daft Punk will show up tonight.

Edit 2: Got more Raisin Bran

Edit 3: Coachella stream: http://www.youtube.com/user/coachella

Edit 4: Fuck it, I will be constantly updating.

Edit 5: I really really like The XX.

Edit 6: Really liked The XX's intro jam, even though it was at the end. Now they're off. Phoenix should be on any minute now!

Edit 7: [Meanwhile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxBc6JjKSWU)

Edit 8: Phoenix just walked out on stage in an epic fashion.

Edit 9: Who's this rapper? This is just pissing me off now.

Edit 10: We have been R. Kelly'd. 

Edit 11: Daft Punk cheers!

Edit 12: Oh my god I'm gonna kill myself.

Final edit: Fuck this, fuck you, fuck Front Stage Pass, fuck Raisin Bran. I'm out.

'nother edit: Look, I'm sorry. I'm only human. Phoenix put on a great show... But damn. I stayed up 'til 3 for this?

So when RAM was announced i was ecstatic. Yesterday however when it was leaked, i listened to the entire thing front to back in one sitting, and you know what? I hated it. This wasn't the Daft Punk I'd known and loved. This isn't the album I've been waiting for! I felt cheated. Today I listened to the album again, this time i really listened. With an open mind. I realized something: the Daft Punk i had wanted was just an extension of Human or Discovery. When those albums were released they were cutting edge new sounds. Now 7 years later those sounds have been used time and time again, copied and recopied, beaten to death by every DJ ever. How could they not do something new? I had forgotten what Daft Punk was: cutting edge dance music. CUTTING EDGE, not recycled club music. They are innovators, ahead of their time maybe but unique none the less. I now love everything about this new album. Except the ninth time you listen to Giorgio by moroder, him talking for the first two minutes can get a little much. 

TL;DR Hated the new album. Realized how innovative it is, love it now."	t5_2qtn5	True

Everyone came outside to watch a slideshow the father had done and they wanted to do Hava Nagilah (and the chair dance) while everyone was outside, but the mother wanted to get the older people dancing for a few songs first. I hit 'em with Prince/Kiss first, with Isley Bros/Shout right before Hava Nagilah. 

&gt;In between, I played Get Lucky. I don't think they consciously knew that it was a very new song or that it was Daft Punk or anything else about it, but it just made people dance. It was kinda magical. Sometimes you hear something like that and you wonder if it will be a mainstream hit - sometimes people just don't ""get"" songs. But I think this one sounds like it could be from any of the last 3 decades, and it had that effect on the dance floor.

Hey! I'm Jake, I make music as Needless Noise. But this post isn't about me.

Last year I started a project called Alive 2012. I was gonna mash up every DP track from their studio albums into an ""ideal"" DP live show. I got pretty well into it, but never finished.

Now that RAM is out, I'm trying again.

Alive 2013 will feature **every** Daft Punk Album track from Homework to RAM, along with a few side project tracks, remixes, Tron tracks, etc. It's not just a playlist of DP songs, though, I have logged the key and tempo of all these songs to provide mashups of each, I do a tiny bit of remixing/editing myself too. I use some of the mashup ideas used from Alive 2007, but I've discovered some magical combinations of my own too.

The tracklisting (with RAM tracks highlighted):

1. End Of Line (Boys Noize Remix) / **Giorgio By Moroder** / The Grid (9:45)

2. **Give Life Back To Music** / **Fragments Of Time** / Rollin' &amp; Scratchin' (6:24)

3. Technologic / Television Rules The Nation / **Motherboard** (7:39)

4. Revolution 909 / Aerodynamic / High Life / **Lose Yourself To Dance** (3:56)

5. Superheroes / **Get Lucky** / Human After All / Musique

6. Burnin' / Harder Better Faster Stronger

7. Around The World / Harder Better Faster Stronger Remixes

8. Phoenix / Emotion

9. One More Time / So Much Love To Give

10. Digital Love / High Fidelity / **Touch**

11. Around The World (Halftime)

12. Fresh / Indo Silver Club / Make Love / Voyager

13. Derezzed / Mothership Reconnection / Teachers

14. **Instant Crush** / **Lose Yourself To Dance** / **Beyond** / **Get Lucky**

15. **The Game Of Love** / Veridis Quo / Something About Us / **Within**

16. Crescendolls / Too Long / Around The World / Aura Rock

17. The Son Of Flynn / Encom (Com Truise Remix)

18. Da Funk / Daftendirekt / Oh Yeah

19. Face To Face / Short Circuit 

20. Together / Music Sounds Better With You / Aerodynamite / Drive

21. Robot Rock / Daft Punk Is Playing At My House / **Doin' It Right**

22. ENCORE: Human After All Remixes / **Beyond** / **Contact** / Steam Machine

You can find a ""full"" tracklisting, that includes all the samples used in each track, here: http://pastebin.com/Qpz5dn5Z (didn't wanna clutter the post up with it)

Note that some of this is subject to change, since it's a work in progress, but it likely won't change too much, I have everything worked out in my head and on paper pretty well.

I have specific lengths for the first three because I've basically finished them (besides some minor mixing changes that I keep tweaking), the rest are just ideas, nothing solidly arranged yet. 

**You can listen to a little demo/teaser of the transition between tracks 1 and 2 here:** https://soundcloud.com/needlessnoise/alive-2013-demo

If I work at the current rate, I estimate it'll be finished in about a month, shorter if I can really buckle down and finish it, in between projects of my own, work, family, etc.

Do we have enough musicians on here to jam out to Get Lucky?	milliondollarboy1	120	15	48	"For those unaware, /r/guitar holds what are called the ""Reddit Guitar Jams"" and they're through their 11th Jam. Here's how they work,

1. A thread is made in which the community decides on a backing track. (But in /r/DaftPunk's case, we would skip this step and go with a loop of Get Lucky.)

2. People record a guitar solo that will fit to the song, given a certain amount time to fill. (Usually 8 to 16 measures, or a whole verse or chorus if you're good.)

3. People submit their solos to a submission thread before the end date. All submitters post two audio files, one with the backing track for reference, and one without for mixing.

4. Someone mixes all the submissions into one long song. They have come out [rather nicely](https://soundcloud.com/charlatanalley/reddit-guitar-jam-10).

So is there any interest at all for doing this in /r/daftpunk? What do you guys feel about this? 

Edit: Ok, there seems to be interest. I'll get started! The first thread will be to discuss the music theory behind Get Lucky, how to record, answer questions, and to post an mp3 of a 16 measure sample. I'm hoping this project will be finished before the album drops!"	t5_2qtn5	True

1365968843.0	1ccbhr	Why Daft Punk Are Going Forward into the Past	impboy	114	10	15	"Something to keep in mind about the stated goals of this LP:

First off, I once plied my trade as a national music journalist, covering what once was known as ""electronica"" and now referred to as EDM. I came up during the first big bump of recognition in the late '90s, right around the time Madonna signed the Prodigy for $5 million, and the Chemical Brothers made everyone scrounge around for a Big Beat act. Daft Punk at that point were seen as these super-precocious prodigies with an amazing LP and a few hit singles to their credit. There was buzz and hype surrounding them from the very beginning of their come-up, but nothing like you see it now.

I was lucky enough to do an in-person interview with them in '97 before their Alive '97 show in NYC, and later, a phoner with Guy-Man after Discovery in '01. And even then, those guys were pretty much old-schoolers, rifling through past inspiration for guidance. One question I asked them in particular that didn't get published speaks to this: I was a raver at the time in Baltimore, and I asked them who would play at the party fo their dreams. And Thomas said that it wasn't so much about what party they would throw as it was about having a time machine where they could go back and listen to all of the bands they loved that are no longer together. Straight from the jump, they've been interested in everything and anything that was pop-music oriented. I mean, listen to ""Teachers."" Daft Punk has always been about doing their homework. If you'll allow me to extend the metaphor, they've just added on to their courseload as time has progressed and their skills have sharpened.

So a lot of what they said in that RS interview makes real sense to me, even moreso than when their collaborators were talking about it in the CP videos. What particularly stands out is them bemoaning the fact that most EDM is made now by DJs, in hotel rooms and airplanes. I'd also add that if any outside collaborators are pulled in, it's usually other DJs/producers in the same genre. It's almost always never other musicians. This makes for an extremely insular musical style that as they mention in the article, doesn't budge an inch, since no one can see a means of integrating other musical ideas into the mix. (except for that Re:Generation project, but that was by and large a corporate branding exercise that really doesn't have EDM's best interests at heart, ultimately. But that's another story.)

If change is gonna come, it's not going to be Scion or Red Bull that leads the charge, but the artists themselves. So I'm hoping that the new LP lives up to the hype. If EDM is truly here to stay, it will have to start reaching across the aisle and seeing all the lessons of musical innovation as part of their toolkit: session musicians, pro studios that have been abandoned for newer gear, etc. The logic here is that if you make your music differently than other producers, then it can't help but possess something those tracks just can't, even if it's a decidedly retro approach familiar to any Black Keys-style revivalist. The fact is it's new to EDM kids who think this music can only be made one way, and can only sound like every other track on the Beatport Top 10. Marshall McLuhan once said we always drive into the future using our rear-view mirrors. I think that makes a lot of sense for Daft Punk.

People like Moby have been crying out for years for the old-school producers to abandon the formulas that DJs rely upon to do their job. I'm hoping that we're on the verge of seeing this finally happen. If Daft Punk can do this, then RAM will definitely be worth the hype.

1368815615.0	1ej6ft	Because of RAM's popularity on vinyl, I've seen a lot of people asking for help on turntables and audio equipment. So here's a basic introduction to help you get started.	ryandinho14	115	11	31	"On every single post involving vinyl or a turntable I see someone asking for help with choosing a turntable and what equipment they need to go with it. Even on completely unrelated posts, the discussions frequently end up turning to vinyl and naturally someone asking for help. 

So you want a turntable huh? Welcome to the world of vinyl, where every sound is captured in its purest form and you can transcend into a previously undiscovered dimension of high-fidelity. There's a few things you need to take into account when shopping for a record player:

* Obviously, your budget.

* Your high-fidelity listening experience and on what equipment.

* Your supporting equipment such as speakers/headphones, amplifier, preamplifier, stylus, and even cables when you get into high quality equipment.

When shopping for musical equipment, always start from the bottom up. If you let someone else do all the research for you, you will end up buying very expensive equipment you don't need/won't understand/won't be able to appreciate. My father blasted thousands of dollars on hi-fi receivers, speakers, subs, and more based entirely off of what the assholes at Best Buy told him, but he has no idea how any of it works and he has it set up so that the sound quality is of speakers one-tenth the price. 

Your listening experience is what should really determine how much you splurge. Switching from listening to mp3s with Beats/iPod earphones to vinyls and hi-fi speakers/headphones is a massive audio transition that your ears will have a long and hard time transitioning to. **Don't jump straight in to the deep side of the pool, because you will drown in the depth of the sound.** Also, and more importantly, an inexperienced listener won't have the ability to tell the difference between an entry-level turntable and a thousand-dollar feat of engineering. If you don't want to get overwhelmed and you don't want to waste your money, you need to start with entry-level equipment.

**Note that by ""entry-level"" I don't mean cheap or gimmicky**. I mean the first tier of the high-quality pyramid. The first step in a new world. Entry-level equipment can still be relatively expensive, but nothing to the dozens of thousands some golden-ear audiophiles shell out for the ultimate listening experience. This is where you need to look at your supporting equipment.

For supporting equipment, at the bare minimum I recommend starting with a basic stack of turntable, amplifier, and speakers/headphones. A turntable will be a serious upgrade to your audio experience, but what are you going to hook it up to? If you jam to an iHome or Skullcandy headphones that you bought at Walgreens, you would probably get more value physically eating the money you plan on buying a turntable with. You will not be getting vinyl-quality sound, so again, I say look into entry-level speakers or headphones if you don't have some already. A good pair of headphones will be cheaper than a full surround sound speaker set and subwoofer.As for amplifiers you essentially have two choices : solid-state and tube. I will talk more about this later.

I became an aspiring audiophile only a year ago, so my knowledge is limited. Most audiophiles are older men and women with the experience and money to recreate high-quality sound, so I am always pushing my equipment to get the maximum dollar-for-dollar value possible. Here is my progression of equipment:

* [**Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones**](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M30-Professional-Closed-back-Headphones/dp/B00007E7C8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462526&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ath+m30). They were $40 when I got them and they were the biggest single improvement in sound I ever made. I listened to them primarily through my laptop, and at first my ears could not process all the different sounds going on in the higher-quality tracks in my iTunes library. Hence my recommendation to ease into the hi-fi market.

* [**Onkyo TX-SR503**](http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-SR503-receiver-7-1-channel/dp/B0009MX4RA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368463037&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=onkyo+tx-sr503). This was my first amplifier and also doubled as the receiver for my home sound system. I found it cleared the sound slightly and at high volume keeps the sound clear, along with allowing to play the music at much higher volumes than a laptop, mp3 player, or built-in amplifier can when you just want to drown out your world in a bravado of highs and lows. Amplifiers are the most technical-heavy with a wide array of statistics which allow you to judge their quality, but the numbers side is my weakest side, so I encourage you to research on your own the stats like Ohms, Watts, etc.

* [**Audio-Technica ATH-M50**](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462653&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ath+m50). These are the workhorse of the Audiophile world. The most popular and most trusted headphone model, and in the opinion of very many, the best cans you can get under $200 or even more. Being only $60 more than the M30's, these are the cans I recommend starting off with. After six months with them I'm still learning to fully appreciate their depth of sound.


* [**Polk Audio RM 6750 5.1 Speaker Set + Subwoofer**](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Channel-Theater-Speaker/dp/B0002WTK4S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368812867&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=polk+audio+rm6750). For the price, these speakers are more than you can ask for. I’m a headphone freak, so I was extremely hesitant buying speakers because of concerns over clarity. Because of the bass-obsession gripping the music world these days, these speakers are tuned to carry heavy bass by default, as will most speakers on the market today. To compensate for this, I had to tune the treble on my Onkyo receiver to the highest possible setting. I was concerned the speakers would struggle at this setting, but the sound is beautiful and as close to studio-recording recreation as my ears can detect. As for the bass, it goes without saying the speakers and the subwoofer more than deliver. What many don’t understand and what I need to emphasize, however, is that **bass is not just thumping sounds**. Contrary to what Beats listeners believe, bass shouldn’t only manifest itself in the form of air being pumped through your body with no recognizable sound attached. The subwoofer delivers, allowing even the most inexperienced listeners to distinguish the low-lows from the high-lows. That is what you need to look for in a subwoofer!

* [**Audio-Technica AT-LP60 Turntable**](http://www.amazon.com/Technica-AT-LP60USB-Automatic-Driven-Turntable/dp/B002GYTPB8/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462884&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=at-lp60). Buying a record player was the best choice I ever made in improving my listening experience. Of course I'm biased, but I find that even priced at $80, the AT-LP60 is as good as it gets for any turntable under $200. My first record was a pristine copy of ""Bad"" by Michael Jackson. Hearing that record for the first time through those ATH-M50's was a turning point in my life. No longer was I content with 192kbps torrents. The crystal clarity; the thumping lows and chiming highs; the sheer bliss of hearing MJ's ""hee hees"" and ""shamonas"" as if he was in the room was fucking righteous. If your budget is over $200, I say upgrade to the [AT-LP120](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT-LP120-USB-Direct-Drive-Professional-Turntable/dp/B002S1CJ2Q/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368814459) or [Pro-Ject Debut Carbon](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ject-Debut-Carbon-Belt-drive-turntable/dp/B00856L1J0/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368814821&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=pro-ject+debut+iii). Starting with anything more expensive than that is overkill.

* [**Denon AVR-989**](http://www.amazon.com/Denon-AVR-989-805-Watt-Channel-Receiver/dp/B001CSBEKE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368463786&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=denon+avr-989). Just like the Onkyo, this is an audio/video receiver that also functions as my amplifier. I did not get this to improve sound quality (which it does although), I got this because it was donated to Goodwill by either a Saudi oil tycoon or an elderly citizen who was intimidated by it and it was selling for $40, so I wasn't turning down that opportunity. 

In addition to this, my dad bought a speaker set consisting of [this]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Center-Channel-Speaker/dp/B0018QROM2/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813688&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=polk+audio+tsi200), [this]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-TSi100-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B00192KF12/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813555&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=polk+audio+tsi100), [this]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-12-Inch-Powered-Subwoofer/dp/B000092TT0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813706&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=polk+audio+subwoofer), and two of [these]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-TSi400-Floorstanding-Speaker/dp/B0018QROHC/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813669&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=polk+audio+ts10). I listen to them every time I come home, but to be honest I don’t think I have enough experience to fully appreciate them yet – and they’re not even correctly set up.  All I can say is those speakers don't discriminate - just like the ATH-M50's every little nuance in a song is picked up. You hear everything.

Now back to amplifiers, as I promised I would discuss tube vs. solid-state. If you already have a home receiver and only need an amplifier to use with your turntable, I encourage you to look into a [tube amplifier](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_5?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=tube%20amplifier&amp;sprefix=tube+%2Celectronics%2C282&amp;rh=i%3Aelectronics%2Ck%3Atube%20amplifier). They look and sound incredible. Tube vs. solid state is a big debate in the audiophile community. Watt-for-watt, tube amplifiers are more expensive. So if you are looking at a tube amplifier and a solid-state amplifier that cost the same, the solid-state amplifier will have a much louder threshold. However, this can also depend on a headphone's impedance.  I find tube amps provide a more distinctive sound, particularly with singer's voices. Solid-state amplifiers run entirely off of circuits and motherboards, and cannot capture voice in the same way.  What I find to be a strong argument for tube amplifiers is that those who use them are 110% sure that they are better than solid state, but those who use solid state amps are always struggling to prove their case. In addition, modern tube amplifiers aren't pure in the sense that the sound is relayed through just glass tubes - they're also integrated with solid state parts. Personally I've only listened to tube amps at music stores so my experience is limited here. Hopefully this summer I'll be getting one.

After this there are all sorts of other improvements you can make to your listening experience such as purchasing custom styluses and cables, but trust me when I say that will be unnecessary for a little while. I recommend starting with a basic stack of turntable, amplifier, and speakers/headphones. My personal recommendation is the ATP-L60 or 120, ATH-M50 and/or Polk Audio RM 6750 set, and a solid tube amp or receiver. This is my recommendation mostly because I haven't tried a wide range of other equipment, except for headphones. I've tried a lot of those. If you are curious about other headphone options, here is a [beginner's guide to buying headphones](http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-buying-guide), and here is a [ridiculously in-depth review of 107 different headphone models](http://www.head-fi.org/t/433318/shootout-107-portable-headphones-reviewed-astrotec-as-100hd-as-200hd-added-12-02-12), along with a [chart](http://cdn.head-fi.org/a/aa/666x2697px-LL-aadb1360_Portableheadphoneschartljokerl.png) with the review statistics.

You can find out more about audiophile-quality equipment on blogs and forums such as [The Audiophiliac](http://news.cnet.com/audiophiliac/), [head-fi](http://www.head-fi.org/), and my personal favorite, [Innerfidelity](http://www.innerfidelity.com/). Also, check out /r/vinyl for advice on turntables and how to care for your vinyl records. I want you to remember though that all these sites are frequented by experienced audiophiles, so make sure to emphasize you only need entry-level equipment or they will direct you to some crazy shit.

I think this is enough to get you started and hopefully I've spawned the quest of an aspiring audiophile! High-fidelity sound can change your life. It can heighten your senses and reshape the way you view the world - I know it definitely has for me. If you have any other questions you can of course message me, but I recommend posting on those forums where audiophiles with 40+ years of listening experience and a vast wealth of technical knowledge are always looking to help new listeners like us.

[Alternative Live](http://tunein.com/radio/BBC-Radio-1-England-988-s24939/) thanks to /u/theeaglesfan005

I'll try to transcribe the interview or at least some main points when its aired to try and find a link once its finished that will work around the world.

**10.16 GMT** Its over - Zane Lowe will be playing some tracks and chatting to them more later in the week. Extended interview to be posted on R1 youtube page.

**10.13 GMT** They seem to be hinting at a new style of music video. Moving away from traditional visuals towards shorter 1min style pieces. **They are also working on DP mixes of DP. Possibly what was playing in the background.** [~~Possibly heard at 6.51?~~](https://soundcloud.com/notpt/daft-punk-interviewed-by-pete) (Direct Radio Rip thanks to /u/aru3d) Actually a TC bootleg remix, my fault!

**10.10 GMT:** They had get lucky created before Nile came along - Nile was added after. Its been created over the past 2.5 years and they have been slowly been added and edit over the years.

**10.09 GMT:** As quite a few [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1e37h7/daft_punk_pete_tong_interview_thread/c9wdq7t) have noticed, get lucky was being repeated in a short repetitive loop then lead into a almost trap style remix of the chorus.

**10.06 GMT:** Pete Tong (PT) has heard the album - gave him goosebumps. Says its sounds like a homage to their childhood in the 70s. Talking about how house came out of the collapse of disco. 

**10.05 GMT:** DP say they fell RAM is their first studio album in some sense... they wanted to see where they could go next and experiment - this takes time.

**10.03 GMT:** ITS STARTING!

**9.57 GMT:** Time for the interview is now **10.05pm** [Tweet Link](https://twitter.com/petetong/status/332962455867232257)

**9.43pm GMT:** Few daft punk related shout outs, starting the hype. 

**9.06pm GMT:** Interview just been announced to be played just after 10pm GMT



**Some previous Info Pete mentioned whilst on Annie Mac's show:** 

* Daft Punk actually contacted him to organise the interview rather than the other way round.

* He went out and met Daft Punk at Coachella then went back to guy-man's house(?) to do the interview. He also noted that he didn't recognise guy-manuel under his bushy beard. 

* Also mentioned that he was originally only allotted 40 mins (?) for the interview but they ended up talking for over an hour and a half. He also said that a longer interview will be online with possibly more be released next week.

This Saturday, those two trends align.

By the weekend, it will have been three weeks since the ""Get Lucky"" ad and five days since the second collaborator video. Why would Columbia release the first video on such a weird day (Wednesday) if they weren't trying to line up the third one with SNL on Saturday?

Once again, this is speculation on my part, but I think we've got something to be excited for this weekend.

I was wrong.

Some of you who browse the big rumor thread of The Daft Club Forums may already know about this.

A music promo guy who is running a promo campaign in Estonia has posted to the forums about a HUGE promotional thing happening this weekend.

He said it is happening in a certain country, but did not state which.

That is all I know.

EDIT!!!!

This video has been linked to me in the comments below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRenyEX09zQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

I also forgot to mention that my source said that the event would happen in front of the world's eyes. 

Could it really be Monaco or the Indy 500?? :D

EDIT 2!!

Another video showed up on Youtube titled ""#4"" that showed Thomas and Guy on security cam footage walking across an empty room. The video was very quickly made private.

EDIT 3 

MORE VIDEO!!
