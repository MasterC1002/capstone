To newer listeners, he was an annoying show presence with an unwarranted superiority complex.

Anyone else feel this way?

As for the friends of the show, Vos, Burr, Patrice, etc.  Their routines invoke plenty of laughs, but sadly I can't say the same for Jimmy.

1376362072.0	1k93sb	For anyone coming to this subreddit group to learn about the show and to bash viewers, couple 'a things:	clarkiswhite	95	21	35	"1: Said homeless man hadn't just received money and compensation for the cake he fished out, he had BECOME a character on the show by being consistently there on their route, and when you become a character on their show, you've now entered the SOCIALLY LEVEL﻿ PLAYING FIELD of ""bashing"" any of their characters get on a daily basis; Erock their producer bashed for weight and laziness, Kenny their security for being weird and not eating vegetables, Sam (another producer) for being a brown nose and maintaining poor search engine skills, etc. He's just as eligible, regardless of social stature.

2: the show itself has a genuine love and/or fascination of homeless people and homeless life in general, spanning years of their﻿ on-air broadcasting. Besides their homeless shopping sprees in high-end malls(with the given homeless members KEEPING what they find), they've elevated other homeless people to sub-internet stardom; for example a man named ""Homeless Mustard"" covered Radiohead's ""Creep"", and the video itself reached OVER 12 MILLION views(besides being shared on the web's major outlets)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXlzci1rKNM

This is why context is important, folks. YES it looks horrific. And YES: Opie did instantly regret the decision.﻿ AND YES the man received a 100 from Opie(plus what he made from listeners which is why he parked himself out there every morning), which doesn't excuse the shittyness. But before any outrage, you need THOUGHT based on FACT, otherwise it just becomes blind, knee-jerk, reactionary nonsense.

1353018327.0	139ipt	Hi, I just listened to Opie and Anthony for the first time. 	sleeper141	75	9	107	"I got tired of stern and thought I would change it up. Been thinking about  listening and finally checked it out.

Fantastic. From pan flutes to astronomy to ripping on apple to heavy, heavy sarcasm at the world around them. Savannah cats, football without to much depth, making fun of Don Lemon, making fun of a fake prank phone call from a horse shit morning zoo show. 

Entertaining from start to finish. there were very few moments where i didn't know what was going on, no inside jokes, no references to old shows. it was in the moment and interesting. 

there's some sort of jingle contest? whatever, most of them were still interesting. never skipped  a thing. ""The men who built america"" discussion was great! It was nice to hear a conservative view point, without it being totally tea party crazy or full of shit. kind of like Adam Carolla. 

I'm not gonna sit here and mention Stern, these are 2 completely different shows with similar medium. I will say I found myself not wanting to skip, and not thinking ""oh this again"". Fresh. New. Interesting. 

I'm hooked and i'm not even finished listening. Why the fuck did I wait so long?

I said it before (as many ppl did) the last time this shit went down. **DON'T POST LINKS!!**  People told me to basically ""chill out, fuck off, opie took care of it, bla bla bla"" 

Look I get that we're all fans but we're losing ground here with all these uploaders being shut down.




I suggest we STOP posting links all together in Link Posts, Text Posts, and Comments. 


**REGARDING PM'S**
I also get that we think PM's are safer but in the TOAE thread alone I found 4 users who's accounts were 17hours old or newer.

* [da_disco_dog](http://www.reddit.com/user/da_disco_dog)


Honestly, there's a fair chance they're just lurkers who mad an account to ask for PM's but given that we know SXM could be using reddit to find uploaders, can we be more observant when PMing.  

If you guys are all real fans I'm sorry but you have to understand the suspicion.  

THANKS ALL

It's like I said, I feel bad if you're a genuine fan who just lurks and wants a link now, but it's really not worth my time to vet that out.  These accounts are all BRAND NEW.  There's no posts on them other than comments asking for PM's or comments bitching about me.  No karma, past posts to /r/opieandanthony or any other reddit, no history AT ALL.  Your account is essentially a throw away so don't be so pissed, and just make a new one (and actually contribute) or go back to lurking.

**EDIT 5: At this point I'm pretty sure ppl are making throw aways as a joke lol**

1370783582.0	1fz9tr	LFTC Party Recap	jackbowen	63	9	40	"So I stayed up all goddamn night. LFTC is still on, because no one knew how to shut it off after Ant went to bed. I will do my best to recap everything. 

Started with Karaoke, Danny... Melissa Stetten's Mom (yet to be 100% confirmed but that was what people were saying) Anthony, Carlton (black guy, he'll come up later) and Big A took turns singing songs. 

Then Ant went into the studio with a blonde girl, dont know the names of these people, this is just a vague outline. Anthony's total camera time was about 7 minutes. Jimmy left before the camera turned on (got a flat tire on the way home) as did Erock. Roland stuck around, saw him pass by the camera but that was it... he left shortly after the karaoke started. 

As ant was in the studio behind the desk, he got a call from the police... noise complaint from a neighbor. This is the last we see of Ant. Somewhere before he left to talk to the police, Danny stepped in.

Danny was verbally raped by almost every caller for about two hours. He did not take it well. Everyone took turns calling in, one after the other... making fun of him and the sad part was his girlfriend was sitting right next to him. He became defensive, an asshole to every caller and just an overall douchebag. His opening line the last hour is ""well, what do you do for work,"" followed by ""I work at rockstar"" ""I didn't want to work at O and A anymore..."" and he and Opie got into an argument supposedly at Patrice's memorial. From the little he said it had something to do with him feeling that Opie didn't have his back, I could be wrong here but thats what I think he alluded to. Overall he came across like a whining little girl, and made an ass of himself in front of his girlfriend and they both stormed off.

Then Wendy comes in, redhead @wendyJlake and Big A. She was drunk, and playful. Everyone took turns calling in and trying to get her to do stuff. We saw her ass... 


exhibit a: http://i.imgur.com/usrhWq9.png

I realize that isnt Big A, I think his name was Fred. Who these people are I really don't know. Big A slapped her ass, I think a gif of that was already posted in this subreddit. I asked her if she squirted, the answer was sometimes. I also asked if Jimmy would like her vagina... is it meaty, unfortunately the answer was no. We also found out such things as, she's not into bukkake's, she likes it doggy style, she is shaved, the curtains match the carpet... although its shaved. No anal. She wasn't wearing any panties... then she had to pee. I happened to be on the phone with her at the time, and told her just to pee in a cup... no go. Let me back up a bit, about ten minutes before this, Carlton... the black guy from karaoke weaseled his way into the studio and put his fingers in her. Then he disappeared. Wendy said that Carlton was eating her out, but since we didnt see him go down there, and the desk was in front I though she was full of shit. (She started to get cunty and less playful as time went on) Well she got up to pee... and then Carlton popped his black head up, whiped his mouth and sat down. 

I don't know how happy Anthony will be that there was interracial shannanigans going on in his studio... and on his chairs (you know how he gets with boogers let alone pussy juice) So as of right now Ant doesnt know this I don't think. Kinda funny. 

Anyways, so Carlton got up sat down with Fred and talked for a couple hours taking calls. Carlton didn't know how to talk into a mic so you could barely hear him.   Pretty boring... got to be around 4-5 am then these two other guys, I think they were interns or I dont even really know jumped in and took more calls (they took calls all night) So these two guys, one looked like a limp dick baldy pederast, which he was reminded by many callers, and the other had a sleeveless grey tshirt... he was a nice guy. 

Then around shit, like 7 AM this guy named Joe stumbled in from the pool, I guess he had passed out there. He had a ""puke bucket"" in his car just for the occasion, and used that before walking into the studio. His nose was very runny, he explicitly said it was not from cocaine. He plugged the site @devincomedy but we called him Joe, so I really don't know whats going on there. He kind of livened things up a bit, took some calls... gave advice on stand up.. all the while looking like he was going to puke at any second. 

It ended with Joe and the sleeveless grey shirt guy not knowing how to turn off the tricaster, so as I sit right now 8am central time, the feed is still running. I'm guessing sooner or later Ant will stumble down and turn it off, im leaving it on just in case. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post, it was a weird night at the compound... and was fun to watch the debauchery live all night. I don't know if he will keep the video up, because most of it was just kinda bullshit, with a few highlights, so it may be ""The Show That Never Happened II""

Also there's a rumor that Pat from Moonachie's girlfriend freaked the fuck out on the karaoke stage, and Anthony has a five minute video of it. I don't know the details of it, but something tells me it will be brought up on Monday.

**TL;DR weird night at the compound, saw anthony for about 5 minutes, the show is still going now at 8am as I type this, I believe it started around 10 last night, don't now when it will be shut off**"	t5_2se0w	True

&gt;Yesterday I received quite an unsettling youtube message from someone claiming to be a laywer for SiriusXm. The jist of the message was take down all O&amp;A related content, yadda yadda. I googled the name and, indeed, this person is a laywer. So I took it upon myself to call this person this youtuber claimed to be to make sure. Indeed this is the real deal, folks. The VERY nice lady told me SiriusXM is cracking down on us uploaders and that I am not the first, nor the last, she will be contacting (but not so ominously).

&gt;As a result, ALL the hulkshare and sharebeast link have been taken down and disabled by those websites' owners. I thought maybe it was some sort of scare tactic by the haters, but like I said, this is/was for real. 

&gt;SO, my friendly friends, I think another O&amp;A torch must be extinguished. You know I love you all and wouldn't abandon you unless I felt this was legitimate. I will be taking down all the FULL SHOW links, as they are somewhat useless at the moment heh. As for the show clips, those must unfortunately be taken down as well :(

&gt;I only ever wanted to spread the JOY that is the O&amp;A show, but I guess that just isn't in the cards anymore. Youtube may have seen the last of the Show, my friends. It's only a matter of time before they come a-knockin on your youtube door! Until then, have a wonderful life and thank you for forever and a day for being the best!

This really sucks. It's one thing to take down full show uploads from new episodes but old shows and archives? This is how O&amp;A get promoted and make people support the show.

I think if we all contacted Opie, Anthony and Erock on Twitter they might be able to do something about this. What do you guys think?

Edit: I messaged Erock about this, asking if there's anything they can do about it, and he replied: ""Nada. They own it. You'll have to pay for it like everyone else."""	t5_2se0w	True

Allright I think the stream I have is live. So, as long as this stream doesn't take a huge shit, I will try to continue GT&amp;J's daily recordings at:

http://gregorioantonioyimmy.blogspot.ca/

Note there is also a live mobile version.

Basically will be taking over for as long as I can, and will be posting around 11:00 am Est each day.

I am an audio engineer and very familiar with MP3's, quality and tech. 

I'm not awake early enough to hear the show live. so I won't have those totally amazing show recaps that GTAJ was providing for us, as I am automating the recordings, I hear them pretty much when you do. 

Please allow me to practice this for this week, I will use Hulkshare as well, and it's not very reliable. 

http://www.hulkshare.com/GregorioAntonioYimmy

That is all. Thanks @GTAJ for being awesome and for the past year of awesome listening! 

If you have any suggestions, or if someone else has already taken over and I don't know about it please send me an email at:

&gt;Well Steve was busy working on FoundryMusic all day and not paying attention to the show. That's kind of a big deal when you're the EP for a talk show.

Po once ""lost"" girls ID's on purpose and then magically ""found"" them so he could drive to DC and return them in person. Every last person I had a beef with was well deserved and what you hear on the air is maybe 1% of what you actually know.   
          
&gt; My god there's tons. Once Op wanted Sirius to ""get their shit together"" and do another Animation festival. Mind you this was his idea in the first place. Price it out, find a venue, get a budget together and then this dude actually has the balls to demand an APPEARANCE FEE to his own shows event!! Are you reading this properly? The millionaire wanted to be paid to go to his own party. So what happened you ask? Well there was never a second Animation Festival. That's from the workhorse of Satellite Radio, who btw wants to be Stern so hard he demanded a 4 day workweek for himself. Not the show, just for him. This is also the same guy that leaves his own show at the stroke of 10 regardless of whats going on. Dude just packs up and abandons his own fucking show. And by the way, if it ever gets mentioned again, watch him say something about the ""skill sets"" of management.

* Show has started. Opie is finally all in with Zimmerman's trial. Rachel Jeantel is sassy
* Poor sweet little Jeantel is thoroughly bashed. Neck pillow
* Jeantel looks like Patrice as a tranny
* She's nowhere to be found on today's paper because she's a retard who's fucking up the prosecution's case
* The news blips ""cracker"" and ""nigger"", Jim sighs
* ""Creepy ass cracker""
* The news bleeps ""cracker"" and ""nigger"" because Trayvon said it. When Zimmerman supposedly said ""fucking coons"", it was played over and over again. Good point Jimmy. [He tweets that, in realtime](https://twitter.com/JimNorton/status/350200448503922689)
* Poor Jeantel get's mad during her testimony. Jim is consumed with rage for the press
* Internet, don't make the same mistakes of the media. Don't pixelate nipples
* They sing a song to Sydney, the intern
* They review twitter posts about precious Jeantel
* **SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION, I HAD TO TAKE A DUMP**
* They are taking a call from a lawyer. He says that this comodo dragon Jeantel will be prep to show sadness today, because it's a fine line between that and rage
* They start Aaron Hernandez talk, but are going to brake any moment
* Now they seem to be all in with this. Rumors and news reports are being discussed
* It was premeditated murder, Sam! Cotton candy gum makes it so
* DOMA's decision by the Supreme Court means more weddings to attend. Jim is happy about the decision
* Sam knows all the gay bars, for some reason. Jim wants a kiss-off with him
* **FIRST BREAK** - Jennifer Hutt calls in next. Today Colin will be in (they haven't mentioned it yet, but he [confirmed yesterday on twitter] (https://twitter.com/iamcolinquinn/status/349976795543638016))

* **Colin Quinn** is in studio
* Jenny Hut phone call (who's this bitch? She's from the media, from Dr. Drew, they say). She looks very good on TV. She lasered her ass-hair
* She tries to defend Jeantel and the prosecution's case. Chip thinks Jeantel looked zooted
* Ant gives Jenny a lesson on the legal matters of the case. Even with her account of the events, it wouldn't be murder
* Oh poor Jenny, she still thinks the Police told Zimmerman to stop the pursuit
* ""Jenny, you and the rest of the media have a lot of responsibility if riots start after Zimmerman's acquittal""
* Jenny seems to be unable to counter any of the boy's points and want's to get out of the phone. Now they talk about Paula Deen, Jenny thinks she doesn't like the blacks a lot
* Jenny denies ever using the nigger-word. Phone call is ended
* **They watch this video, what a savage, what a fucking animal**:

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dvvHMM6TF50

* There was a 3 year old child on that room. This guy is still on the loose
* Colin points out that Jim said ""there was no need for that"". Bravo Jim
* Paula Deen's Matt Lauer interview is dissected. ""Are you a racist?"" - Watch out for Matt Lauer!
* Paula Deen's accent is the perfect racist accent
* Colin does an impression of Deen's black employers for some reason
* ""Never be honest about race"" - that's the lesson
* Colin looked like John Holmes 30 years ago. Hopefully he'll end up like him
* Matt Lauer is a sneaky bastard. Tries to undermine Paula Deen's gun point robbery story. ""Shut up, Oh my God! A grown man saying n-word, what a fucking country of pussies""
* Anthony says everyone thinks about the word ""nigger""
* Colin throws out a quote: ""C'mon folks, it's comedy: somebody's gonna get hurt""
* Paula Deen doesn't participate in young niggas conversations. It's very distressing for her to know that young people say ""nigger"" all the time. Poor woman, my heart is broken for her. Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck? Well, they keep playing the clip lol
* Discussion about white guilt in general. Opie thinks this will take time to change. Brilliant observation
* Chris Hansen new show should be ""To catch a racist""
* **Bert Marcus and Penhouse girls** next
* **SECOND BREAK**

* Bert Marcus in studio to discuss his documentary ""How to Make Money Selling Drugs""
* Colin: ""let's not act like 50 Cent is Henry Ford""
* Discussion about drugs. Not much to report... it's interesting I guess
* They talk about boxing and stuff... I'm not really liking this interview too much
* More documentary talk, plugs and:
* **THIRD BREAK**
* Colin is changing is entire schedule just to be on when Lady Di and Marion return to the show
* They remember when Lady Di and Marion went to the VMAs
* They return to sweet Jeantel, who's testifying again. Opie was right, she can't read (how she could text Trayvon Martin escapes me, then)
* **Bill Burr** is on the phone! They discuss how sweet and beautiful Jeantel is really Patrice in drag
* Bill Burr starring with A-listers makes Jim physically ill. The new movie he's in, ""The Heat"", comes out tomorrow, but don't blink during it, or you'll miss him
* Hernandez talk with Burr
* Big laughs are had because Colin makes fun of Bill. Bill reminds Colin of the Crocodile Dundy episode
* They all agree how the show has made everyone jaded and fondly remember horrific bits from the good old days
* Now Ant tries to discuss the Zimmerman trial with Burr. The others stay silent and Burr almost falls for it but quickly ends the discussion. Ant's obsession is amazing 
* Bill loves Chip. Bye bye Bill
* **Penthouse girls** are in and they're already showing tits. ""Nice figures on these gals"". They're Polish, but Opie confuses that with Russian
* ""Russian? What are you? In a hurry? Tss tsss""
* These girls are good eggs. They ""lez out""
* The two sisters can't touch each other on film because it's illegal
* They start spanking each other, or was it Chip? I didn't catch that... Multiple Oh My God's can be heard
* Fuck, I barely can keep up with this... too many things happening right now. Chip takes the sexy out of the room time and time again
* Have you both sucked a penis together? -Yes. Is it weird for you? -No, not at all
* Jim touches boobs. Chip continues to bomb. Anthony loves their pussy, what a man!
* Roland is said to want a lap dance, but apparently he's in hiding, he went to get a pic with Miley Cyrus instead
* There's the possibility for everyone to take a pic with Miley Cyrus, only Jim seems interested, but doesn't go because he already has one
* Roland is offered a lap dance again, but wants Hannah Montana instead... he's a real Mo
* These girls like beer, tequila shots and vodka. They talk really dirty on polish
* Plugs for the girls. They are on the cover of Penthouse and will be at Head Quarters (?) tonight, wherever that is
* Chip ruins the mood again. Ant needs to go to the dentist, but first he and Colin do some Russian accents, the broads are liking that - ""this is funny shit"". ""It's a comedy of errors in here"", says Chip
* Plugs for Colin. Ant really needs to go. They spot Miley Cyrus and the **SHOW IS OVER**

I'll include staff tweets, photos and anything else applicable. See you all later. Should be a good show!

~~Sirius XM is looping a ""Please stand by..."" error message, meaning there's probably issues getting the broadcast working from Canada. I'm sure it will be okay before 7am.~~

*Fixed: The channel is broadcasting again.*

-----

Okay, and we're off with *Ecstasy of Gold*, a different version than the usual one...


**First Break**

- POV of the audience from @OpieRadio: https://twitter.com/OpieRadio/status/360354364445032449
- Jimmy did a gig last night, the usual comic friends will be stopping by throughout the day.
- The Radio Wizard is introduced to the audience. They don't respect him already. The boys and staff talk about their traveling to Montreal, and how Gary forgot his passport.
- Roland's flight seat and hotel room were sold, he posted an Instagram video of the noise outside his closet room: http://instagram.com/p/cK-f6nNbRa/
- Erock is introduced to the audience. He's fat but not *that* fat. They talk about his night briefly. Roland walks in with food. His plane and room woes are discussed. Jimmy farted on the plane.
- Photo from audience member @DalexMTL of the boys broadcasting: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360358727037112320
- *Joe DeRosa* joins the show, I'm sure everyone's pleased with that. His tattoo still sucks, people noticed.
- Americans don't understand Celsius or kilometres. I don't know why, that's the better and logical system.
- Anthony brings up guns and how Canada has the crime thing sorted. He'd rather have his guns.
- Canadian cops have nothing to do apparently so they harassed Joe on his way up to the festival.
- The terrorist group FLQ is brought up after a listener request, presumably to upset the Canadians.
- Roland is brought up again because Anthony can't get over his hotel room being sold. Erock stories...
- Erock was trolling for ""big clits"" last night in-between watching The Simpsons in French (https://vine.co/v/hK099pYLnY1), tonight's plans and last night are discussed.
- Jimmy bombed, Travis says Sal back in New York will find it; he speaks over ISDN and disappoints Opie. 
- Bobby is setting up his show in the lobby. He's trashed. Joe says Bobby shouted at him last night.
- Denny is needy and chimes in via the ISDN line, his broadcasting expertise is mined. Joe wants to fuck the interns, Denny suggests he takes them out to breakfast. He takes a shot at Joe's tattoo.

-----

**Second Break**

- We're back. Joe is still in studio. Three audience members took photos with Anthony. The Radio Wizard told the audience they couldn't record the show. Opie, Ant and Jim are perplexed by this.
- *Jesse Joyce* (@jessejoyce) is in studio. He was banned from Canada for a while because of a DUI.
- He was pulled over by the cops and some black fellows turned on him. As riveting as this was, Jimmy notices pretty audience members and they want to talk to them more.
- *Colin Quinn* shouted inside the studio, doesn't appear to have stopped by just yet. The boys ask a pretty audience member to do some yoga. They quiz her relationship.
- This women's boyfriend is a dud and they're letting her know it. Apparently he's an artist she enjoys sex.
- *Tom Papa* is in studio, he informs us Colin is busy writing today so he'll be on tomorrow. Tom tells us about flying with Roland.
- Flight shenanigans: Colin trampled Jim's sleeping pillow, Amy put Colin's bag at the back of the plane, Jimmy shit before the pilot used the bathroom and Amy wore horrendous shoes (https://twitter.com/JimNorton/status/360072438756802561). 
- A couple from the audience is quizzed about their relationship, marriage and divorce is brought up.
- Breaking news: Jimmy is buying doughnuts for the audience, what a sweet boy. Bob Kelly is up next, see you in a few minutes.

-----

**Third Break**

- Hi everyone! Break over. *Bobby Kelly* is on his way. Some comedian called Chris is in studio, I missed his last name. Ooops. Bobby is here! Deeeewwwwwwdddddd!
- With all of the comics in, there'll probably just be a lot of trashing with very few things to update about. Recap: Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, Joe, Bobby and Chris are in studio.
- Jimmy's crowd doughnuts have arrived, cementing his award for Boy Most Likely To Buy Doughnuts he received in high school.
- *Kurt Metzger* joins the fun and festivities, Anthony notes the couch is full and Joe will have to forfeit his position should a better comic need it.
- Bobby Kelly scratched his cornea, he's trashed for being so clumsy and not remembering how this happened. Tom Papa talks about his recent acting roles. 
- Lots and lots of photos of the event are being posted via The Opie &amp; Anthony Channel Facebook page, here's some of them:
https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/61392_10151718988880762_264034644_n.jpg

https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1006297_10151718970350762_936616988_n.jpg

https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151718785495762.1073741830.8637380761&amp;type=3
- Travis' daughter, Riley, is at the show and cackled over the microphone. Uncle Paul is a fan.
- Bailey Jay is brought up, Joe admits he would suck her dick and lick her asshole. It's pointed out that Riley is still close by. Travis doesn't care. British Jimmy makes an appearance.
- Extended Bailey Jay, dick sucking and cum eating talk. Jimmy has cum stories. Wonderful times.
- Transgendered women talk abruptly turns into Bobby-could-loose-an-eye talk. Joe takes the reins, the show moves onto post-op vagina talk. Jimmy has stories, naturally. Opie has photos.
- Opie brings up that The Dirty has released new Anthony Weiner dick photos, go Google it if you wanna see.
- There's no After Show today, but there will be a Warmup Show tomorrow if you're into that.

-----

**Fourth Break**

- We are back. Tom Papa is out, John Mulaney is in. He hasn't been on the show before, Jimmy wanted him.
- This is the last break for today. Bobby is drooling over John. Why have I never heard of him?
- More crowd work, there's a terrorist in the audience according to Anthony. Apparently Anthony likes younger women, who knew? 
- Nice panoramic photo from the back of the audience of the broadcasting room via @elleswhere: https://twitter.com/elleswhere/status/360405197849255936
- Anthony goes off at John for not getting a prenup, he's an ""asshole"", as he's currently three years into a relationship. Perhaps he's had experience? 
- Anthony says any lawyer could extort John for his SNL money; as his wife would have been ""instrumental"" in his carer. He talks about his own past and all the money he lost during his divorce.
- Joe's tattoo becomes the topic of conversation again. John is not a fan of it. ""KKTITN"" is ridiculed, as it should be. Can Joe ever catch a break? No.
- Joe is talking about cancer now, I don't know why. He's trying to divert attention from tattoo from saying he fucked up, but we know that won't stop the onslaught.
- Some new photos from The Opie &amp; Anthony Facebook page, enjoy:

- They are wrapping up and all deem the show a success. They thank Montreal and the crowd. Lots and lots of plugs. If you're at the festival, go see all the comics.

Jimmy: never

Opie: Even in the beginning like some people start out a little...

Jimmy: Some for like a drink or two i was charlie cheerie, but then by drink three i was dan dreary and by fucking drink five i was oscar obnoxious and by drink eight i was fucking STEVE SUICIDAL. 

You know what i didnt mean to say that name i meant to say sam but hes not here, yessss

Anthony: poor guy thats terrible jimmy

I think this is as close as a clue we are about to get, at least until they dont care about the subject anymore so 3 to 4 years

I was wondering why the O&amp;A subreddit doesn't have its own theme, has no-one offered to design it? I could create a dummy subreddit, design it and see what you all think of it.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

------------------

EDIT: The first version can be found here, the main ideas are implemented and I've taken on the suggestions in this thread. I'll come back later and see what else you want changing/adding...

http://www.reddit.com/r/gregghughesandtony/

Thanks!

----------------
----------------
EDIT EDIT:

Latest changes:

- margin added to footer so there's some space under the main content
- pattern added to the footer
- ""there doesn't seem to be anything here"" text amended to be more friendly/informative
- reduced padding on comments to take up less room
- border fixed around the topics to make it equal
- subreddit link repositioned 
- added padding to space elements out more
- popular quote added to footer (i love the :after/:before pseudo class)
- links are now a pastal blue and not bold as opposed to black and bold (was hard to distinguish)
- blockquotes edited slightly (more padding and dark border color)
- question/exclamation alien changed to o&amp;a aliens
- opie &amp; anthony / sirius xm logo added to footer

to do:

- custom flairs (need to make some good icons first, if anyone can do this...
- someone said the links are in the middle of the comment section, im awaiting a screenshot to see...

Want anything else added/changed, tell me in the comments...

I think Howard doing AGT really did it as well. The radio show just doesn't feel special anymore. 

The relaxed, ball busting, guys hanging out feel of the O&amp;A show is just so much better than a 30 minute AGT commercial every morning. I used to have to listen to every bit of the Stern show, but now I find myself forgetting about it. 

I was more excited for Jocktober this month than any bit on the Stern show in the past couple years. Also, thanks to youtube, I have a wealth of old O&amp;A clips to keep me entertained for hours (I spent about 3 hours listening to Bobo clips last night, I fucking love that gullible idiot).

The outrage this has caused is definitely going to lead to an increase in subscribers to O&amp;A. And the boys can use this as an example of why letting them off of the leash could be huge for both the show and the company. These videos are years old...imagine if both of these were made last week.

I know Sirius' management is pretty much retarded, but Howard's absence from working regularly is eventually going to lead to a subscriber exodus. Anything they can do to soften the blow, especially O&amp;A being in the news for outrageous stuff like this on a regular, is going to help the company. Outrage is a major, and probably most fool proof tool to use in the media. Howard, Rush Limbaugh, South Park and even the Simpsons have used it to gain mass appeal. If they let the boys do what they want, it will lead to more subscribers and bigger numbers for the show (The Opster will once again put up some numbers).

Probably won't happen...because it's the logical thing to do. But if there anyone for O&amp;A to convince Sirius, it's right now. Hopefully this plays out that way. Troy keeping his job shows that management has been lightening up, even if it's only slightly."	t5_2se0w	True

The cake incident is a big part but there is another thing that is going on which is more inside than the Opie debacle. Because of the comments the cake thing brought, Balding Ross became very comfortable throwing insults than he was originally. I have a feeling that this is what may push Anthony and the Boys to finally give him the trashing he deserves. Danny stayed quiet about it besides the day Ant made the quick mention but I think he started to feel more comfortable when the public started to trounce. Maybe he thought they were going to be canned, maybe he just wanted to inject himself inti the whole (very difficult) situation, but he became a little too confident that Ant for some reason would stay quiet. So I hope break 1 takes care of all the fruits who started on reddit, but I hope break 2 takes care of this asshole. 

And after reading the stuff people posted here I know he reads this site so let's get this out of the way real quick. Danny, no I don't work at Rockstar, no I'm not in radio, no I don't have a glamorous job as a game tester or VO work. I do comment on a radio show I love at 1am and I am happy to do so.  No I wasn't privy to being best friends with Millionaire so I was never at the equivalent of a compound party, and yes you probably on paper have lived a more glamorous life than I have. But I would never, and this is 100% honest, want to be like you. If I had to act, think, or anything like you to experience what you have with OnA, I wouldn't do it. You may have a somewhat cool job now, had a great job then, but you as a person are a miserable waste whose brain I would never want to be trapped in. So criticize whatever you want about me, I know what you have done, what you do, and who you are and I am happy as shit I didn't live your life.

Today we'll learn how to record the show, daily, automatically, with no user intervention set-it-once-and-forget-about-it style, so we don't have to rely on online sources, because they will eventually fail sometimes. 

This method will ensure faster show availability for you, no matter what country you are! No more waiting for links to popup online. You'll have a fresh mp3 everyday waiting for you any time you want it.


This requires a live stream, so you might be asking, if you have a live stream, why do you need this? Well, because I work when the show is on, so fuck you. I need my mp3 everyday to listen when I can!




##Let's start, should we?  
*I'm doing all this using windows 8, but should work fine on older versions. Read everything very carefully, there's an hint in this tutorial* 
__________________________________________________________________
**Things needed:**


* A PC  
* Windows
* Radiosure
* PC has to be on when the show starts
* A functioning online stream for the OandA channel (you can find this using google, very easily, I won't spread the oanda stream, because I don't know if it's allowed) Also, I don't know if this works  with official Sirius XM stream, this is only tested using a freely available 24/7 Opie and Anthony Channel stream. Of course, if the stream fails, everything goes to shit, but I've never seen it fail before, so...

__________________________________________________________________

 


**1 -** Download and install **RadioSure** (free version) - http://www.radiosure.com/downloadz/  

**2 -** Add your OandA channel stream to radiosure (right click anywhere and select ""add new station"")  


**3 -** Check if your stream is working. Also, copy your stream URL, it will be needed later.

**4 -** Open radiosure settings (the wrench and hammer icon) and go to ""recording"". There select the output folder, bitrate (I have selected auto, no need to set it higher than 65kbps for speech), deselect everything else, except ""allow direct stream recording"".  


**5 -** Now, to schedule the recording of shows, every week day, from 6am to 10 am:

- 5.1 - Go to windows control panel and search for ""Schedule tasks""
- 5.2 - From the menu ""Action"", select ""Create task"", a new window will open.
- 5.3 - Give the task an easily identifiable name like ""Fuck you Sirius, I'm poor"", or something like that, and make the rest of the settings like this:

http://i.imgur.com/OlRjb.png

- 5.4 - On the next tab, ""Triggers"", we define our schedule time, like this (every week day starting at 6am (you can set it to start at 5:55 so not to miss a second):

http://i.imgur.com/9gV41.png

- 5.5 - On the ""Actions"" tab, we define what the computer should do, so we select, ""Start a program"". A new window will appear. Browse to your RadioSure.exe on the ""Program/script"" field.
Then, and this is essential, you must set ""Add arguments (optional)"", like this

    /record /source=""STREAM_URL_HERE_WITHOUT_QUOTES"" /mute /duration=255

- the **/record** tells radiosure to record a stream, the **/source** is our OandA channel stream url, something like mms:etcetc.com or anyother that you have set on radiosure on step 3, **/mute** ensures that the pc isn't playing the show while it's recording (of course, you can remove this if you want, and the **/duration** is the number of minutes to record (the show lasts 4 hours, so it's 240mins, I have set it to 255 for it not to miss anything)

Everything should look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/mA4az.png

- 5.6 - On the ""conditions"", make sure you select ""wake the computer to run this task"", in case you make the computer slepp at night. (on my specific pc, this doesn't work, the PC doesn't wake, because my motherboard is shitty in terms of power features. Please post if you have problems with this in the comments, because I've found a fix for me using another app.

Everything should look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/1R6C4.png


- 5.7 - On the ""settings"" tab, deselect everything, according to your needs. I have the first two options selected, but it doesn't really matter.

**6 -** Now that we have everything set up, you can test if the task will really record anything. To do that, go to the main Task Scheduler Library, right click your task and select ""run"". Let it run for a few seconds, radiosure should run by itself and in tray, it's icon will appear with a red bubble, indicating it's recording. Now, stop the task by right clicking it and select ""End"".
Go to your output folder, that you have set up in radiosure for recordings, there should be there an mp3 file with the recording you just made.


**Here's a manual run of the task, to see what the end result is**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxSWIt4Bt0


(notice at the beginning, there's no folder/files on the desktop but, after running the task, there's a nice mp3 file there). 

**7 -** That's it, every week day, starting at the time you have set (6am), radiosure will silently and automatically record your favorite show for you, so you'll have a fresh mp3 file everyday, no need for more fetching around online for a link!





FINAL WORDS: **PLEASE, share your recordings** on our subreddit, don't rely solely on other people, this way we'll have a pretty good redundancy system, so no day will pass that no one has a link for the show.

##-------------------------**06-28-2013 Opie And Anthony Show** --------------------------------------

* The Ecstasy of Gold is playing... now the intros and stuff
* And we're on! It's **Lady Di, Marion and Bobo Day**
* They wanted Patti but maybe she's working, they hope she calls
* And now Aaron Hernandez. He may be involved in another double muder, 1 year ago, which makes him a serial killer

---------------- *PATTI's PHONE CALL* -----------------------


* **Patti** phones in! She has just woke up, right after being asleep. She answers post cards. Something about cat cancer
* She has an appointment with the vet. They try to convince her to come by. She trashes Lady Di
* Patti can't make it, and just keeps talking over OandA. Now they're talking about her health. She had thyroid surgery and now pays 30 dollars a month
* Some ERock weight jokes. Patti still hasn't had a dick in her cooter, as expected. She also answers jokes. She's 58 now, fuck
* She still masturbates, thinking about Paul McCartney. Still wouldn't take his dick
* She likes museums and try out Apple products. Her work conditions are discussed and mocked
* They advise her to steal from the tips jar
* She has left 20 dollars at the end of the week for herself, after paying all bills. She's now paying off a DVD with those 20 dollars, it's a nice little personal pleasure. If she buys a coffee, it's 1/4 of her weekly budget gone
* More Patti's life arrangements discussion. ""Patti, you rule. We love you"" - aww...
* They remember old Patti bits
* All the superstar guests for today have arrived... They are in the summer camp office
* The boys compliment Patti's phoner. They love her
* Samples of Patti's mouse trap bit are played. Her screams resemble Trayvon's. Patrice and Burr were in that day... they all miss Patrice
* She describes all the cards she has on her wallet and then they'll let her go
* A caller does the math: it will take 50 years to pay off the thyroid surgery. Patti will be 108 by then
* She ""smack talks"" lady Di again. Phone call ends, the fans and the boys don't like her... they LOVE her!


---------------- *END OF PATTI's PHONE CALL*-----------------------


* Travis discusses the situation with Bobo, lady Di and Marion on the summer camp, ""there's so much idiocy out there. Roland is ready to kill herself, he has no patience. Jackie loves all of them, as do Travis and Sam
* ""Roland is fucking furious"", if he had a gun there would be a massacre today
* Jim isn't very excited about Bobo's appearance
* They speculate what all of them will say when they come in


##---------------------**FIRST BREAK** ------------------------------

* **NEWSFLASH** - The boys are off all of next week, the best of 2013 so far will be played all week long
* **Colin Quinn is in studio**
* Opie tweets a Lady Di video - http://instagram.com/p/bGeMh2LhYs/ --ooof...
* Colin and Bobo had a little chat on the back office

---------------- *LADY DI AND MARION* -----------------------


* ""Let's get retarded in here, Let's get retarded in here"" - **Lady Di and Marion are in studio**, what an entrance
* ""Welcome back ladies, what were you up for the last 7 years?""
* They are now discussing Marion's life. Both of them answer jokes
* Marion invites herself to Anthony's pool parties. He accepts. Lady Di is invited too
* Marion doesn't drink beer anymore. She gives her opinion on Lady Di's life
* Lady Di discusses the benefits of watching TV all day. **Stinky** stops by, screams can be heard from the girls, everyone on studio very emotional

* Lady Di gives a summary of what's on the news - ""James Gandolfili"" has passed away. She doesn't want to say the word Paula Deen used
* Her all life is being dissected
* Marion is defending her husband to someone on the phone (I don't know if it's a random caller or some comedian, I didn't catch that)

##---------------------**THE END** ------------------------------

**TLDR:** 

Today was the much anticipated **Marion and Lady Di** show, for which Colin changed is schedule just to be on. 


It uncluded appearances from Stalker Patti and Bob Levy on the phone, and Colin Quinn, Bobo, Ira and Dj Whoo Kid on the studio. 


For a nice change, no current events were talked about, the whole show was a tribute to these stars of OandA

And, although we all agree that no one can replace Patrice or will ever come close, it is good to see the black angle on the show; an angle that is not instinctually reactionary and calling everything racist which is what I think Sherrod brings with him. It gets tiresome listening Ant - although valid at times - bring everything to a race argument without an opposing point. Jim is fair on both sides of it, but that added view would be a great thing for the show. And above all else I think Sherrod is a funny dude, and brings with him stories about other comics and times down at the cellar and having worked on Tough Crowd which I never get tired of hearing. So if this subreddit does have some sort of ear at the show, which I'm sure they've already discussed anyway, Sherrod on the show regularly is a good move in my opinion. 	t5_2se0w	True

So when I discovered a show that was on 4 hours 5 times a week of nothing but ranting it was like finding the motherload of crack.

Anyways, the old episodes of the Monday Morning Podcast were my favorite things in the world. Bill is a heavy drinker, and would just rip people apart under his breath at an airport on his cellphone. Not that I don't like the new ones, just that these little 20~40 minute explosion of anger were my introduction to **real** dark comedy.

With my laptop being stolen in 2010 and the theMMPodcast server holding nothing older than 2011 as well as youtube clips only going back to about 2009, I thought I'd never listen to them again until I discovered an old harddrive in the back of my closet with all the early 'lost' episodes of the Monday Morning Podcast.

If anyone wants to instruct me on where to put these up I'll be happy to give it to you guys cause I'm sure I'm not the only one who listened to these.

In exchange if any of you guys can find the 'lost' episodes of the Uninformed Podcast (not the one on the website now, the ones that were on the G-Cast portion of there myspace page for a few years) I've also been wanting to listen to them for years.

Tl;dr Anyone up for some old fashioned file-sharing (*shurrrre*) of the early episodes of Bill Burr's Monday Morning Podcast?

P.S. I'm the fucking E-rock of podcasts

We need some people to volunteer to either email him or tweet him and explain what Reddit.com is and what a AMA is. Maybe show him links to Louis CK's and Aziz Ansari's AMA. If he saw that two guys he knows did them maybe he would consider it. 

It would be nice if he did it in the O&amp;A subreddit but I think it would reach more people if he did it in [/r/IAmA](/r/IAmA) 

Reach out to Norton after he tapes his special and lets convince him to do this!

**Pre-show with Sam Roberts**

*Start of broadcast*

- We're off with Sam Roberts. The pre-show was apparently last minute, the crowd is enthused as there is none: https://twitter.com/notsam/status/360700525433470976
- Quick recap of yesterday's show: the comedians were all great but Sam credits Joe's admission of wanting to suck dick as the show stealer.
- Erock is in studio. Troy says Joe is uninteresting so all he has is sucking dick talk. On air fight later?
- Sam breaks that Just for Laughs is a good place to see comedians. Sal talks over ISDN, the phones are up.
- In studio today: Colin Quinn, Marc Maron, Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa, Jimmy Carr (!), Chris DeStefano and Judah Friedlander. Good lineup.
- Caller wants to know if Travis' wife will be on the show. Reminder of yesterday when Riley laughed at Uncle Paul. Riley has never met Jimmy, but has met all of his characters. 
- Another caller, agrees with Troy and hates Joe. Sam says this is unfair without Joe in studio. Stupid, dumb Larry calls in; I hope the God he so vehemently believes in kills in him with a thunderbolt.
- Sam questions if Anthony will be here today 'cos of last night: drinking, casino, etc. Audience coming in.
- Keith the Cop is in studio, he doesn't like the Shit Show. Says Anthony will have some good material.
- Opie &amp; Anthony shows don't attract many girls. Sam found one. She's not a fan, her boyfriend is.
- New photos of yesterday are being uploaded to The Opie &amp; Anthony Facebook page: https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/74616_10151720572415762_1358038939_n.jpg https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/521634_10151720572665762_89687033_n.jpg https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1000873_10151720572745762_619514549_n.jpg https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1003317_10151720572440762_1585169145_n.jpg
- Sam works the audience as more and more people turn up. Photo from @DalexMTL showing Sam broadcasting: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360709619435319296
- We've found a female Opie &amp; Anthony fan. Who is she? Where did she come from? Why is she Canadian?
- Another photo from @DalexMTL showing Troy going around the audience: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360711113194745857
- Bathroom troubles with Roland and Erock last night. Roland got locked in the bathroom. He did a shit.
- Female audience member questioned. Has never heard the show before and is very tired, she feels bad.
- Erock is brought out, says Anthony is not at the hotel yet. Erock saw Joe last night, he was drunk.

*End of broadcast*

-----

*We're off, with the Metallica version of Ecstasy of Gold...*

**First Break**

- And we are live. Anthony is here, he survived the casino. He woke up at 6.40am. Opie was nearly arrested for talking to hookers, they were cracked out, pregnant and thin. Oh Canada!
- One of the hookers said she was the mother of a popular R&amp;B singer. Who could this be? Jimmy pegged the location where Opie was, it was ""Club Soda"". 
- Opie played a video of R&amp;B singer, she's not that well known it seems. Opie got back around 11pm.
- Tom Papa has gone Hollywood: patterned shirts, new gait. Anthony picked up the dinner tab yesterday. Gary (Radio Wizard) made the staff pay for sandwiches. What a cheap, bald man.
- Sam, Troy, Gary, Roland, Erock, Mark Zito bought said sandwiches. They will be reimbursed. Gary is poor.
- Anthony went to the casino around midnight to ""play some cards"". He went from 2k, to 12k, to nothing: https://twitter.com/AnthonyCumia/status/360643563735879680
- A new album on the Opie &amp; Anthony Facebook page is being filled: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151720579160762.1073741831.8637380761&amp;type=3
- The broadcasters: https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/972245_10151720637250762_487630661_n.jpg; the audience: https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/972250_10151720637260762_816784829_n.jpg.
- *Colin Quinn* is in studio. We all missed him yesterday, he was busy working on his keynote.
- His writing process was interrupted on the plane due to Jimmy's farts. Everyone noticed.
- Colin was offered the part of Scott Evil in *Austin Powers*, he turned it down even though he didn't have to audition and Mike Myers gave him the part. He was scared and arrogant (his words).
- Reminded of Colin's *Crocodile Dundee II* rewrite, he regrets not taking the part in *Austin Powers*.
- Strip club talk, Colin remembers some on Long Island. They tried to be turned into 'Gentlemen Clubs'.
- Last night Colin did his *Unconstitutional* show, a club show and a gala. He's a popular man.
- Colin is laughing at Bobby's misfortune yesterday. Jimmy said he shit in Bobby's toilet and left it there, he regrets not shitting in the bath instead. He arranged the used toilet paper to frame the shit.
- It's the Midnight Surprise tonight, Colin ruined the surprise: he's a part of it. Back to strip clubs...
- Jimmy talks about a pilot he did which involved a chimp, he went to a strip club afterwards: ""It was great, they were all broke [..] they were all desperate and dirty."" Terrific.
- During WNEW, Jimmy fucked a women in the bathroom during an commercial break. Colin brings up Sandy Kane's ""What are you, gay?"" line. He loves that one.
- Opie brings up the time Sandy Kane sued them and fucked with them by not turning up to court.
- Guy and girl friends from the audience are spoken to, he's promptly called a faggot. 
- Jimmy wants to go to lunch with this girl, and go hat shopping. Respectful Jimmy coming up. He calls the date ""tentative"" and goes fishing for other girls in the audience...
- They find a girl called Kelly, she's a fan of the show and Jimmy. This looks promising. Jimmy can't flirt.
- Opie wants to do a ""hack"" dating game. Katrina and Kelly are put on the couch. Questions are coming...
- Question #1: ""What would the perfect first date with me be?"" Girl #1 likes gambling and drinking, Girl #2 likes beer darts and LA Guns.
- The dating game taking place via @DalexMTL: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360732585116172288 and the O&amp;A Facebook page: https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/969222_10151720719410762_1880960725_n.jpg
- Jimmy asks questions about pubic hair, Anthony gets right to the point and asks about their public hair.
- Kelly takes care of things, Katrina is shaved. Jimmy likes hair. He's a weird one that Jimmy.
- Questions from the audience are fielded. One asks how awkward it is for the guy friend, one asks if they would tweak Jimmy's nipples. Jimmy asks if they like spanking guys. Anthony asks them to rate themselves how crazy they are at sex. Katrina: 8. Kelly: 7.
 
-----

**Second Break**

- The Gary Busey bit is played during the break, CokeLogic's animation of it: http://youtu.be/hh63dX-UQwQ
- *Chris DeStefano* in studio, he's questioned as to why he didn't talk much yesterday.
- Chris says Bobby was aggressive yesterday, everyone agrees. And DeRosa was obsessed with dick sucking.
- Turns out, Chris can be aggressive too: he hit someone with a baseball bat, broke a chair over someones head for laughing at him after crying at 9/11. His father met with school principle, played the ""raped in the ass in jail"" card. Didn't work. Threatened to break principles knee caps. They became friends eventually.
- The Cannibal Cop was in Chris' class at school, he mentions some foreshadowing incidents.
- Caller calls in claiming to know Chris, he doesn't recognise him. Chris was on Letterman. 
- Photo of Colin and Chris on the studio sofa: https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/946290_10151720764320762_1672196995_n.jpg
- Chris met Tracy Morgan and gave him some advice about how to keep pussy wet. That Tracy!
- *Marc Maron* is now in studio, the audience gives him a round of applause. Marc is now ""that asshole on television"". He's still engaged, it's not going too well. Uh oh. 
- Turns out guys aren't as interested in weddings as girls, especially seeing as this is Marc's third.
- Anthony talks the issues behind inviting people to weddings. Now there's child talk. Spoiler: Anthony doesn't want any, ever. Will this third wedding pan out? Probably not.
- Daddy issues foster crazy girlfriends, makes a better pairing for fucked up comics. Story from Anthony: father walked out on a girl when she was 13/14 on Christmas. Happy time of year.
- Do the Dating Game girls have any daddy issues? Girl 1: father walked out at 19, cheated on mum. Girl 2: he's a guy's guy, still married to mother. Anthony asks if her step brothers want to fuck her. Let's hope!
- Ass fucking talk, a tabasco joke from Jimmy. Jimmy likes getting pissed on. Girl's piss sounds weird.
- Photos of the two ladies with Jimmy: https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1004812_10151720764310762_902755604_n.jpg
- Audience member lives in 'The Konk', Colin appreciates this reference. Long Island talk. He has a personalised licence plate, must mean he's human garbage.
- Anthony's Montreal analysis: it's quiet, peaceful, no crazy people, no horn honking. Colin said this politeness will end at the Midnight Surprise tonight.
- Chris' girlfriend was harassed by a homeless man, nearly kicked his dog dead. Marc is too old to fight.
- Girlfriends that provoke jealousy aren't warranted. Boyfriends don't pay attention sometimes.
- Sam says they have to break. What a kill joy. Marc, Colin and Chris are sticking around.

-----

**Third Break**

- We're back live. In studio recap: Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, Marc, Colin, Chris and a dwarf (*Brad Williams*).
- Brad says other dwarfs picketed him once, Jimmy asks about his comedy. Brad says he has to reference he's a dwarf, but his main act is observational. The dwarf jokes are flying.
- Opie inquires about dwarf dick. Average, but looks huge on him. So there's something.
- What's it like living as a dwarf? Everyone is interested (who wouldn't be). *Little People Big World* does not like Brad because he says 'midget', Opie loves that show.
- Jimmy asks do the usual dwarf acting roles get tedious, Brad says Peter Dinklage is changing that.
- There's a hierarchy in the dwarf world. Opie brings up the crying stripping dwarf story. Brad interjects with his own dwarf stripper story. 
- Colin calls out Jimmy for suggesting dwarfs are to blame for their own place in the world. 
- Marc Maron leaves, *Judah Friedlander* and *Joe DeRosa* are waiting in the wings. Judah joins the show.
- Judah talks about the underlying French and English language war in Montreal. Not sure if he's right.
- Comedy issue: club patrons receiving bills before the comics have finished, Judah wants to end this.
- Anthony says he commends Judah for not focusing on cancer. Photo from @DalexMTL of the show at the moment: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360763389020082180
- Colin chimes in, talks about the problems with comedy clubs. Probably material from his keynote.
- Last night, Anthony had fun with a French translation app. What happened to the dating game?
- Guess who's back? It's only Joe DeRosa! He tells a story about a Bar Mitzvah gig he did once.
- Joe mentions Colin's jab from earlier. Anthony brings up his casino visit. *Honeymooners* reference. Woo!
- Erock in studio. Terrific Kool-Aid Man joke from Anthony. Erock saw Joe last night... Says Joe was drunk, and said ""There's a lotta stink in this room"".  Tries to play it down. Joe acted like a tool it seems.
- Some photos from Facebook: Judah and Colin on the couch: https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/1006287_10151720879710762_945288225_n.jpg and Brad: https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1045010_10151720858960762_1121128555_n.jpg
- It's mutiny, Joe and Erock turn on each other. Fat, lonely and lazy jokes. Opie wants to hear from Denny.
- Sam says we need to break again. Colin is leaving. Everyone else is staying. Where's Jimmy Carr?!

-----

**Fourth Break**

- The fourth, and final break, has begun. The show is joined by *Bobby Kelly*, he's taking pre-emptive strikes against any fat jokes. I think he's being touchy.
- Turns out Colin didn't leave. Bobby and Joe unleash dwarf jokes. Brad is funny. Chip pipes up.
- The Dating Game will (or won't) be finished by the end of the show. Judah dislikes dishonesty.
- Cannabis laws in Canada are being discussed, legal or not? Under 3g and they won't arrest you apparently.
- Jimmy has characters, did you know? They are listed. Bobby is infuriated they are acknowledged. Joe brings up Valley Jim, no-one is a fan. No-one. Ted Sheckler is brought up; poor, underused Ted.
- Chip asks if James Lipton ever ""knocked a [whores] tits off"". Who knows. Probably? Valley Jim speaks up, gets a round of accused. These Canadians, huh?
- The Dating Game is continued. A quick recap of the girls: Kelly and Katrina. Here they are with Jimmy: https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1004812_10151720764310762_902755604_n.jpg
- Colin trashes the Dating Game, I'm inclined to agree. Nothing was accomplished. Can Jimmy save it? Chip is smooth with the ladies. Anthony asks if they go on dates easily. 
- Photo via @DalexMTL of everyone on the show right now: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360774693655019523
- Joe asks if the impromptu dates ended with sex. They say it was just a friendly lunch. Bobby asks if they see plastic wrap in a guy's bathroom, would they shit or leave the house?
- This leads Jimmy on to say he loves being pissed on and paying for it. Girl who hasn't heard the show before feels sorry for Jimmy, that's not good dating material.
- Girl who has heard the show is asked if sex is a possibility, Jimmy says there's no chance of them cumming even if they say yes. Neither of them watch porn. 
- Jimmy asks if either of them have ever had a threesome. Clever. One has, one hasn't. Judah is getting annoyed at the indirect answers. 
- We have a winner! Jimmy chooses... Kelly! Which one is that? I don't know. Chip ruins the mood, again.
- Another shot of the hosts and guests via the O&amp;A Facebook page: https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/249021_10151720930460762_1533667797_n.jpg
- Jimmy with Kelly via @DalexMTL: https://twitter.com/DALEXMTL/status/360778034032304128
- Opie, Anthony and Jimmy thank the audience, Montreal and all of the comics who appeared today.

1367702966.0	1dp5rk	For the listeners who jumped ship from Hoo Hoo to O&amp;A at what point did you start seeing through the BS.	megan_slaw	31	7	53	"I stumbled across Hoo Hoo's show back in 2007 when i was browsing Demonoid, and became a regular listener due to there being nothing even remotely close to it on UK radio and it was a very entertaining show.

It's almost a cliché to say it but it took a very sharp drop downhill when Artie left but i stuck with it thinking that he wouldn't renew the contract at the end of 2010.

When the contract was renewed and it was announced he'd do less shows i saw that almost all the people on fan websites and forums were incensed by this yet the callers who phoned in the show all said things like ""oh i don't care even 1 show a week would be worth the money I'm paying"". I realised he was purposely only putting through kiss ass callers who are the kind of fans who ring up every day and wait on hold just on the extremely rare off chance they get put through yet there was probably a lot of annoyed subscribers being left on hold till they either hung up or the show ended and 
were cut off.

I carried on listening but noticed little things like Robin was pretty much only on the show to cackle at anything Hoo Hoo says and Sal and Richard who are the funniest people on that show are hardly used as much and when they are Hoo Hoo is always stepping over them almost asserting his dominance. I would read all the time that Hoo Hoo is a great interviewer yet all he seemed to do was stamp all over everything anyone said until they either told him they were abused as a kid or that their wife/girlfriend does anal.

I completely gave up on the show when Hoo Hoo started doing AGT and whenever there was new show it would basically be.

1st Hour: AGT Talk
2nd Hour: Completely petty and uninteresting staff squabble over the most mundane issue
3rd Hour: Celebrity guest who gets stepped over constantly (Tom Sizemore saying don't Stern me summed this up nicely)

I had heard the name Opie and Anthony but like a lot of Hoo Hoo's fans who have never even listened to a full show was under the delusion perpetuated by Hoo Hoo that they were clones of him. It was whilst listening to some Louie CK clips on Youtube i was linked to omgwtfitssteve's Louie CK on O&amp;A: 01 - Snake in the Ass episode. I gave it a try and was amazed that not only was it a very funny show it also had fuck all resemblance to Hoo Hoo's show. I'll admit i was a 
bit shocked at first hearing Jimmy's style of comedy but that soon passed and the way guests are pretty much treated as 4th mic rather than having to fight through Hoo Hoos interruptions to get a joke out.

I noticed on any OandA Youtube clip where they are talking about their dealings with Hoo Hoo the comments section is full of Hoo Hoo's fans attacking O&amp;A mainly out of the same deluded loyalty i was under and I just wish they would have a listen to 1 full OandA show before perpetuating the myth that they are Hoo Hoo clones.

I have to say though that when i heard Hoo Hoo lost his final appeal against SiriusXM i was laughing so hard at the fact he's got another 2 and a half years of that eating away at him, knowing he's working for the very company that he believes owes him $330,000,000. I did listen to the clip of him moaning about this and i can honestly say that its the funniest 30 minutes of Hoo Hoo's show i think ive heard.

On the other side of it, I agree with Jimmy and Op, it was emergency situation and I think the safety of the community trumped everything at that point. Also Ant's cynical/insightful questions about the constitutionality of police/military interactions seemed to start from, oh, I don't know, after 2008 maybe?

I propose that this ""hey the lawyers are done being dicks"" attitude should not mean that its the Wild West again for show uploaders. Why would the lawyers allow someone to undercut their entire business model for the enjoyment of fans who did not pay? The answer: they won't. If they get wind of any upload sites, they will get C&amp;D's.

Keep links to PM's, and stop mentioning these sites at every turn. There is no reason for it, and it isn't cautious or courteous to the uploaders. THey don't get paid to upload, so if they get a C&amp;D its over. Why would they risk litigation for your free enjoyment?

So what's the difference between the hole and these interns?

* Holes: Forced on radio shows by Program Director.
* Interns: Not sure who arranges this or if O&amp;A have control over who their interns are. We'll call this N/A


* Holes: Annoying laughter.
* Interns: Annoying Background Laughter. Check.


* Holes: Bring funny to a screeching halt.
* Interns: We had a great segment with Steve Byrne and Amy Schumer today. It was funny, a lot of good stories, and then all of a sudden we need to stop and talk about the interns' social lives. A complete sharp left turn. Check.

Any others anyone can think of? Seems pretty hypocritical to me to bash women for not being funny on the radio yet letting these two hog airtime. I have nothing against them personally, but they're not interesting."	t5_2se0w	True

Saturday Night Virus was an open format show that ran between 2007-2008 on Saturday nights from 9:00pm -- 12:00am, where O&amp;A comics would each host a show on different weeks. The slot is still called ""Saturday Night Virus"" but really the idea died once XM axed paying out all these comics having their own shows, here's the [OApedia article](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Saturday_Night_Virus) on it.

Between Louis CK berating callers, Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa screaming at eachother, Patrice giving out relationship advice, Saturday Night Virus displayed some of the most entertaining radio in broadcasting history. I'm sure most of you are aware of its existence, but if not take the time to check out the shows that were a part of this project, and it still bugs the shit out of me that this went away.

I won't disclose my name, but I'm not a piece of shit trucker that adds zilch to the program.  We all know some callers aren't the best, and truthfully some of my calls have bombed as well.

However,  some of my calls into the show have also been a huge hit.  In fact, a few of them were posted on youtube by other listeners, and even posted in this very subreddit.  One call I had with the guys was over 20+ minutes long on-air.

Anywho, this isn't a pat on my back kind of post, nor am I trying to come off sounding like a cunty fan or a hater.  I'm not a psycho fan, I'll call up maybe once every two or three months.  I'm simply kind of annoyed at Sal's lack of understanding of the show and professionalism when handling the phones. 

Every screener prior to Sal has answered going ""What's your name and where are you calling from?""  Sal refuses to do this.  He'll answer quickly with either a quickly spoken and hard to listen ""O&amp;A"" or just a ""hello.""  He hangs up mid-way through your first sentence about your call (which doesn't allow the punchline to get out), and just does an overall piss-poor job of getting the most out of the phones.  

O&amp;A have always prided themselves on being a listener friendly show, and I feel like Sal's really dropping the ball on potential listener provided content.

On another note, Troy Quan was O&amp;A's best phone screener ever, no bullshit.

**TL;DR fuck SAL**

Satellite radio is commercial free generally, but talk channels need commercials 'cause you can't talk for 4 hours straight.  Fine.  Understood.

Jimmy probably told over 1 hour and 45 min of original, dirty and well thought out bits. Despite the stupid shitheads that kept getting up during the show to go piss, Jimmy's bits kept my eyes/ears/mind focused on what he was saying, despite how ridiculous. Not only does he provide the laughs, but the social commentary that we are all so used to on the show demands attention and respect. 

He had ridiculous bits on trannys and massages (happy endings?) while also using very serious current events (Aurora/Sandy Hook/Federal Gov't) to allow people an opportunity to laugh instead of grieve or get pissed off. (Serious I know, apologies. Jimmy made sure this point came across)

My favorite part is when he turned into Chip Chipperson without any warning and some ppl just did not get it. HYSTERICAL! Chip's improv was as stupid, incomplete and hacky as you could expect. Then Uncle Paul came around to babysit and get crib marks on his legs until Edgar needed his teeth licked.

Personally, I had an outstanding time because my original seats (for me and my brother) were behind a filming camera and allowed me to spot Opie in the wings. I was able to pass on a sentiment from Mistress Carrie from WAAF (afternoon drive DJ) who claims Opie was a very important influence for her to continue in radio. Opie obviously remembered the name because he came right over and I was able to shake his hand, tell him how much of a fan I was while he asked to pass good graces on to his former employee.  About 10 minutes later, my seats were upgraded 3 rows closer and in the dead center of the theatre. As I was told by Mistress Carrie on Friday (I work at WAAF) some serious shit when down when Opie and Anthony were banned from Boston inside the station and bad blood was split everywhere.

Also, I said hello to Club Soda Kenny, literally just as robotic as the b-b-b-b-boys describe. 

TLDR; Jimmy Killed, I met Opie and passed on positive sentiments to my boss/ his former co-worker
