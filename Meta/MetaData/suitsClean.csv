1374699773.0	1izdba	SPOILERS: It made sense for Mike to do what he did at the end of S3,E2	johnson256	119	9	51	"All over this subreddit, people are pretty pissed off with Mike's decision to abandon his agreement with Louis that the two would work together, and he abandoned him to join forces with Harvey once again. Obviously, it seems like a shitty thing to do on first glance, but it makes complete sense for Mike to do what he did and if any of us were in Mike's situations, we'd be morons to turn our backs on Harvey. 

For Mike, Harvey risked his entire livelihood to get this brilliant guy with serious work ethic issues out of the dumps and (illegally, may I add) bring him to Pearson Hardman. He risked losing the trust of everybody around him, his job, and potentially spending time behind bars. When somebody makes that many risks for a single person, the person in question should be 100% loyal. It's why Harvey was mad at Mike for his decisions at the end of season 2. 

Had Mike not gone back to Harvey, even if Louis had offered the world and more to him, Mike would officially be the most self-entitled, gutless, ungrateful character on television. It sucks to see Louis vulnerable like that, but saying that Mike should stand up for himself would be utterly ridiculous in that situation. "	t5_2s5j7	True

...;____;

Next week looks amazing, as usual. Shame it's already the Summer Finale! 

**Burning Question 1:** [Speculation](#s ""From the preview, it looks like Louis will vote Hardman. Do you think the firm will split? I don't see Jessica sticking around if things don't go her way, and Harvey will surely follow (with Donna and Mike...maybe Rachel). There is the possibility that Louis still voted for Jessica but she still lost... Hrm. The non-compete clause is an excellent point to bring up; if Jessica loses she won't be able to run with Harvey and start a new firm (unless a loophole is discovered/exploited)."")

**Burning Question 2:** [Speculation](#s ""From the ending of tonight's episode, it's clear that Mike has been shaken to the core with the death of his grammy. Rachel will be leaving for Law School (inevitably) and Harvey will be dealing with the vote and Louis, so he won't have any sort of support structure to fall back on and recuperate from this devastating loss.

The reasoning for this new rule is primarily because of the abundance of such posts clogging up the subreddit. Several threads asking for streaming links are posted each week, and the entire bottom third of some episode discussion threads consist of people asking for links to the episode.

The other reason, of course, is that we all love the show, and we would like to encourage people to support the show by watching it via legal means. (And honestly, it's very easy to find the episodes by using Google if you need to.)

1357574457.0	164h9w	Mike is becoming Harvey, Harvey is becoming Mike (SPOILERS)  	Japappydee	50	5	11	"Hey all! I just watched through the two seasons of suits and I thought I would bring up an observation I made to generate some discussion. The title is pretty self explanatory Mike is starting to take on a lot of Harvey characteristics. His outward body language has changed from closed off and timid to tall and confident (obviously nicer suits). The way he has moved from someone caring too much and looking into clients and is now somewhat ruthless and referred to as the ""new attack dog"". He is now not even afraid to step up to authority like Harvey (talks back to Jessica and Litt) Mike went from being a somewhat of a romantic and is beginning to have womanizing ways (a married woman?!) Basically Mike is becoming hardened. 

Now I also believe as much as Mike is turning into Harvey I think Harvey is turning into Mike. Let's look at it physically we saw harvey in casual clothing (not in a suit) at least a handful of episodes in the second season and I believe never in the first. Harvey even begins supporting a less rigid more casual mike-esque haircut toward the end of the second season. Harvey used to never look into the real story and what not of clients and starts to on a couple cases. Harvey starts loosening up even smokes weed with Mike (which was forbidden in the beggining) He starts to show emotion toward others esspecially Donna and I think we realize how important she is when he protects her in mock trial. Toward the end of season two we see Harvey sporting khakis and visiting the grave of his father simultanously contrasted with Mike trying to intimidate Monica into coming forward (the scene where he is called the 'new attack dog') Basically Harvey is softening up

My prediction for the remaining of season 2 and future seasons? Unless all of this is coincidence and based on the brilliant writing of this show I don't think that is the case, as Harvey becomes more progressively humanized we are going to see Mike become progressively dehumanized. I think the last thing grounding him to his true self and not completely embodying the ""suit"" was his grandma, the one person who he seeked to escape the firm and recharge and become human again. Now that tether is gone, who knows what will happen and what problems that'll cause. I'm excited to see more emotion from Harvey as he exposes himself abit from that ""suit"" facade he keeps up.

Anyways It's long but I just watched both seasons and week and can't stop thinking about it!! Can't wait for the return! "	t5_2s5j7	True

1. We see Hardman hang around, since the show needs a good heavy. Someone other than Louis, who is more of a workhorse for the company.

2. More Louis! The guy is awesome at being an annoying asshole, but he's also shown to be extremely good at what he does. Hopefully we'll see more of him in action.

3. More of Mike's descent into being Harvey-Lite. It's coming and I can see it every few episodes, where Mike is willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to win. I hope we see more of it.

I Fear:

1. That Mike will hook up with Rachel. Honestly, I just don't feel it and don't see that much chemistry between the two of them. I'd rather see Jenny back, even for a brief run, while they try to work out the disconnect between Rachel and Mike.

2. Harvey softens a bit in order to ""save the firm"". He's better at being a dick, and that's where I hope they keep him. I did like the character development for him with the flashback episode, but those segments should come in limited doses.

3. Jessica is removed as partner. While I think they've actually made her out to be more of a villain than anyone we've seen, I'd be bummed if Jessica was fired. Only because, I just don't see how the show would be able to fit her in."	t5_2s5j7	True

Yes, it could be a deception, but I highly doubt it. This way they still have a story line for the other 6 episodes in the season (Winter can't come fast enough!). 

Jessica stays on after losing, or takes a leave of absence, and Harvey is treated like shit by Hardman and without Mike (who drifts away because of the loss) he is having problems with a couple of cases and after an episode or two Harvey realizes that he needs Mike and he goes and pulls him up from his dark place. 

Mike will come (not actually sure if he'll leave, maybe he'll just get lippy and angry with Harvey and friend Hardman since Hardman recently had a loss as well) back and start to read everything in the firm's history in order to blackmail Hardman, and in doing so finds out what a lot of people here have been saying all along: Hardman set up Harvey to be sued by Travis Tanner.

All I'm thinking is that this is going to have repercussions. Think about every time something like this has happened to Louis: he has turned sour and used it as leverage. 

I think this will end up with him not only becoming bitter again, but with him finding out about the coup d'état Harvey is planning, and doing what he can to stop it. He will use this ""betrayal"" to fuel his revenge on Mike and Harvey.

But there's still one huge snag in that Louis doesn't know Mike's secret. 

Specifically from s03e02, Louis explains that Harvey's passion for winning overshadows his passion for the law (the line was something to the effect of ""the law is Harvey's vehicle, winning is the passion""). Louis however, is the biggest stickler for the minutiae of the law, and he, as he says, loves the law. 

Sure, he greatly pursued the idea of Mike (super intelligent, highly effective, licensed attorney), but its difficult to guess his reaction to the actual Mike (a fraud). "	t5_2s5j7	True

1344314127.0	xt2ys	"So, my wife and I saw part of ""Rewind"" being filmed..."	penfield	30	5	3	"So, my wife and I were in Toronto the week ""Rewind"" was made, not that we knew that going in. The scene where Mike is mocking Harvey and leaning on his bike? It was shot this past July 4th at the [corner of Bay and Richmond](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=390+bay+street+toronto&amp;layer=c&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;sll=43.651195,-79.381648&amp;cbp=13,238.3,0,0,0&amp;cbll=43.651275,-79.381469&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=0CAoQ2wU&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vJkgUIvcNsWGxgHm6IGoDg).

We walked right through that scene in between shots, since it was on a busy street corner during the daytime and everyone else going about their regular business, despite all the cameras and crew and whatnot. We didn't even realize what was going on until we glanced to our right and saw Gabriel Macht getting his makeup fixed. Both of us being big fans of the show, we were totally stunned. We were like, Is that who we think it is? What do we do now?

He looked *exactly* the way he looks on tv, except thinner. He's all jawline and shoulders in an amazing suit and just standing there looking like ten million bucks. 

We went to lunch (when your wife is pregnant and hungry I guess it isn't that important to stick around in case Sarah Rafferty was there) and came back to gawk and maybe see some other stars, but they were done and were taking everything down. The shwarma truck in that scene is fake; they also had a fake mailbox, a fake NYTimes vending machine, etc. Really interesting to see some behind the scenes stuff.

So how long is it taking them to go from shooting to broadcast? About five weeks? We were wondering when we were going to see that scene come up. Hmph, how about that.

edit: Smacking my forehead. Wife and I FINALLY got the chance to watch this episode, and it turns out we saw Trevor (Tom Lipinski) as well, that day. Or I did, at any rate. Didn't even realize that was him; while we were walking through the scene I looked to my left and saw a really thin guy in a suit just sort of standing around. I figured he was part of whatever filming was going on because of how, I dunno, *put-together* he looked? He's got a noticeably...flat head. Like if you're looking straight at him, his head is noticeably thinner than if you looked at him in profile. Anyway, it was after that that we glanced to our right, saw Gabriel Macht, and our jaws dropped.

In hindsight, what KILLS us is that there was a damn good chance Mike (Patrick Adams) was around, but we didn't notice! Probably because he was dressed so low-key. "	t5_2s5j7	True

1374680071.0	1iylrw	Suits Appreciation Post	DurgAddictedGenius	30	4	8	"I wanted to just appreciate how good Suits has been as a show.

I've always enjoyed USA shows, but they've tended to be pretty formulaic. White Collar, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, etc, it's always the same: a one episode client/bad guy/medical case/issue, with mentioning the background story at the very start and some minor development at the very end.

Suits has gone more of the way I like, like Breaking Bad, where it's more continuous. It's still episodic, but it isn't really repetitive.

Beyond that, they've had some pretty interesting characters, and relationship dynamics which you often don't see, especially regarding development. And with most of these other shows, everyone's role is kind of fixed, and it's interesting with things like the merger and Harvey's play at Managing Partner.

Beyond that, they've done everything pretty well, in terms of humor (Donnameasurringdick.gif), drama, etc.

It's been a good show, and you never really know what to expect. I just wanted to appreciate it. I hope this becomes one of those shows that slowly grows and becomes big. They've done a good job in producing it, and I look forward to future episodes, and what they have in store for us."	t5_2s5j7	True

I thought it was awesome how he started to actually connect with Mike. With that said, there's nothing he could ever to for Mike that could remotely touch what Harvey has done for him. Harvey risked his career, his life, and everything in between for Mike, and he felt betrayed. Despite that, he still comes back and forgives him in the end.

There seems to be so much Harvey hate lately, but think about who he is as a person: he does not trust easily and he's known not to get close to people. This was all true before Mike. Then, he finally sticks his neck out for someone and not only does he get betrayed by Mike, but it happens simultaneously by Jessica, who was the other person he had developed some sort of personal connection with. Pile on top of that a merger that he doesn't want and a breakup (of sorts) with Scotty. The guy is going through a tougher time in his life than any of us could possibly imagine. Even for someone as seemingly bulletproof as Harvey, that's really tough.

1345004115.0	y8tqr	Who will Louis side with? [SPOILERS]	RedVell	25	2	25	"I’m sorry this is so long, but the gist of this is that I think the writers of Suits A) Will  or  B) Should  have Louis vote for Hardman to run the company.  If you don’t want to read it, just leave a comment!


Firstly I would like to point out that if this were a movie Louis would vote for Pearson, and we, as an audience, would be happy with the ending.  However, we must understand that this a TV show, and however great we would feel at the end of such an event it would leave the show unsatisfied for further opportunities.  We would see Harvey doing what he always does, solving cases like nobody’s business - which is awesome, but like the show ‘House’, however awesome a character is, if they’re doing the same thing over and over again with a slightly different plotline ending with some miracle revelation that saves everything, we end up yelling “we get it!”

On the other hand, if Louis chose Hardman what would happen? Shit would get real, that’s what would happen.  And when shit gets real what would we see?  We would get to see a new side of many characters.  We would get to see Harvey and Jessica lose their power, and we would get to see them struggle and fight to get back their power (opening up all kinds of possibilities for the next season, or even this season depending on how many episodes are left).  

We would then also get to see where Rachel’s loyalty lies.  She has had her romantic conflicts with Mike, and she has never (that I can remember) shown any direct contact with ‘the sharks’ of the company Harvey or Jessica.  Therefore it might be predicted that with Louis’ new status, and their recent Ballet Bondings, Rachel would be inclined to further strengthen her ties with him as well as Hardman. (And from here on I will assume that’s what Rachel will do.)

With Rachel on that side of the fence, what is left for our poor fake lawyer protagonist genius Mike Ross? Sure as hell a damn lot, that’s what.  Mike has no choice but to stay with Harvey and Jessica, as they are the one’s protecting his secret – and let’s be honest, Mike and Harvey are just too comical together to split up. Ever.  So, while Mike’s using his super genius powers for good to restore Harvey and Jessica to their rightful places, what happens next?  Oh yeah, that’s right, Rachel is on team Louis/Hardman, but she still really loves him, and we get to have some cute star-crossed lovers action happening.

Unfortunately for this scenario, what happens to my favourite character? (And if you’re not thinking ‘Donna’, you’re wrong).  I honestly don’t know what would happen to Donna.  It seems she couldn’t come back to the company, unless as a first order of business under Hardman’s rule the super Harvey/Mike team use their legal prowess to have her reinstated.  Otherwise she could act as an outside character to the firm, meeting up with Harvey on occasion and helping him do some frowned upon legal tradings etc.

But the #1 reason why Louis should vote Hardman?  Because it makes sense!  Louis is actually another character I really like - I know, I know, he’s portrayed as a sleaze etc. – but he’s had the shittiest circumstances of the characters in the show.  We know that he is a good lawyer, we know he is good at is his job, and he can do a lot of things that Harvey can’t do and that is shown in the flashback episode when Harvey has him look through the money to see who is stealing from the company.  Besides being good at his job, Harvey looks down on him because in this regard Harvey’s just being an egotistical ass, and Jessica does not give him the respect he deserves.  And for this reason, realistically, he will side with Hardman."	t5_2s5j7	True

It rested too much on the overwrought relationship drama. New DA Terrence Wolf (Chi McBride) didn't really seem to have a reason for opposing Harvey, and since this is the first time we've seen him, it wasn't all that interesting. Honestly? This isn't the biggest challenge Harvey's faced.

It was pretty obvious where the episode was going with Trevor and Rachel and Jenny and Mike. A bit too obvious of a cliffhanger.

There were some good quotes there, though. ""Litt, Nothing, and Nobody"", Rachel not having seen *any* classic ""old"" movie (to be fair, I haven't seen most of them either), Louis' ears, and whatever Harvey and Donna were doing with a can opener (the possibilities are endless... :P). Pretty much most of the character interaction was great – it's just the plot that was weak.

Sure you're smart, successful, and handsome, but come on there must be more to it than that. You're constant wise ass cracks and jokes always bugged me. I wanted to see the real Harvey, they man behind the facade. And last night I think we finally got it for the first time.

It started with the opening scene, you know when Tanner mentioned your mother. The smirk came off your face and you slugged him pretty damn quick. I was glad you did that, Tanner was pretty annoying. But it kind planted the spark. What happened with your mom and dad. Throughout the episode we heard mentions to your lack of vulnerability and inability to really show his feelings, culminating with you cutting Jessica off and calling showing ones feelings ""weak"".

But I want to know what happened! What messed you up that bad Harvey? For the first time we've seen Harvey's armor crack, but what caused it build it up in the first place. Redditor elfishwebbly (sorry idk how else to cite you!) mentioned the scene where you said ""My friend learned that his mother never loved his father, and cheated on him for years."" But, clearly, I think that was you.

You saw your father give your mom all his love. And what did he get? A cheating wife who didn't love back. That's what he got for being vulnerable and really caring. Jackshit, and world of pain. 

But you're not going to make that mistake are you Harvey. From a young age, you didn't truly care about anyone. You knew the consequences. Sure you've had relationships and friendships, but because you saw the outcome of caring, they haven't truly been meaningful and deep. So in this way you are a tragic hero. You got to let that armor down Harvey. And I can't wait to see the man behind it, when you do.

1315092881.0	k3wpe	"As Asked: My interpretation and characterization of 
the main characters.(Harvey)"	ReneG8	14	0	2	"Ok here we go. I just wanted to give my insights to the characters of Suits, my opinion on their deleopment, what I like what I dont like. Even if its just for the two people who asked me to do this, its worthwhile. Keep in mind im not big on lawyer shows in general, which is probably not a bad perspective to have.

[edit] I see this will take more time than I thought, I will make this for each character individually

**Harvey:**

*Actor* Gabriel Macht is spot on imo, nothing more to say.

*General:*
The pilot establishes him as the shark-type lawyer with a heart for certain kinds of people. It is implied that he is rather wealthy, dresses nice (tbh, REAL nice, I like that style) and has a leeway work attitude if its not something he is largely interested in.

*Character development*
As we go further into the series, it becomes more and more clear that his kind of work has developed his attitude towards others. He probably was more open (like mike) in the beginning of his career, but he met more louises on the way and learned only to trust the real trustworthy ones.
What I like so far, that he is not shown as evil or self centered, he is loyal to certain kinds of people. That lets him differ from the predefined role of asshole attorney.
Up until episode 11 he never really has a big thing which lets his Guard down, which shatters his composure. Whether it is, because he has seen all kinds of shit and isnt phased anymore, or because the real big thing has yet to happen remains to be seen. For my part this makes the character a bit 2 dimensional.

Don't get me wrong, I like his badassery and his do or die mentoring, but for the series to be more believeable, the character has to drop out of certain predefined roles.

Where we come to another thing that irks me about him

*similarity to House*

Lets put the obivous ones, like genius and has certain old fashioned hobbies aside.
He is the same kind of amoral pain in the arse to get what he wants and what usually is the right thing to do, putting social norms aside. He has the same Eureka Moments, almost int the same fashion House gets it; that is, during a random conversation with mike/wilson about another topic.
The relationship Jessica/Harvey is the same kind of relationship Cuddy/house have. With the exception of me ever seeing harvey jessica being together.
Another thing is that his interest has to be sparked in order to get his genius working. See harvey and pro bono cases.

Tbh the series has to differ a bit more from that. On the top of my hat, I can't find anything that wouldn't make it look like trying too hard, but they should imo refrain from drawing more paralells.

*what I would like to see*

As written in the episode thread and seen above, I would like him to overcome a big obstacle, one where he is on the edge and has to activate his genius. One where his suaveness drops and falls, and he is really pressured. I'd like him to acknoledge and ask for the help of mike, in a way that makes it obvious that the two of them as partners. While the series kinda established said fact, they both never acknowledged it to each other in a fashion. That seems to coming in the next episode.

I would like his special relationship with donna being played out more. However someone else said in another thread that more donna wouldn't necessarily better and that might be true. I'd like them to try it out anyways, just to see it.

2. Or does it actually mean Harvey has more ownership of Jessica's stock? (so Jessica owns even less then 49% of the company). This seems weird to me that Jessica would further decrease her net ownership of the firm. "	t5_2s5j7	True

Otherwise, it was a great episode. In the end, Harvey had to pretend to cross his boundaries (as Tanner would) to convince Tanner to back off. I knew he wouldn't *actually* perjure himself and such; he just needed to make Tanner think he would.

Rachel seemed to be way overreacting, even for a false accusation of being a traitor. It made me legitimately suspect her for a bit (since she actually went to get a job at the firm she was fired from). The ""oh, you're *not* dating?"" joke is getting a bit old with her and Mike.

Mike's astonishment at the fact that they have an IT department was a little ridiculous, and I'm surprised Ben the IT guy didn't know who Louis was (or knew who he was in the firm, but didn't know what he looked like).

Also, Jimmy's a moron for just taking a rival firm's word that they'd help him out if he helped them. Mike clearly didn't want to get him kicked out for making a single mistake, but he knew what he had to do to clear Rachel's name.

Tanner's scheming was pretty entertaining, especially because he used his knowledge that Harvey would look into him to trick Harvey into being there so he could loudly ""talk to Harvey"" about a settlement offer.

Rachel forcing Louis to apologize was great, just because he's been an ass so far.

I felt they didn't really make it clear who Vanessa was to Harvey, or how they know each other, or anything. She just sort of showed up in the episode to give Harvey what he needed.

Hartman knew he had lost by that point, and throughout most of the show, he's been saying that he is much less devious than others make him out to be. But his first reaction after being fired was that the same thing would eventually happen to Jessica. I think he mostly did it out of spite and was projecting his thoughts of what he would do onto them.

Harvey regards Jessica as his 'mentor', and we've seen that he would never willingly betray his mentors. Plus, he's been content with following Jessica's lead lately with regards to the vote, and Hartman in the past few episodes, more so than the start of the season.

I get that she may have seriously considered the idea, I mean, look at Harvey, and she's an attractive woman. And there may have been a time the line became blurred...but it was never crossed, which I'm glad for.

And the scene between her and Rachel did nothing to me, mostly  because we haven't really seen those two as friends before, aside from the one off-hand remark that Donna likes Rachel. And I don't really see it - the writers seem to think that just because they are both woman, they should be friends and naturally have a rapport with each other, but I really don't see Donna having any patience for Rachel's self-made dramas.

1315547898.0	k9r57	Louis: Why can't shows provide decent rivals/antagonists.	loginan	9	0	5	"I hated how Louis has been portrayed as they incompetent, loser archetype to Harvey's suave perfect. At first I thought the character would have a decent chance to shine and prove himself as an equal to Harvey, or at least be shown to be great in his own right. But the season finale cemented that the show is making him out to be a comic relief/annoyance and no real threat to the perfect Harvey. How can he be an antagonist/rival if there is no chance of him taking on Harvey, in the board room or the court room.

This episode had him: 

* being easily manipulated by Donna.

* Being told by Jessica he is nothing.

* Confronting Jessica about being nothing, and then simply acquiescing to her request for the DNA.

Past episodes had him as a loser getting knee to the crotch, being outwit by Donna and seen as a laughing stock with no real power.  Louis' value has gone down with each episode and he has gone from being an antagonist in the beginning to being a comic relief in later episodes, the show is going down the path of making the main character infallible and his closest (to date) opponent a no-threat. 

Louis should have character development and be given real plot development and skill sets. I hope season 2 will be better.

I know that Suits Season 2 finished like a month or so ago on Dave in the UK, but I'm guessing that Season 3 won't be picked up again until about January 2014 in Britain. I can't wait that long!

I found a live stream of USA, but the show would start at about 2am in the UK (not sure whether it's before or after Covert Affairs but the point is that it'd be too late), so I can't really use it.

I understand that USA's website runs a service similar to BBC iPlayer, where you can watch already-broadcast shows online. I have a VPN which actually works which I could use to get this. Does USA usually add shows on within about 12 hours after they're broadcast? If not, do people upload shows to websites and stuff?

She's at the top, and a well respected lawyer. But honestly, what does she do? Not to say she doesn't have overwhelming responsibility as a name partner, but the way we see her is someone who engages in occasional banter, limits Harvey, and is getting rather sloppy. 
I'm predicting she screws up, she gets caught up in some heat of the moment scenario and makes another bad call (the confidentiality agreement with Hardman being the first). Perhaps something with this merger goes catastrophic.

Side note: I wasn't really clear on this last week, is that merger an actual thing that's going down...or was it all just a hoax to nail Hardman?

Anyway, I feel as though Pearson ____ will crumble, leaving the pieces for Harvey and someone else. Perhaps Litt Specter Scott? Or maybe not even crumble, but I do think Jessica is going to be outed at some point, but I don't think her story ends there. 

Going back to the mock trial, I can really see her as a Judge. She's not a better lawyer than Harvey, for sure, because Harvey is that dude. But she does know the law better (somewhat a reference to her challenging Mike sans laptop). Somehow I don't see her as a good fit anymore, maybe it's because I'm supposed to feel that way, maybe I'm crazy. But I can definitely see Harvey answering only to himself, Louis handling the business aspect of a law firm (probably better than Jessica could), and Scottie as an optional extra character to provide conflict/keep Harvey in check/something. 

In this new business, Harvey would of course rid the firm of the Harvard-only rule, and Rachel could of course work there.

Every episode has a unique case that's solved within 42 minutes. I know the networks love that because anyone who tunes in in the middle of the season will be as in-the-loop as someone who's watched the whole series, but it makes the show feel *cheap*, like CSI, Fringe or any number of common network shows.

Over the course of the last season they began to focus more on Mike's secret and his relationship to Rachel, which is promising. Still, I want Harvey Specter to be the next Don Draper, and for that to happen he needs to take on epic season-long challenges instead of 12 quick ones. Hopefully as the network sees the shows fanbase and their investment in the characters, we'll get a more serialized show.

I originally started watching suits and became addicted because of Harvey's quick wit, the fast and exciting cases, and of course the sexy ladies. 

Now, I think it's safe to say the only thing remaining of those three in this season is the sexy ladies. However, even they have become sort of boring - there is no element of surprise - we've now seen Rachel and Donna both have sex with other characters and frankly, it's becoming a bit overplayed. 

I'm not saying there isn't any quick wit remaining, I thought harvey had some good lines last night, but it's become less common. Now, with regards to the cases - we've spent the entire season on one rather mundane case that has been droning on for far too long. 

There's also just been some really corny shit - for example when Katrina put that image on all the computers or last night with those little plaques the associates got. I understand this show isn't realistic in the slightest - but at least make the inner-firm attacks somewhat creative. These have seemed like they came out off of a junior high fan fiction blog. 

I suppose I'm just a fan of a different time in the series, which the writers must have felt was too repetitive. I can understand this, as pretty much every episode was a new case and as many have said before Mike would have that magic spark off some random thing and solve the case and Harvey would finish everything off. They needed to incorporate new elements, but I just feel they have left some of the important ones that made the show so wildly successful out. The only reason I still watch is because I have an investment in these characters..I'm not sure if I were a new viewer if I would be as interested - many of the scenes in the last few episodes seem more like romantic drama at times.

Anyways, some of my statements are hyperbole, but I have found this season underwhelming and was just curious if anyone else has seen things similarly or differently."	t5_2s5j7	True

&gt;One of the controversial deletions (Laughs) was a scene with Donna, Jessica, and Harvey dancing to celebrate their victory. It was cut for a couple of reasons. One, I thought it slowed the episode down. I thought we had multiple endings. And the other reason was, it just felt in my gut not the show. But the writer of the episode was like, “These characters would do that. It’s organic.” She loved it. We talked it through, and I ultimately decided it was best not to have it in there. But it will be on the DVD, and I know that people will love to see it. In and of itself, it is a great scene.

For example I want to test my theory that the quality of the previous episode defines how good the ratings are for the following episode. For example a bad episode (determined by fan reaction) will rate well because the episode that immediately proceeded it was good.

To that end I will be putting up a poll every week for fellow Suits fans to rate the weeks episode out of 10.

Edit: I eventually want to have color coded ratings graph's based on an average of fan reactions, including the rough trend. Also I am planning on doing a comparison of all USA original shows against each other on a graph to determine which is the most likely to be renewed and/or canceled.

Edit 2: [I have compiled a comparison of all the USA Network shows that are airing this summer and graphed the results. Burn Notice came out on top with a slender lead, Suits was a strong second with the others roughly 15%+ behind. ](http://ratingswatch.blogspot.com.au/2012/08/usa-network-summer-lineup-ratings.html)"	t5_2s5j7	True
1341894417.0	wb8da	More season 2 predictions?	unsubscribeFROM	9	5	10	"I had some random thoughts I had about next season that hit me at 5 o clock in the morning so I typed them out. Sorry for cursing and ridiculesness of things but honestly my mind can't operate better at the moment.

-Shit goes real bad for Harvey, character fleshed out more, some of the girl he was on a few dates with last season(ex-wife?)

-Mike inevitably breaking down and admits his feeling to Rachel but this will take way longer to happen than we expect.

-Oh wait Rachel found someone!! or more likely she has to move after passing bar but I want more Rachel.

-Hardman exposed as a dick, he's too likeable now as a character

-shit from his daughter, maybe partying/drugs but she is acting so weird its clear she has a role to play. Would put money on depression.

-Maybe Mike is assigned to be her guardian. maybe she gets infatuated with Mike, finds out his secret/blackmails him. Drama.

-Donna makes a move on Harvey way later on in the season. Awkward ensuing moment but Harvey has hooked up dramatically with his ex already. Heartbreak for Donna and all fans go aww because who can't love Donna.

-Relationship for Louis as well as joining another firm and becoming the enemy. Jessica actually expressing sorrow but then she becomes a massive baddass and some great exchanges of threats and insults occur.

-New characters - young juniour lawyer who become Mikes new buddy for hanging out

-New old guy thrown into the mix who is super wealthy and has huge sway in future of firm.

-Some new super rich partying for Mike in Entourage style. Could mix in cocaine here but no need, too risque.

-new hot character to distract Mike and add character. Also they hook up quick and have good sex but shes not right for him

-Mikes Granny dies. Honestly they can't do much more with her story, old wise people don't sell high octane drama. Will be tearjerking.

-Huge legal complications within firm, potential split and ensuing epic legal battle.

-Some dating for Jessica. I'm apathetic towards it happening but it probably will.

-A couple of cliched case of the week episodes where Mike pulls something out his ass again and again.

-It ws mentioned earlier that you could have to send your previous graduates to Harvard to promote your law firm. This will be Mike ofcourse which will be shit tripping adventure. Brilliant Deux ex machina will occur and it will be so enjoyable watching him escape.

-Quick idea that Mikes next girl actually be from Harvard and she has to be rich and wealthy represent the seductive nature of well, wealth and power.

-Eventually Mike has to be exposed I think but the truth is that he still passed the bar hasn't he? Therefore he can still continue working but shit will be dramatic.

-Mike does some insane good lawyering throughout season and everybody kinda goes ""This boy be schooling everyones ass""

-I hope we get less moral posturing but suits loves it. Would prefer Mike just to be a bad ass and not be constantly face with 2 shit options. I watch Suits for fun and I fell it doesn't do moral quandaries very well because they made Mike too likeable and they cannot be near as ruthless as HBO therefore it always feels a bit limp and censored.

While she did find the episodes entertaining, she didn't get hooked enough to continue watching it, even though the degree she's working towards is somewhat related to the world presented in this show.

Could this be maybe because there is not one dominant female character she could relate to? I, personally, have never seen Jessica fully suitable for her job [spoiler](/s ""(maybe that's also why I'm so worried that Hardman will regain his old position)"") and I also think that Rachel doesn't really have much influence on the story arc, [spoiler](/s ""especially now that she's moving on from Mike"").

My theory is that a sexual occurrence between them happened but it was too weird for them so they called it off.

I know what he did with the cheating stealing etc was super bad but what if he really wasnt planning on coming back till harvey pushed him. There are tons of scenes where it seriously seems like he is trying to help or at least not interfere and Harvey or Jessica goes in and chews him out hardcore. A guy retaking his company with a legitimate vote? I like Jessica more and obviously wanted her to win but it does say his name on the door. He planted the document. That is bad. That is the only evil thing I can see he did. Maybe it shows a long planning evil plot or something? After he is kicked out of the firm because of the nondisclosure, THATS when he really starts coming after them. But before, nothing really feels like something a man who had changed might do after coming back to a job he loves.

However, what Im wondering is why was season 2 then shown from June to August and then started again in January? Network issues? Whats the deal here? I heard few people say that the full ""season 2"" is actually season 2 and 3 together, as in season 2 was the June-August episodes and season 3 is this January-February window.

However, on the other side Harvey also got pretty emotional in terms of calming Mike down/silencing him. So today I got to thinking and I remembered Harvey doesn't drive, and tried pretty hard to tapper Mike away from the DUI case. My question/thought is what is the plausibility that Harvey doesn't drive anymore because he once (got into a drunk driving incident) where he so happened to kill Mike's parents swearing him to no longer drive again? Now I don't remember everything perfectly, but did Harvey ever say why he doesn't drive (maybe other than he doesn't like it) or do we know who the person was that killed Mike's parents and what happened to him? 

tl;dr: Is Havey's unwillingness to drive perhaps because when he was younger he had a DUI in which he killed Mike's parents and he has been hiding the secret all along

I got to thinking as to why.

In my opinion USA doesnt want to keep its top rated shows together, its not good business. In tv you are better off pairing a weaker rating or new show with one with strong ratings and a loyal fanbase. For that reason Suits will now be teamed up with a weaker rated show for that shows benefit to hopefully improve its ratings. Much like Suits was originally teamed with USA's headline show Burn Notice, Suits has quickly graduated from being the newbie to being one of the big guns in USA's summer lineup.

They went from legal genius to pure drama (Mike and Rachel) then they mixed them perfectly in this last episode!!!
The second episode of the series, with the satellite phone was all about legal genius. Then they somehow devolved into purely drama, focusing mainly on Mike and Rachel's relationship. But now they've found the perfect mix of drama and law stuff.
So I agree with [1] [cjap2011's](http://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/wurhg/noooooooooooooo/c5gmw60) prediction that the whole situation is a ploy from Hardman. BUT it does several things as well.

* It opens up the cast for a new character.


Suits has great characters all throughout, and I'm excited to see who they use to fill the role of Harvey's secretary. If Donna comes back, there's certainly a position somewhere in the firm that this person could fill, possibly making them a permanent addition to the show.

* We get to explore Harvey and Donna as characters

They're both always right, but now they're both vulnerable. We get to see a human, flawed version of them, which is great. And, because they're not working together, we get to explore the love interest.

* Bring back ""Mike and Rachel""

Because of the parallels between ""Harvey and Donna"" and ""Mike and Rachel,"" if the writers explore the former couple, then the latter will notice and perhaps pursue eachother, or at least the tension will build back up.

* Big season finale of a HUGE WIN

By taking down Hardman and Tanner when the fraud blows up in their faces.

First, Scottie's U.K. firm helped Pearson tremendously with the Folsom Foods case, and one of the reason they helped was for the merger. Second, this help exposed Hardman and protect Pearson from him. Third, Jessica reasoning for the merger is logically sound that it would provide more financial muscle to Pearson, and give the company a broader international scope. And lastly Harvey is promised to have his name on the company wall. Also it seems like most of the senior partner are agreeing with it. 
The argument for him against it seems pretty weak. It's not really diluting the company, when the firm becomes stronger. The only major argument is that they weren't straight forward with Harvey about the merger, and he felt left out in the decision making. "	t5_2s5j7	True

Louis/Frank/Charles however, are my favourite type of character. They're outwardly difficult to like as they are cowardly and deeply self involved. But, the combination of their insecurities and technical skill makes them underdogs rather than petty, annoying minor villains. They have their moments that reveal they 

Louis is a lot more Winchester in this respect, since they are extremely skilled in their respective areas; Louis in financial crime, Charles in thoracic surgery/pediatrics. At some point, the series 'hero' (Harvey, Hawkeye) has to defer to their expertise. They all respect one another, but they're all still at odds.

Are there any characters like Louis? I can only think of one right now, and that's Rimmer from Red Dwarf. He's cowardly, self important and stupid in the most astounding of ways, but he lacks the 'technically skilled' aspect..."	t5_2s5j7	True

How awesome would it be for the start of episode one to be Hardman pulling some devious trick. Let's say Louis' Harvard associate that he was forced to fire tells some ""lies"" about Mike Ross and the firm and Louis actually follows through on his threat? Donna innocently provides Louis with something and is arrested in the fallout as an accessory.

Louis is arrested and the shaky firm is blown apart by the scandal, meanwhile Hardman's last words foreshadowed that the Harvard associate spilled the beans on Mike Ross and the reckoning is coming.

Zane comes after Pearson and Harvey and we see partners coming in to resign, jumping ship as the firm crumbles around them. Mike is arrested for practicing law without a license and Rachel tells him off forever. Harvey is torn between defending Donna from the accessory charge and protecting himself from the lies he's told to protect Mike.

As the final episode comes to a close we see workers taking down the ""Pearson"" sign at the office, Louis' sentence is read and he breaks down realizing what a waste it all was, Mike is shown in a cell looking oddly like his apartment with his old scumbag roomate to keep him company and comment on how it all finally caught up with him. Jessica is shown being lead away in cuffs as Harvey walks out of the courthouse looking dazed as for the first time in his life he couldn't fix everything. The obvious unanswered questions of what happened to Donna and how Harvery is free to go are left floating as we consider the house of cards can really come falling down on anyone."	t5_2s5j7	True
