Edit: workmate returned not long ago. He was close to the action as it started, near the stairs leading up to the mall (close to Roger David area I think). Said that once the few police there had figured out what was going on a civillian (guessing maybe the undercover guy in sehl's photo) was pushing people around making them respond and get out. There weren't enough police to cordon off the area so my colleague and a few others went down the mall shooing people out of the mall as police got it under control.
  
Edit 2: from /u/dirtysnachez 12:44 - 2 shots fired, apparently captured and alive.  
from /u/dreamingtree - witness on ABC 24 saying that bloke was dropped, blood on his arm and shoulder, pinned down by the cops, ambos checking him out now. On a stretcher and able to stand up. Crisis over."	t5_2qutz	True

I just went through a breakup, and I've really only got a few actual friends. Thought this was a good spot to put something like this. Throwaway for identifying info.

I'm a 25y/o male and I live in the inner west of Brisbane by myself. I have a degree that I don't use, while working in the offices of a transport company. I follow and play basketball, but have an ok knowledge and interest is other sports. I game a little, don't mind a few beers, and the odd tree. I work a regular 8 - 4 in the CBD, and own a car. I prefer a pub over clubs, but a occasional night out has it's place. I like your standard TV and movie selection, but that's a bit broad to elaborate on here, and tend to burn through stuff a season at a time.

So yeah. If anyone is in a similar spot, or has a group with a vacancy, shoot me a PM. I'm aware this reads like something from a dating website, but that's ok, just think friends instead.

1356217512.0	15ato5	FOUND: GoPro Hero 3 underwater camera		109	14	32	"Hey reddit,

I went swimming up the coast on Friday, and while milling around in the surf I felt something smooth at my feet. I reached down, picked it up and it was an underwater camera. The model was a GoPro Hero 3.

Now, this camera was still recording and had dozens of pictures on the memory card of the guy who owns it and his family. I'd really like to get it back to him because I'd be pretty sad if I lost something this nice in the surf, especially around Xmas.

So here we go:

[This is the man who owns the camera](http://imgur.com/BHi49)

[This is a stock image of the type of camera](http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2012/10/GoProHero3.jpg)

I also put an ad on [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/mooloolaba/lost-found/found-gopro-hero-3-underwater-camera/1011347928)

If you know who this man is, put him in contact with me either on here or on the gumtree link above.

EDIT: Because it is an expensive camera I'm sure there are some internet dickheads who are looking to score a freebie. Rest assured I'm planning to ask him some questions to verify his identity, so internet dickheads: don't even try.

EDIT2: Found at Mooloolaba, at a beach around [here](https://maps.google.com.au/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.dGY&amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1093&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+spit+sunshine+coast&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=au&amp;hq=the+spit&amp;hnear=0x6b937fb66d7d48ed:0x302a35af3deaf50,Sunshine+Coast+QLD&amp;cid=0,0,13537740702293602770&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MYHWUPe2LeWNiAfc0YGwBA&amp;ved=0CJIBEPwSMAA)"	t5_2qutz	True

1358222231.0	16livu	Hey all - I need your help ASAP. I need to locate an LGBTI Liaison police officer either today or tomorrow to report a gay bashing.		117	27	58	"The title pretty much sums it up. A little bit of background though - I was the victim of a homophobic attacker at a friend's small movie night on Friday last week, and he attacked me twice because I told him in a calm manner that his constant use of 'that's so gay' and 'faggot' was a bit offensive. He bashed me once, was pulled away, demanded that I accept his apology and that I should be grateful he didn't kill me, I told him to go away and leave me alone, and he came after me again - he bashed through a window and almost the back door to try and get at me. I want to press charges of assault and I think I could make the most of this situation by talking to an officer that has more familiarity with these kinds of issues. 

Apparently there's a LGBTI liaison officer in Logan Central but since that's Woodridge, they'll probably be all tied up with the gang riots at the moment. Does anyone know where there would be an officer I could speak to in the Logan or Brisbane south/central areas? I'd appreciate any help :)

EDIT: Seeing an LGBTI Liaison officer on Thursday afternoon and she seems very friendly and understanding - hopefully we can work together to make sure this asshole doesn't do this to someone else who dares to stand up to him.

Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow.

They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,

They fell with their faces to the foe.

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:

Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.

At the going down of the sun and in the morning,

We will remember them.

---

I hope you all have a wonderful day, whether it is spent munching on Anzac cookies, paying respect to the dead, going to the beach or having a feast. Days like this remind us of why Australia is a magnificent country. I attended the Dawn Service this morning, which was incredible. It was so great to see such a large crowd and to see all of the men and women in their uniforms. It seemed fitting that it was such a beautiful sunrise this morning, to conclude a beautiful ceremony. So if you can, spare a thought for the men who died at such places as Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneux. Lest we forget. 

Edit: I've been watching Today's coverage of Anzac Day and there was a moment that really struck me. It was two veterans of Kokoda explaining their thoughts on war and facing the enemy. George, one of the veterans, said something rather profound (paraphrased), ""I don't hate the enemy. I think those who hate are always more unhappy than the hated."" Great words that I think we can all apply to our own lives. 

Isn't Anzac day such a good day for reflection? Cheers."	t5_2qutz	True

1332146843.0	r38i5	How preferences work - your guide to kicking arse at the polling booth this Saturday		82	15	17	"Good day /r/Brisbane! Since we're all off to the polls this weekend I thought I'd post a little something about how our preferential voting system works. I've come across many people who, despite being otherwise informed and engaged regarding politics, do not understand how preferences work, and end up voting in a way not in alignment with their own desires. **This information is most relevant to people wanting to vote for minor parties.** If you 100% just want to vote Labor or LNP, you can stop reading now. Your vote will be counted exactly as you think it will be. Too easy!

---

**Point 1: You should ALWAYS vote for the party you actually want to vote for**

&gt; If I vote for a party like The Sex Party or (god forbid) The Shooter's Party, what effect does that have? I keep hearing that it just goes either Labor or Liberal anyway.

** Voting 1 for your favourite party makes them money**. If they exceed a certain percentage of the vote (I believe 4% in Qld state elections), they get money from the Electoral Commission for each vote that exceeds that threshold (I believe $1/vote). This applies in federal and state elections, but not council elections.

A less concrete effect is to send a message to the major parties that you support the message of your minor party of choice.

As for your vote ""just going to Labor or Liberal"", **that depends entirely on where ***you*** choose to direct ***your*** preferences**. Are you like my cousin and normally vote Green, but don't want to help re-elect the Labor party this time around? Vote 1 Green, 2 Liberal. Your vote will not help the ALP *in the slightest*. You normally vote LNP, but think Bob Katter might the go? Vote 1 Bob, 2 LNP. Your vote will not help the ALP *in the slightest*. Your mate Robbo is running as an independent, you want to help him but you'd really rather just vote Labor? Vote 1 Robbo, 2 Labor. Your vote will not go to Campbell Newman, not one little bit.

**Point 2: Voting for a third party will NEVER help your least favourite major party, so long as you give your favourite major party a higher preference.**

---

Now, onto the mechanics of how this all works. All the number 1 votes are counted first. If a candidate has more than 50% of the 1 votes, they win that seat. If not, the candidate with the lowest vote is eliminated. Each ballot paper that had the eliminated candidate down as number 1 is then inspected, and that vote is transferred **(at full value)** to the candidate with a number 2 next to their name. Then the process begins again - if a candidate has more than 50% of the combined number 1 and transferred votes, they win. If not, the candidate with the next lowest votes is eliminated, their ballot papers inspected and votes transferred to the candidate with number 2 next to their name. If the number 2 candidate has previously been eliminated, the vote is transferred to the number 3 candidate, etc. This process continues until someone gets at least 50% + 1 vote, at which point that candidate is declared the winner. 

**Point 3: In practise what this means is that if you vote for a minor party, your vote will most likely end up being transferred to the major party you've given the highest preference to.** 

This is not a built-in feature of the system, it's a side effect of Labor or Liberal always getting the most votes so always being the last parties to be eliminated. So to go back to the example of my cousin, if you want to vote Green but would prefer a Liberal member over a Labor one, vote 1 Green, 2 Liberal. Your vote will earn the Greens a dollar, but will ultimately be transferred *at full value* to the Liberal party. You like Labor but like the Sex Party more? Vote 1 Sex, 2 Labor. A dollar for the Sex Party, a full value vote transferred to Labor.

---

**Point 4: It is still possible for third party candidates to be elected to parliament!**

If a Greens or Katter Party or whoever candidate can get 50%+ of the primary and transferred votes, **they will be elected to parliament**. Take the example of the seat of Melbourne at the last federal election. The Liberal Party candidate had fewer primary votes than both the Labor candidate and the Greens candidate (Adam Bandt). For this reason, the Liberal candidate was eliminated, and all the 1 Liberal votes were transferred to other candidates. Enough of these votes were transferred to Adam Bandt for him to get 50%+ of the vote and win the seat. That's right, **Adam Bandt of the Greens was elected thanks to Liberal Party preferences**. 

---

**Point 5: In Qld state elections, you don't have to direct preferences at all! (But it's probably a good idea to do it anyway)**

If you're so disgusted with both major parties that the thought of your vote being transferred to them makes you recoil in horror, you can simply vote 1 for your desired candidate, without listing preferences. If your candidate is eliminated in the vote count, your vote will ""expire"" - that is, it will not be transferred. In practice though this can have unintended consequences. Lets say that in some electorate, the LNP get 40%, Labor get 35% and the Greens get 25%. If every single one of those Greens voters did not give a preference, all 25% of those votes would expire, leaving the Labor and LNP candidates as the last two standing. Because the LNP got the most votes of the two final candidates, they would win the seat, despite having 60% of the people in that seat vote against them.

One of you had encouraged me to share some other reviews of things I've eaten which I have enjoyed, so I thought I'd fly through a few of them in brief, and ask you, in return, to share your favourites as well.

*A note about my credibility as a foodie: I weigh 100 kilos. Is that credible enough for you?*

Anyway, here goes...

**Breakfast Stuff**

I'm not an eggs guy, and don't really get off on fancy breakfast stuff (quiches, for example), so take that into account on this list

* Bagel Boys bagels (onion and garlic flavours, in particular) - These are available at Sourced Grocer in Teneriffe and the Jan Power markets (Queen St Mall Wednesdays, Powerhouse second and fourth Saturdays). I prefer mine toasted with butter, but have been known to use the panini press in my office's kitchen to flatten them out a little bit to enhance the chewiness. I should note that good bagels should be chewy, and the Bagel Boys are as good as it gets here in Qld. 

* Kabana and cheese with BBQ sauce on a day-old sesame bun - I get these from this takeaway on the corner of Mary and Edward in the CBD (on Mary, between the place with the sushi and the news agency), and this afterthought of a breakfast half-sandwich really does it for me, for some reason. I even like how the day-old roll's semi-stale texture works for this sandwich.

* Volcanos - Got these takeaway from Jocelyn's Provisions on James Street. They're a roll topped with baked Swiss cheese, filled with bacon gruyere potatoes au gratin. I ate them at room temperature and loved them, but next time I'm going to try to get them right out of the oven. The cheese is going to burn the shit out of the roof of my mouth, but I'm betting I won't care at all.

**Lunch In The CBD**

* My favourite is the chicken karaage (kaarage?) bento box from Nagomi at Eagle Street Pier. Fried chicken, rice (which I usually get with the curry sauce), gyoza, edamame, salad, croquettes. All of it tasty, and usually no more than a three minute wait from ordering.

* Jia Jiang noodles - Fantasia (Macarthur Central, Wintergarden) does these. It's a vermicelli noodle topped with a semi-spicy pork mince gravy, topped with fresh cucumber. Big portion for $9, too.

* Little Saigon's Banh Mi - they call them ""baguettes"" on the menu, but when you get the traditional style, it's a ""banh mi."" Roast pork and a fried spam-like product along with a pork pate represent the meats, carrot, cucumber and coriander represent the vegetable. I usually get chili on it too, along with the Vietnamese-style BBQ sauce. All of this on a crusty French roll. Banh mi sandwiches are the best. There's a new place in a laneway between Charlotte and Queen just north of Post Office Square called ""The Roll"" which is doing these as well. I had one yesterday and it was good.

**Other Stuff**

* Sundays at Yardbird Ale House in the Valley they do ""Sunday Crafternoons,"" featuring a different food menu and $5 schooners (28 Pale from Burleigh on tap, which makes me happy). I highly recommend the cheeseburger from these guys. It's greasy goodness, and probably the closest thing to an American pub-style burger I've had in a long time (thick patty, all beef with no filler - Grill'd and Burger Urge are very much an Aussie-style burger you don't see in the US, and BYOB in Newstead isn't at all as good as Yardbird's). I also recommend the steak sandwich off the regular Yardbird menu. It's got a caramelized onion relish on it that's juicy like gravy and makes the whole damn thing delicious (not to mention the steak itself is thick enough to actually represent some pink inside, which was nice).

* Bitter Suite in New Farm (I like craft beer) has these beef cheek gravy chips with gruyere cheese melted over top that I really, really liked. The chips were thick potato wedges, so the dish really has some substance. So good.

* Pork buns from the guy at Jan Power Powerhouse markets who sets up next to Bagel Boys - holy crap. These things have a juicy, saucy pork meatball steamed inside of a pillowy bun. I went back for seconds last week. Been told they are not superior to the ones at Happy Little Dumplings on James St (and in Bulimba), so I'm definitely going to have to give those a try.

* Pho at West End Gardens in West End - if you've not had pho, go get some goddamn pho. West End Gardens is my favourite, so far (had it at AJ's in the CBD, The Vietnamese, PhoB, that upscale Vietnamese joint across from PhoB, and at that place by The Vietnamese in the Valley whose name is escaping me - Hoang Gia?). So very delicious, and perfect for wintertime.

WHAT SAY YOU REST OF R/BRISBANE?

**Step 3** - Open Google earth on your phone and zoom in relatively close to your desired location (it tends to crash if viewing at a large scale)

**Step 4** - Open the Google Drive app, and click on seq_transit.kmz.  This will load the transit layer in Earth.

**Step 5** - Touch your stop of choice.  This will provide a hyperlink.  Click on the hyperlink and view the latest timetable info for that stop.

**Step 6** - Enjoy!

This is the same feed as what you see on electronic timetables around Brisbane.

You can also download the full transit file from [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWgqo4o2LWDVUNLWGR0SGxPYUk/edit?usp=sharing).  This includes full route information.  It's unlikely that this will work on your mobile but it should load fine on your PC.

If seq_transit.kmz is too large for your phone to deal with, try [this file](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWgqo4o2LWDNXU5RlpuQklxajA/edit?usp=sharing) instead - it's a smaller file that covers most of Brisbane.

I was trying to get it to work in Google maps but it appears the mobile version of maps simply can't handle this amount of information.  Hat's off to anyone that can put this together in a nice user friendly app!

Is anyone in a position to AND interested in adopting a kitty cat? This poor fellow - http://imgur.com/NBV9x -, probably around 1-2 years old, has been roaming around our neighbourhood (Kangaroo Point) for the last few weeks, yowling (mating calls) all night and upsetting our cats quite a bit with a few encounters through the screen doors and spraying all around our house. He was probably dumped or abandoned. We eventually caught him last night and my partner who is a Vet has taken him to work today and she has confirmed he has no microchip and is giving him a few health checks (FIV test etc). Being male and not a kitten, not many shelters would be interested in him, and those that would be are full. He is actually quite friendly, cute and affectionate, and would probably make a nice pet once de-sexed and receiving some proper care. We can probably organise de-sexing if we can find him a new home. Note: His sore nose is from injuring it on the cat carrier he had to live inside last night. 

Let me know if you think you can help or know someone who might be able to!

**UPDATE!** My partner de-sexed him today and has tested negative to FIV. We will also vaccinate him when we find him a home. "	t5_2qutz	True

1370231804.0	1fk74y	Looking for donor milk in Brisbane.	nymmeh	74	16	16	"A little bit of back story:

I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma when I was 20 weeks pregnant. We successfully induced our daughter at 32 weeks. She spent a month in the RBWH special care before we brought her home. I am very determined to breast feed. I started to express as soon as she was born, after being told that it would be safe for me to breast feed her 6 weeks after my last dose of chemo. 
I have been sourcing and feeding her donor breast milk since birth.
Unfortunately, the chemo and radiation have taken their toll on my ability to lactate, and I am constantly looking for milk donors.

Requirements: 

Due to breast milk being a bodily fluid, I have to ask that donors have  a blood test to check for a few diseases that pass through breast milk.
I also have bottles for storage, though breast milk storage bags work too.

Edit: thanks for everyone's well wishes and the up votes! 
I have been sourcing donors through Human Milk 4 Human Babies. 
The RBWH Milk Bank only feeds prem bubs to 34 weeks.
The Mothers Milk Bank costs around $500 a week to feed bub. (It's not for profit, but costs a lot to process etc.)
Of course I considered formula, I weighed the risks between formula and donor breast milk and chose the later. I am also not an idiot, I am not going to let my child go hungry."	t5_2qutz	True

[http://www.olgr.qld.gov.au/consumers/underageDrinking/Identification/index.shtml](http://www.olgr.qld.gov.au/consumers/underageDrinking/Identification/index.shtml)

My mate recently got his perfectly legitimate ID taken from him at X&amp;Y bar in the valley, and they couldn't give him a receipt to prove they have it.  In the meantime, he can't:

* drive
* do banking at a branch
* check in luggage on domestic flights
* enter licensed premises

Or anything that requires ID.  There's no timelines listed on the gov't site as to when he'll get it back, and it doesn't state when the bar has to send it to them for the investigation.

I had no idea we have this law in Queensland; I wouldn't mind if the police were called down to check it out but they said they're powerless to do anything.

Brisbane city rates notices have just come out. 

I'm on my 2nd home now but last rates notice I sat down to pay a stack of bills via internet banking. I was working thru them pretty quickly so I grabbed the rates notice and paid the green amount.

It was only a week later that I looked again (not in such a rush) and saw that I had donated $15 to the city hall reconstruction. 

That is most definitely not something that I wish my charity money to go towards.  I never go into the city, I don't work there and it generally annoys the crap out of me out being in there.  I would choose to donate to RSPCA etc. I couldn't give a rats about some old building that I never ever see. 

I rang up and reversed the 'contribution' and have just received my money back. (3 months later)

I think it's quite sneaky and underhanded of BCC to make the final total amount, highlighted in green, as the amount including a donation to city hall restoration.

Edit- Car found!!!! On winstanley st near the bulimba creek bridge! Will update later once I speak to cops.  

Second Edit - Tuesday Night -
Apologies for hiding the post - I didn't want it cramming up the front page. Here's the story:
I was at work in the city an got a call from my parents that our house had been broken into in Carindale. They had only arrived home shortly before so didn't have time to take inventory. My personal car was missing out of the garage though.
On my bus road home from work at 5:30pm, I saw the car parked in plain sight along a busy road in Carindale that the bus goes along (in fact, all buses going to Carindale heights, it's probably one of the busiest roads in the suburb after Old Celeveland). I jumped off the bus immediately (forgot to swipe the go-card, d'oh) and waited with my car while my parents brought down the spare keys, and a pair of latex gloves the police (now at the house) had given them. The car was locked, and the keys were gone. It makes absolutely 0 sense for them to park where they did in such plain sight, unless they wanted the car to be found.
The car drove just fine back home - no dents or anything, there was nothing of value left in it at all, and it was, except for the seat being moved back and the radio turned off, totally untouched.
Of the things stolen from the house, it makes no sense - they took a digital camera and an ipod touch, but left all laptops (with the exception of a gawd awful netbook I never even use), expensive looking watches and most jewelry. The strangest thing they stole was a dustbuster, along with charger??
So glad to have my car back, and insurance process is already starting for the stolen goods. Thanks for those who upvoted it to the front page. Thanks!

This guy [Grant](http://grantthepoliteguy.blogspot.com) runs a blog about being homeless in Brisbane. I live in the UK so can't really do more than donate (which I've done) but he's organising a BBQ for local homeless people and needs funding / people. Some dudes just tried to screw him over the by the sounds of his [recent blog post](http://grantthepoliteguy.blogspot.com/2011/07/beaming-with-pride.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Grant-ThePoliteGuy+%28Grant+-+the+Polite+Guy%29) so I figure he could do with a boost.

Apologies if this dude is already a local celebrity and you all know about him - someone here on reddit actually pointed me in the direction of his site. Just figured some of you locals might be interested in helping him out somehow, sounds like what he's doing is right up reddit's street."	t5_2qutz	True

There's the guy in Queen Street Mall who wanders around in between Hungry Jacks and The Pig and Whistle wearing a business suit and shouting insanities in a strange accent. Occasionally he's got a bag on his head with a question mark on it. Anyone know the guy?

There's also a homeless(I assume) guy with short blondish tightly curled hair who often wears a dress while marching around purposefully singing top-40 hits.
After one encounter with this guy in which we discussed the Tekken series for about 30 minutes he told me to ""Call him Prototype Alyssa"" and then danced away singing lady gaga.

Then theres all the buskers, I've never really had a chance to talk to half of them, anyone got any info on the old guy who plays sax all day every day?

Unfortunately for me there was rail works on the Ipswich line.  I went down to the bus pick up point hoping to catch a bus or a provided taxi service.  
I sat at the stop a good 10 minutes as I watched 3-4 buses pull up and then leave before I realised that there would be no service provided to me whatsoever.  So I contacted a cab company to come and pick me up, but being a Sunday, service was extremely bad and I spent a further hour waiting to be collected as I watched people be shuttle away in front of me.  
In all I wasted a good 2 hours of my day because there was no alternative travel option available for me. 
Translink failed to provide me adequate service that day and if there was an alternative travel company, you most certainly would have lost my business.

Time for all the brisredditors to come out to Kangaroo Point, meet eachother and break some bread.

Like last year, we will meet in the part of the park with BBQs and the public art thing (represented on Google Maps as a [construction zone](http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Kangaroo+Point,+Queensland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-27.475679,153.035742&amp;spn=0.001987,0.004117&amp;sll=-32.010396,135.119128&amp;sspn=109.328412,269.824219&amp;oq=kangaroo+p&amp;hnear=Kangaroo+Point+Queensland&amp;t=h&amp;z=19)). People will be there from 10am. Don't forget to bring:

* Food. There are BBQs at the site. Make sure you bring enough for yourself, plus a bit more to go around. Sharing is caring!

* Warm things. It can get kinda breezy in June on the top of the cliffs.

* Pets. We had a few dogs show up last year. As long as your pets aren't likely to start fights, feel free to bring them! (They will need to stay on leashes, though.)

* Mobile Reddit device. There will be a thread on the day in which early arrivers can share information about our precise location.

* Games. Other reddit meets have been graced with: Twister, Mad Libs, and some game where we sat in a circle and killed eachother. 

* Cameras. Because evidence.

* Photo ID. If you're over 18, most of /r/Brisbane's gatherings end in a pub.

As you can all see from the photos in the sidebar, we usually get a pretty good turn out at these events. This year, make sure you're a part of it! "	t5_2qutz	True

This is a wild shot in the dark, but today I was walking home and this cute girl pulled her car over, asked if I was going to a bus stop nearby and offered me a lift. I was literally a block from home already so, after a brief convo, I declined.

No idea what inspired you to pull over and chat with me, cute girl, but afterwards I found myself wishing I had thought to get your phone number. The whole scenario just caught me off guard. So yeah, thanks for the random act of kindness and if you'd like to get in touch with the guy wearing the blue dodgers cap you met in Sunnybank Hills this afternoon, PM me!

I know there's bugger all chance of me every getting to anywhere near his smooth lithe twisting... but just to get comfortable with moving my body in a similar fashion would be great.

I'm obviously after private lessons - I'm too worried about looking like a goose. 

Happy to pay cash... better for my anonymity!

Edit: As TheAllosaurus has pointed out... this does sound highly dubious!  
So to help anyone feel safe - I'm happy to meet in a nice public place - you check my license details, work number, etc, etc before any lessons! And I'll even give you my other reddit name - I just didn't want the great unwashed masses to get hold of it and be forever tagged ""Elderly Magic Mike"" or something similar :[

**When?** Saturday, June 23rd @ 11am

**Where?** Kangaroo Point Cliffs (at the very top - it's close to the toilets and grass with lots of room for activities,  we won't clog the pathway and it's also close to ice-cream at the end)

&gt; A TOTAL smoking ban in the Queen Street Mall will take effect from the first day of Spring. 
&gt;Lord Mayor Graham Quirk will announce that September 1 will herald the start of a smoke-free mall which was first flagged by his predecessor Campbell Newman last November.

&gt; Under the ban, smokers will face a $200 fine if they are caught lighting up in the mall.

&gt; Up to 900,000 people frequent the mall each week and a 2010 survey found 80 per cent of respondents supported a total smoking ban in the shopping strip.

&gt; Cr Quirk will provide further details at a press conference with representatives of the Australian Medical Association and the Queensland Cancer Council.

It's great to see it finally pushed through, but considering they only fine about 200 people state wide every year under the current smoking laws, I can't see they'll enforce this very much after the first few weeks.  "	t5_2qutz	True

We are a bunch of Engineering students at QUT who have built a 3D Printer for one of our projects and now would like to bring our service to anyone in Brisbane.

We provide a Rapid Prototyping service offering a cheap alternative to many professionals with design services also on offer.

Our print resolutions are capable of up to .05mm to .025mm in the Z axis, the X/Y being so high that detail is measured by the nanometer.

Pricing are 10c per gram of material, $1/hr for the print to complete and sometimes a negotiated fee for our time to design or adjust a design(we can 3d scan as well). This pricing range is set to change to reflect our goals of covering costs better and expansion, as of yet we have no plans to make a serious profit, this is not something to 'pay the rent'. 
An example print might be the 180mm tall Venus de Milo statue replica I have printed for many people, under the existing pricing, this would come to around 15 dollars.

I've been here for almost 9 days now, and I move into my apartment tomorrow in Auchenflower - so I'm pretty excited! I've already found some Viet places in Inala to sooth my Pho craving, done the obligatory shop at IKEA (but steered clear of Logan as warned) and got right onto getting a GO card!

I can't believe the transport system here compared to Sydney, considering you're 1/4 the size in population (if memory serves me correct) - yet it seems your buses and the few trains I've been on are far easier to navigate - and electronic ticketing!!! ahhhh it's not just something I can experience when abroad now!

No luck in the graduate positions - as they do the intakes a year in advance, meaning I can still apply - but it won't be till next year I get in! So I'm still in the hunt for a job, might have to pull some beers in the coming weeks until something opens up!

Thanks again for all the advice, and I'm hoping to organising a meetup somewhere - at a pub or where ever - once I've settled into my new place and hopefully have a steady flow of income!

* Don’t drink liquids that contain alcohol or large amounts of sugar.

* Stay indoors and, if at all possible, stay in an air-conditioned place.

* Electric fans may provide comfort, but when the temperature is in the high, fans will not prevent heat-related illness. Try taking a cool shower or bath.

* Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.

* NEVER leave anyone or any animal in a closed, parked vehicle.

* Check regularly on:
  * Infants and young children
  * People aged 65 or older
  * People who have a mental illness
  * Those who are physically ill

 .

**If you must be out in the heat:**

* Limit your outdoor activity to morning and evening hours.

* Cut down on exercise. If you must exercise, drink two to four glasses of cool, nonalcoholic fluids each hour.

* Try to rest often in shady areas.

* Protect yourself from the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat (also keeps you cooler) and sunglasses and by putting on sunscreen

1357482017.0	1627bd	Does anybody have any odd jobs they need done?	ElvisLikeBear	47	11	31	"Unfortunately my family is hard up against the wall - we lost my dad and his partner (of, what we now know only four months) is making a claim against his estate. This means we can't sell Dad's house whilst it's in dispute (not certain of this until we talk to a lawyer but this is what a few people have told us... I'm hoping it's not true) and have two mortgages to cover (mum's house and dad's farm). Needless to say - mum can't afford this and on top of this we have a lot of upcoming legal bills to fight this (she's claiming defacto of two years and has already emptied dad's house when we weren't there... a long story).

I'm helping mum out but my finances are already completely stretched so I need a second job. What I do have is a truck, full of tools (dad did some home handyman work - It's fully stocked and I think I should be able to use this). A hard work ethic and a willingness to do anything.

With that in mind - are there any jobs people need done? It would have be after 5pm / weekends but I'll do anything from mowing to cleaning toilets to giving you a lift home from the pub - just throw it at me along with what you'd pay for it (I'd like to charge $40/hour but I'm still working this out). I will do anything. If I can't do it I'll bring a friend who knows how (know a lot of tradesman willing to help me through this) - I will be honest with you if that is the case.

I'd also value any insights people have in how I can market myself with this. This won't be something I'll do forever so I don't have much incentive to invest any capital (nor anything to really invest) but until mum has sorted the legal side of this horrible mess out I need to give her everything I can.

Seriously - throw it at me. Happy to provide my number via pm if you would like to discuss further."	t5_2qutz	True

Some of you may not like me posting this here but I'm getting desperate so here goes.
 
My car was stolen Friday Night/Saturday morning, most likely between the hours of 10PM on Friday night and 6AM Saturday morning.
The car was always parked in my driveway at the intersection of Old Cleveland Road and Main Avenue Coorparoo, I imagine some of you even drive past it most mornings.
It was quite low on fuel, so I'm hoping they've stopped at a servo somewhere close by before disappearing, I will be asking the local servo's if they have seen anything.

It is a two-tone (gold on grey) Nissan S13 Silvia, Manual. 

Those wheels are Work Emotion XT7's 17"" x 9"" +22 offset, 5x114.3 PCD (These wheels are rare in this size and offset)

It had a hang-toy on the back, opposite the exhaust.

If you have seen it, know anything about, or just seen some garages go dodgy, please let the police and myself know. I look here regularly.
At this point, as I doubt insurance will cover me, I will offer a reward for information leading to the vehicle being returned to me.

As a result, I've grown to love my new Wednesday habit of visiting the Jan Power Markets at Queen Street Mall for both breakfast and lunch. Here's a few highlights for the takeaway food, if you're not a regular visitor like me:

**Breakfast** - I almost always stop for a bagel (onion or garlic, toasted and buttered - the savoury ones are better, trust me) at Bagel Boys stand, which is near the back on the main aisle down the middle. They've got a few sandwiches they put together too, but I'm pretty simple in my bagel selection. I would add that if you take away a few garlic bagels you can make mini pizzas during the week that taste just damn delicious. Toast the bagel with some butter first, then add your sauce and cheese and bake.

In addition to Bagel Boys, I'll often grab a pork bun from the guys at Steamed Dim Sim, who are there every other week. They also have a storefront on Turbot between Roma and George (across from the police station). The pork bun has a ginger shallot pork meatball inside, which is a nice change of pace from the BBQ pork featured in most other meatballs. Their dumplings are terrific, too. Dave and his business partner (I forget his name) are good guys who are succeeding in putting out a consistently excellent product, even if it ultimately means focusing on doing just a few things really well (three varieties of dumplings and a pork bun - that's their menu).

**Lunch** - While I visit Steamed from time to time for lunch instead of breakfast, I usually stop by the Vietnamese stand called ""The Rice Hut."" Their banh mi is damn fine, and they'll roll those rice paper rolls right in front of you for takeaway too. It's a little more expensive than what you'll find at other Vietnamese joints in town (for example, the banh mi at the Vietnamese at the top of the escalators in Myer Center by the bottle-o is $5, theirs is $9), but the quality is excellent. Tell Jeannine and Jeannette (why their mom named lookalike sisters like this is beyond me, but one or both will be there) that the American guy Anthony sent you. Good people, good product.

Kate's Vegetarian stand (I think it's Kate's) has good product too. Bean or lentil salads, mostly, served in a box topped with hummous and a falafel. They do good work with their flavours, and I'll pick up some stuff from them as a change of pace from my banh mi. Added bonus: there's a really attractive six foot tall woman who has that nerdy girl look like the actress Judy Greer from Arrested Development who works there. She's married, but still.

Cornish Pasty Man does nice work. I like the original with some hot sauce (chili sauce of the Mexican variety) on it, though the curry one is good too. They'll let you take some home for your freezer and they bake up nice.

Everyone knows about German Sausage Hut, right? They're right on the George Street front of the market, and their pig roast sandwich with crackling is nice. 

Lastly, I'm a big fan of the pretzel from the German baker who sets up right next to German Sausage Hut. $3, but it's soft and tasty.

THIS WEEK FRIDAY IS **GOOD FRIDAY**


Good Friday is the one day of the year when things open '364 days a year' will be shut.

If you are going to a party or a BBQ over the weekend, if you usually do your grocery shopping on a friday, if you eat takeaway food on fridays, THINGS WILL BE SHUT.

Petrol is going to be more expensive.  If money is tight, make sure you don't have to fill your tank over the coming weekend.

Buy your alcohol and sausages on THURSDAY because trying to do it on Friday will be a fruitless exercise.  You'll be able to get bacon and eggs at crazy prices from 7-11s and corner shops but that's about it.

If you live in the central area, get your Easter eggs and treats before Wednesday because by Thursday the shelves are bare and you'll have to venture out towards the suburbs - and I know the central-dwellers aren't cool with that.

If you buy drugs, your dealer will likely be out of town.  Camping.  With family.  And hating it.  GONE!  Get that quarter BEFORE THURSDAY!


**BE PREPARED FOR THE LAST REMNANT OF SERIOUS RELIGION IN OUR SECULAR SOCIETY!  STOCK UP NOW!**


*Good Friday has been a source of much distress to me over the years.  Here's hoping you have a wonderful and well-stocked long weekend!*

A few very quick tips:

* Going to the airport from any station? Buy a new GoCard, ($10 total, 5 deposit/5 credit). Tag on. Tag off. You'll go into negative. Throw away the card. You've just saved yourself somewhere between $5 and $20.

* Travelling more than 3 zones on a single one way bus trip (no connections)?. Tagging off actually will charge you more than ""forgetting"" to tag off. Warning though: This is technically fare evasion, and if you have the unfortunate chance of getting stopped getting off a bus by some Ticket Inspectors, you can be fined.

* Forgot to scan off and are overcharged? Ring 13 12 30. They'll generally refund the first few times you forget.

Some of you may have heard of the tunnel that runs from the bank of the Brisbane river at Kangaroo Point. Today I journeyed through it with a couple of friends and took some photos.

There are lots and lots of bats! You can see me making a face as tons of bats whirl around us. Also there's a fair amount of graffiti! Some of it's quite good. Every now and then there is a shaft leading up to a manhole where we can hear the noises of people going about their day haha.

We ended up coming out somewhere near park road station, but *inside* the fenced off rail area. Some fence climbing skill is required.

For those that this pertains to, or for those that just want to support, due to lack of funding the Brisbane Gender Clinic will likely be shut down soon. It runs one day a week and provides vital services to Brisbane's trans* population. Sex and gender diverse people can access important information about transitioning, sympathetic GPs that have experience with trans* issues, hormone prescriptions, and general support. 

Because it receives no government funding, and the services it offers are mostly free, the Gender Clinic can no longer cope with its caseload. These vital services it offers will no longer be available, and that poses a whole host of problems. Trans* people will be forced to find a GP that understands their situation, psychologists that are helpful and don't follow archaic rules for diagnosis of gender dysphoria, rules such as living full time or coming out to certain people, things that are often uncomfortable and sometimes unsafe for the trans* patient in question. If trans* people cannot access information and hormones to aid in their transition, it is likely that cases of self-diagnosis and self-medication will increase, a dangerous prospect. 

If anyone is trans*, or a part of the community by virtue of knowing or being related to trans* people, please, spread the word and get [this petition signed](http://www.change.org/petitions/save-atsaqbrisbane-gender-clinic), or even donate. Don't let this important service fall by the wayside!"	t5_2qutz	True

I'll post some of the funny/poignant responses to some of the free text field answers later if there's interest

Edit the first: 

**Any final comments on /r/brisbane?**


* A subreddit for tourists. I'm getting sick of the almost daily ""I'm coming to Brisbane, what should I do/know?"" posts when they could easily search or contact Tourism Queensland.

* Less meetup crap.. if I want to meet people I go outside.


* It's fairly quiet, but otherwise the community seems to be awesome.

* tis a silly place

* Less Mana Bar stuff.  The place is shithouse.

* It's awesome. Wouldn't mind more meet ups.

*Less meetups...more meetups.....*

* ""Where to begin, at the start usualy. sorry im bored baked and waiting to get picked up so im rambling. I do this quite a bit you know, rambling that that is. Usualy to myself in word but I know someone may read this, probably not after the first little rant but mabe. If you are reading this HELLO and god bless.
Ha no, god died. He had a wonderful funeral though

*We value your input citizen*

* We need moar content! It's cool that it's not overly busy but I'd like a little bit more going on over in Brisvegas ;)

* Might be nice for someone to do a post for the new year about the meet ups and what happens. I have always seen people organising them and it seems everyone who goes knows each other. I have always been too shy to go because I am not sure if I would be welcomed, (I am sure I would). So maybe just some info and some encouragement for new people feel welcome.

*Less cronyism is always good.*

* More moderators, more content, please!

*Your job not mine &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; The content that is. Just kidding - I'm the sockpuppet for all [/r/brisbane](/r/brisbane) accounts*

* Wharrgarbl. 

*Agreed!*

* I enjoy the subreddit but would like to see it more active, though I have no idea how to achieve that!

* Not enough alphabeat nudes.

*No can do. Nevernude*

* Hats. More hats.

* Please, no politics. Ever.

* Got a friend living in Marrumba Downs and should be visiting within the year. Can't wait to get the Brizzy. The subreddit is brilliant for keeping me up to date with what's going on in the city. Maybe more news stuff and less rental opportunities and garage sales...

* too cliquey and not open to counter points of view. If you're not a left wing unwashed uni student you don't count.

* There's nothing really to say about the content, it, for the most part, doesn't interest me, and many of the folks commenting and submitting don't strike me as people I would ever want to know or speak to regularly. At least some of what goes up is helpful to other people though.

* Yeah it sucks. Just goes to prove how many dumbasses believe in ghosts. I'm just waiting for drunken naked twister with asian hipster chicks meetup.

* meets that don't revolve around alcohol would be good

* fukken sik1 m8

*Verily*

* I want more Gold Coasters to know there's a sub-reddit for them. I'm actually living on the Gold Coast (even though most my weekends are spend in Brisvegas, and I was born in the Mater hospital!), and I'd love to have a bit more of a local approach. Come on, you're 80 clicks away!

* More crazy house party meet ups 

* We need more meet-ups!

* Moerators rock. Especially that PorConflict guy, moderating all the way from London. He kicks arse. He needs to be paid. 

*Nice try, Moe.*

* You guys are so nice :)

* its way better than the fanatical politicism of r/australia

* ""The moderators are super-awesome. All of them.

* -- not a moderator. *

* Honest.

* No.

* It seems like a pretty chill place and ads are never intrusive at all. I don't think there needs to be forced tags or other cumbersome rules and it'll probably be a pain the arse for you to have to enforce for a post once in a blue moon. 

* O pointy birds, o pointy pointy, Anoint my head, anointy-nointy. 

http://i.imgur.com/XJyGY.gif


*Last but not least*

* Before I begin, I'd like to point out that I am Obesely, as I have no reason to hide my opinion from behind a veil of anonymity. I have a little addendum to my responses on 'redditors advertising'. While I'm strongly for *that*, the Mana Bar is not a redditor. It should still be allowed to advertise, but this comment is reflective of my personal distaste for the place (it was meant to be some sort of alcoholic gaming utopia, and all it did was break my heart with its mediocrity; I tried, I really did). Actually, while we're on the topic I guess I am a little pissed off that all the meetups keep having to start or end at the Mana Bar... fuck that shit. NYE: Mana Bar. Again, it's not that great and it really isn't the proper place for discussion (be it silly, or serious) or socialising. My biggest regret is that I didn't go to the Halloween party or the one before that. Those seemed like enjoyable events. The GRMD photo, though... I've said it before, and I'll say it again (being the ugly human being that I am, and judging people by the way they look and dress) that I would only wish to meet half the people in that photo; I had the displeasure of Appleman's company at a social event for a uni club (he wasn't even sitting at my table, but it was a Christmas dinner and he had his purple beret and his laptop out while everyone else was talking and eating... cringeworthy), and I hope never to be in the same room as him again. Some people are just not fun to be around. Apologies if I am sounding like a bit of a cunt (well, I am); it's just part of being honest. If people were truly honest about interactions with people they'd met over reddit, you'd see a lot more responses like mine. 

* As for the moderators, I have no problem with you, and you were pretty good in cleaning up that fashion blog (or whatever it was) that was spruiking itself on /r/brisbane recently. There is only one thing you could change, and that's your collective attitude towards Grandmaster Watermelon (you may know him better as LawrenceWatermelon or VinDieselwithhair) are honestly ridiculous. There's a downvote system for a reason, and a lot of his more recent accounts (that you still banned) had plenty of upvoted posts where he's said something funny or insightful. There will be some occasions where he posts something inflammatory or ridiculous, but that's what downvotes are for. Robert_Houdin, kitzorz, Kreacher and myself have all had the pleasure of meeting him. The good news for you is that he has no intention of coming back anymore. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I just hope you have the sense not to send out a banning lynch mob the next time we get someone even remotely as funny as Papa Watermelon partaking in /r/brisbane.

* Before I go, fuck flair, as well as the tagging requirements... we don't get enough traffic to really be bothered by the amount of advertising we get, and it's never so bad unless autocorrect on a phone screws over the OP.

* Otherwise, keep up the good work, folks. Here's to another great year on /r/brisbane!"	t5_2qutz	True

1365988334.0	1ccz2o	Want to save 12% on your power bill?	stubbsie208	41	5	58	"Just so you know, the people you buy electricty off are not the people who produce it.  Ergon Energy supplies the energy, then energy retailers (energex, australenergy etc.) buy it in bulk and sell it to you at an inflated rate.

So they are just energy salesman.  And seeing as they can buy as much as they want, and it's not their infrastructure being used, they want as many customers as possible, even if they aren't making too much, as even 1c per megawatt more than what they paid is profit for them.  Which means you can haggle.

They are always trying to poach their competitors clients, which gives the power to you.

All you need to do to get up to 12% off your energy, if you are not on a locked in contract, is to call your electricity company and tell them that a competitor (google energy suppliers in your location) has offered you 8% off your electricity bill.  They will always match it.

Accept it, then wait a day.  Call back and tell them the competitor upped the bid to 12%, but if they can match it, you'd rather stick with them.  99% of the time, they will give you 12% off your electricity bill, no questions.

Picture this: 3 eighteen-year-olds at Newcastle Airport, not legally able to rent a car, too frugal to catch a taxi. Our natural option is to catch a bus. But wait a second! How do we get to our hotel room, two suburbs and 50 minutes south of where we're at?

I bring up Google Maps, and bam, I've got exactly the buses we need to catch and where we need to transfer (including where we need to walk). Glancing at the phone after boarding, I also notice we have a stop-by-stop indication of where we're currently at.

This feature, as a tourist down there, was absolutely life-saving to us. I felt, for once, that I knew precisely where to go, where to get off; that's something I've never felt on Translink services, even on my most well-known routes. I feel a massive need for this feature, both for tourists, and those of us who need to go on routes off the beaten track.

So I ask, why has Translink yet to implement this? I remember a petition going around about it by a prominent Australian rail forum, and while I believe it was promised by Campbell Newman during the election, I've yet to see any action taken by the new government. What's the situation here, and is there any ETA for it to roll out?

1366158984.0	1ci02w	Parent's car stolen from Arana Hills	parentsRobbed	39	6	15	"***update 25/4/13 - Police Communications contacted my parents today to advise them the car had been found burnt out someone near/at the Gold Coast. It seems like they had been driving the car around for the past week (came up on flags on road tolls). Seems there were a few burnt out cars recently. The car seat was one of the items discarded so they will get that back. Thanks guys for support/updates. Mum was upset car taken but glad it's been destroyed as she didn't want it back after someone else drove it the past week

Lesson learned - don't leave your keys/phone/wallet/etc in area where someone can do easy snatch and grab if they break in***

Hi All

My parent's house was broken into last night - Arana Hills suburb. 

Mum's car and mobile phone were stolen. She has just got back from her mother's funeral and after a sh|te day locked the house up but left her phone and keys on the bench in the kitchen area. Apparently the burglar jimmied a lock and then exited via front door (going by the kitchen on the way and grabbing what was in sight):(

The phone had a pin on it but she also contact her phone provided and know it hasn't been used, etc.

&lt;&lt;removed car details now car has been found&gt;&gt;&gt; There was a toddler car seat in it as well

Police mentioned there have been a few break in in the area recently and suspect the car will probably be used for future break-ins

I'd appreciate if you see the car, etc to report it to Police Communications or Ferny Grove police and hope the B@stard is caught

I have no idea how to do a self post but have created this as a throw-away account anyway.

I hope number plate is not considered personal details (I checked with mum before I made this post to ensure she okay with me doing this)"	t5_2qutz	True

I caught the train from Toowong to Bowen Hills today, and then back again (Scandinavian Festival). However, on the way back home, after tapping on at Bowen Hills the machine said ""Please touch again"", so I did.  It then said ""Already touched"".  I just went whatever, and got on the train.

The ticket inspector people did check us, and I assumed I was all fine. The officer (who was genuinely nice) looked at my history and told me that I'd done the right thing (according to the machines) but the machine had told me to re-touch when doing so was not correct. He then told me that no matter what the machine says, I should never re-touch. I should instead find one of those blue re-filling stations, and check my card status there, as apparently the ""please touch again"" message many times should not be followed.


Anyway, that all got sorted, no fine/warning or anything which was nice, but I was wondering. Has anyone else had this sort of issue with GoCards, either being caught from touching again when the machine said so, or having a transit officer tell you to ignore such a message from the machines?"	t5_2qutz	True

I will put up a voting thread once I get more photos of the cakes and stuff from phranticsnr (because I was late and hungover and didn't get to take many).

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

So, phranticsnr and I were discussing the need for another large /r/brisbane meetup where everyone is welcome (i.e. not restricted to bikes or beer or whatever). We decided on a general meetup, featuring CAKE! The idea is that everyone brings cake or some sort of baked goods if possible. Bake it, buy it, steal it, just bring it!

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;


**UPDATE:** We have decided to run a little bit of a friendly competition (only for those that wish to enter) ..... a **CAKE 'n' BAKE CONTEST!** 

**Contest rules:** All baked or dessert goods will be accepted as entries, but they must be home made by the submitter. You can have multiple entries if you bring multiple items. Items must be presented to either myself (s13_eisbaer) or phranticsnr so that we can take a photo of it for voting. After the event, we will upload all the photos, and everyone can vote for their favourite entry.

**PRIZE:** Winner will receive a year of [Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/help/gold)!


&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;


[Facebook Group Event](http://www.facebook.com/events/396962433666594/)

Okay, so here are some details. Please make more suggestions in the comments!!!

**Date:** Saturday, 14th April

**Time:** 11am until whenever

**Where:** New Farm Park - Trying to decide on exact meeting point. **Please discuss [here](http://redd.it/s3brk)!**

Oh no problem I thought, must have just been a mistake.

In the following 15 minutes, I spoke to the driver and the manager (Kenmore store FYI) who both said it was delivered and there was nothing they could do. No refund, no pizzas. They checked my history online and saw that I had ordered from them many times before. I asked them to drive out and check that they had the correct address. ""Nothing I can do"". Eventually the manager hung up on me.

Tried to call my bank to cancel the transaction, but then was told ""We're sorry, we're currently experiencing a high number of calls, and would appreciate you calling back later."" THEN THE ROBOT HANGS UP ON ME 

http://imgur.com/ZntKj

So now I'm hungry AND poor. OK it was only $30, but still. What to do Reddit?!


**EDIT: (12 Dec)** Thanks for all the replies! I posted a complaint via their corporate feedback page last night explaining the situation. No reply yet. My housemate called up the store today, spoke to the actual store manager (somebody other than the manager I spoke to last night) who said they received the complaint. So I have no idea if it really went to their corporate headquarters or just the Kenmore store. The manager also said I would have to call back tomorrow to get a refund (apparently he can't do it?), but didn't guarantee one. His words were ""The driver is definitely not lying"". Which means they think that either we are lying, or they are too stubborn to admit they made a mistake. If they only just drove back to the place they would realize they had the wrong place...

I'm just about to post a link to this thread on the Dominos facebook page, maybe somebody higher up will take notice of it. I'm not so angry about losing the money or pizza, it's just ridiculous that they would treat regular customers like this!

**EDIT: (13 Dec)** I posted on their Facebook page last night, and quickly received a reply with an email address. She quickly replied via email, and said she has sent out a voucher - though not sure for how much or for what store. Lesson learned: Complaints on public Facebook pages get dealt with much quicker than through 'corporate feedback'."	t5_2qutz	True

In case anyone gives a flaming galah, here's the breakdown (one a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being best):

Noggie:
* Taste- 7 (combining individual scores for both sweetness and tartness)
* Variety of toppings- 5
* Price- 5
* Service- 5
They also get bonus points for the very Scandinavian feel and the fake grass. 

Treat:
* Taste- 6
* Variety of toppings- 3 (they also had weird fish egg things that we later deduced were pearls)
* Price- 5
* Service- 5 ( except the guy at the counter laughed at us for not knowing how it works as it's self service. So fuck that guy)

Overall Noggie was the better one of the two, seemed to have fresher toppings and you didn't have to do it yourself. Which was awesome. You do have to give your name though and some people get weird about that. Not me. But some people.

**EDIT:** Just wanting to say there are a tonne of replies and I'm really thankful to everyone for the offers to meet up, hang out, etc! Being totally honest, I'm not great at the random socialising so it's a bit overwhelming but I definitely wanted to say thanks. =)

I try to keep myself pretty busy with work but when I have free time and really want to get out of the house I will definitely toss some of you message to meet up for drinks or coffee and use some of your suggestions for ways to get more social activity.

We are Brisbane comics and part of the sketch group [Skills in Time.](http://www.youtube.com/user/skillsintime/videos)

We currently look after the comedy show at the powerhouse which is called Livewired and runs every Sunday night, but we are starting a smaller more intimate venue on Wednesday nights at the Hideaway bar on Brunswick st (next to Step Inn). It is called [the Boom Boom Room](https://www.facebook.com/boomboomroomcomedy), and it is an alternative to the larger club comedy nights most people are used to. And it won't just feature stand-up comedy either, but comedy of all kinds. I promise it will be very different to the standard comedy night you might be used to. Also you should like that shit on facebook because it will give you a boner.

So if you like, please come along on August 8th at 8pm. Details for the show are on our [facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/boomboomroomcomedy). So check it out. Cheers"	t5_2qutz	True

Dressing up/costumes are not in the slightest bit necessary (usually about a third of the patrons put absolutely no effort in).

The Mana Bar event is going ahead. The event WILL be a closed event, private function only, closed door.

Before anyone gets the shits, I have to reiterate that the bar was going to be closed anyway. It was opened for me at my request. Secondly the door isn't THAT closed. You guys will still be able to come.

For what it's worth I asked people to PM me and I'd send them my bank details so they could put down for the bar tab. Only one redditor has done so, which is fine. There should be room for a bunch of you guys, but I've had about 40 people from elsewhere say they'll come AND put down cash.

The door will be closed, but NOT locked. Just say you're there for Matt's NYE party and you'll be let in.

I did want to quickly establish ""ground rules"", though. Those who come should know that the bar staff there are good friends of mine. Be nice to them. It's their party too. Come to think of it, that's about the only rule. If you come to the party from Reddit, come say hi. Enough people there should know me that if you ask someone will point."	t5_2qutz	True

This brings me no small amount of joy. So, last night, I headed out to PJ's in West End for a cheesesteak and was surprised by the number of passersby who stopped, peered into the shop, and still couldn't figure out what the hell a cheesesteak was.

Please, for the love of god, let me help you with that. 

At its most basic, a cheesesteak, or ""Philly cheesesteak,"" is a chopped steak sandwich with cheese and onion on a soft French roll. For authenticity purposes, the cheese should be either provolone (PJ's has it) or [Cheez Wiz](http://www.kraftbrands.com/cheezwhiz/) (PJ's doesn't have this - cheddar/American other lesser cheese options), which is not the same as ""Easy Cheese,"" the cheese you shoot out of a can. 

Having lived near Philadelphia for awhile (and in Chicago, where the cheesesteak's tastier cousin - the Italian beef - resides), I am going to require ongoing access to cheesesteaks, and therefore need to make you aware that this place exists, and you should be eating there.

The cheesesteak itself starts with thinly sliced raw ribeye, griddled on a flat top bbq and chopped up by the cook with his spatulas as he goes. Then, sauteed onion is tossed with the beef, with the cheese melted over top then tossed in as well. It turns the whole thing into a cheesey beefy sludge that tastes delicious. If you go, you can opt for mushroom, capsicum and/or jalapeno to be tossed in as it cooks, or can go for a ""cheesesteak hoagie,"" which simply adds lettuce and tomato cold to the top of the sandwich.

Pro tip: absolutely go for double cheese (provolone), and salt the sandwich well when it's ready.

Huge bonus here too is that the fries are good and the onion rings are OUTSTANDING. Probably the best rings I've had in years. None of that slimy inside stuff where the onion slips out of the casing. Instead, you bite clean through, it's crunchy, and they hit it with both salt and pepper so it definitely pops.

Oh, and beer. Did I mention beer?

Again, for the love of god, please frequent this place early and often so that access to my precious, precious cheesesteaks remains an ongoing option.

Thank you and good morning."	t5_2qutz	True

1340874598.0	vqep3	Wow, Origin Energy coming out with new power costing from July 11	Mercness	33	4	74	"**TLDR;** Rip out your wallets bitches, power's going up!




Got myself a nice letter in the mail from Origin today about tariff's going up for power from July 11.

Quick notes on this for people;

* 12.14% increase in Tariff 11 (Normal Residential)

* 55.64% increase in ""Service to your property"" (now 64.9c/day)

* 35.57% increase in Tariff 11 (Night Economy)

* 33.03% increase in Tariff 33 (Controlled Supply, hot water heaters etc)


So the bill for my house at least are going to go up from $518 for a quarter to $650, 20.21% in total

I've got a spreadsheet with it all done up and some calculators, happy to put it up if anyone wants to work out theirs.

Beyond that though, I am expecting a cry of ""go get solar, blame the carbon tax, down with labor, up with Can-Do, side ways with Barnaby etc, BUT at the end of the day, this kind of ""increase"" is absurd, if I was told my Internet/Rego/Food/etc was going up by 20% across the board, it would hurt the hip pocket, as it will countless others across QLD.


I've just been reading up on some figures for profit from origin too (http://www.originenergy.com.au/files/Origin_HY2012_Results_Presentation.pdf)
They claim profit of $489m December 11, up 37.8% from December 10, even if they only have an increase of 30% this year (lets call this a trend), that then provides them with ~670m profit, who knows how well they will end up doing out of charging me, a normal consumer an extra 20% on my power bill.

This guy also refused to move earlier in the journey for a man, but he did stand up and allowed the guy to sit in the window seat. Those two incidents alone were enough to piss me off somewhat as I was bought up to ""give way"" to the younger, older, pregnant and/or less able-bodied people.

What really pissed me off later was, the lady for whom this Asian guy refused to move for started having a conversation with a pregnant lady and although minding my own business, I could not help but hear this line:

""It's usually those kind that don't like to stand up for even elderly, pregnant or disabled people.""

What pissed me off isn't they because they were singling us Asians out, it was because we had become known for being inconsiderate and rude.

I could just be blowing steam here, but Asians of Brisbane, if you read this and **you are one** of those who don't ""give way"" to the less able bodied - Fuck you and stand the fuck up.

To those who do - **thank-you** for being great representatives of our respective cultures and for showing that we are not inconsiderate and/or rude."	t5_2qutz	True

Like many Australian redditors, I'm moderately left-of-centre, and due to policies such as the NBN and Gonski among others, I'm really hoping for a Labor win (in 2PP terms) in the upcoming federal election - though I'm not a Labor member, and more of a Green/Democrat in my political views.

It's shaping up to be a [very tight election](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger), and the seats won or lost in QLD will probably decide it. One of the most marginal seats in QLD is [Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Brisbane), encompassing the CBD and immediate surrounding suburbs, and held by the Liberals by *1.1%* in the 2010 election.

My point is this: If you really give a shit about issues like the NBN, education, [cross-river rail for Brisbane](http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/kevin-rudd8217s-plan-to-win-over-queensland-voters-includes-restarting-brisbane8217s-stalled-cross-river-rail-project/story-fnihsrf2-1226671604987), and just not having pointless austerity - even if Labor are just a less shit choice than the Coalition - you might actually be able to have an impact this time around. *Last election the informal vote was higher than the 2PP vote difference in Brisbane.*

So my advice is to get out there and [volunteer for the ALP](http://www.queenslandlabor.org/volunteer-sign-up/) in the Division of Brisbane, or [The Greens](http://qld.greens.org.au/) or [Democrats](http://www.australiandemocrats.org.au/qld_division) anywhere. Hand out flyers, talk to people, get them to enrol to vote, share your ideas, whatever. If you feel you might look like a tool doing it, ask yourself: *is that more important than the political and social issues that affect us?*

**Edit**: While this is a blatantly partisan post, I feel I should also take the opportunity to encourage everyone to research and/or get involved in whichever party they most identify with. Better than apathy.

Also: [*make sure you're enrolled to vote!!!*](http://www.aec.gov.au/)

**Edit^2**: Wow, a real shitstorm! I appreciate this is annoying to some people, but to quote ScreamingGoat : ""go on, down vote me to oblivion. If one person reads this, I've achieved something."" Ironically summed it up quite well.

**Edit^3**: Included The Greens and Democrats in my missive since this is obviously bigger than just the next election."	t5_2qutz	True

The study involves learning strange new names for pictures of unfamiliar objects while you have your brain scanned (using functional MRI). It’s not too much of a time commitment, you just need to come in for:

1 pre-test session at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (RBWH), Herston (takes about 1.5 hours)

1 brain scan session at the Wesley Hospital, Auchenflower (takes about 2 hrs)

1 quick follow-up session at the RBWH, Herston (takes about 30 mins).

Both these locations are easily accessible by public transport.

For your troubles, we'll pay you $10 per hour, plus $10 or a taxi voucher to cover travel on the day of your scan, and $2 for every word you recall correctly!

To participate, you must be: 18 to 35 years of age - right handed - non smoker - English is your first language - no history of brain injury, neurological conditions, mental illness or speech-language disorder - not taking any meds affecting your brain (eg. antidepressants)

For more info, go to the following link: http://www.uqccr.uq.edu.au/language-neuroscience-lab/participate.aspx and download the information sheet and questionnaire forms. Then shoot me an email at a.rawlings@uq.edu.au and we’ll take it from there.

The ultimate goal of this study is to help develop new treatments for people who lose their speech after having a stroke. So it's research for a good cause. But I can't do it without you! Thanks so much for your help :-)"	t5_2qutz	True

  Little bit of background before I get to my point....

  I suppose I'm going through a few changes at the moment. Lot's of big questions about life, wondering if feeling unsure about yourself is quite common around this age. It's like being 15 again and confused about what I should do with my life but feeling as though it will be great anyway. Only instead this time, I feel stuck between following my dreams, or just buy a house and start a family. I've been working really hard lately to get my shit together, but the road to success just keeps knocking me down. Perhaps I expect too much from myself. All I know is it's starting to take a toll on my overall happiness. 

I no longer share any of the same interests as those who I grew up with. So I've grown away from the friends I went to highschool with. They've all settled in and have decided to stop learning new things, stop travelling, and just generally settle down. It's good that they're happy but it's not a good environment for someone like me to be in. 

I'm a very creative person, and would love to at the very least meet up with others who share the same passion for music and art. Being a hermit for the past 2 years has had me miss out on a lot of Brisbane culture. I want to go out to the theatre again, I want to go watch bands play. 

I have a lot of time on my hands as I work for myself teaching guitar and music theory. It doesn't pay well but I earn plenty for what I need. Growing up I wanted to be a professional musician, you know, getting a regular gig playing jazz at a small bar somewhere, perhaps even maybe doing some session work. I didn't think it was too much to ask but finding people in Brisbane who would be dedicated to such an unreliable line of work has proven to be quite difficult. 

So instead, I've taken up programming. I've been developing mobile apps for just over a year now and have seen some mild success with them. I love doing it because it challenges me everyday, and is insanely rewarding. It's awesome to see stats and know that people all over the world are buying your product that you have worked so hard on. Although, there's only so far one person can go.

This is where I'm at now..
Asking redditors of Brisbane this question. 
Are there any people around feeling as lost as I am, with some unique talents, and spare time, who would like to, go to gigs, dinners, pubs, and work on projects together. I would love to see a whole bunch of us sitting around having a few drinks and brainstorming ideas. Whether it be a new game, mobile app, web service, tv show or charity. 

I know it's a long shot. So at the moment I will take anything that will get me out of the house, as my line of work at the moment is really lacking any methods to generating a social life. 

It's long I know, and late. So I may have rambled on a bit. 
Thanks for reading.

I am looking for advice on ways to spend a fantastic day in Brisbane. My match for the Arbitrary Day gift exchange is located in your fair city, and I want to send him on a fairly epic adventure.

I have trawled a bit through your subreddit and good'ole google, and I have some ideas of how to go about this, but I am looking for some refined information. The Wheel of Brisbane (Is a ride worth it?), Mt. Coot-tha lookout (Is it easy enough to reach?), Mass transit (How expensive is the Citycat, exactly?). And a certain Vietnamese Pork Salad Roll place outside the Darra Train Station (What is the ratio between train journey annoyance and pork bun deliciousness?). I also want to find out some fun things to do that aren't posted on tourist sites, like, perhaps, the location of a vintage photo booth, or a bar that has skee ball.

I am also looking for someone who knows Brisbane very well, and can help me with some spoiler advice. So if that person is you, send me a PM. 

Thanks for any advice and insight you can give. I have never been to Australia (I've been close; Kiwi land), but planning out this journey is making me feel like I am putting some shrimp on the barbie and cracking a fosters (Ok, I lied. I had to add in some more terrible Australian stereotypical slang, just one more time). "	t5_2qutz	True

My speakers and such will be hooked up to an ipod dock so if you have some of your own music that you want to play just bring your ipod along. I can expect everyone to be decent human beings and try not to make too much of a mess.

If everyone is still keen to party later into the night we will probably head out to the valley/fat louis's (pretty sure that is the offical reddit meet up bar now).


When: Forever alone's day (tuesday) 7- whenever

Where: 65 boundary street, south brisbane, upstairs (it's like a student house)


There will be free parking about two doors down at coles or if that is full there is paid parking down the street at a number of places. Message me if you have any other questions or any song requests :D

EDIT: Derped the title

DOUBLE EDIT: IF ANYONE HAS SOME ESKY'S TO BRING ALONG, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME, probably not going to have enough room for everyone drinks in the fridge.

So I saw the [Queensland Buses](http://www.qldbuses.info/index.php?page=seqtransportmap) Google Earth file that had all the Translink routes, but since I didn't want to have to load up Google Earth just to view this and I figured nobody else really wants to either, I wrote [a little app](http://maps.mytrans.it) that takes that data and presents it in an interface that lets you search and show individual routes on Google Maps. It's kind of ugly at the moment and there's probably bugs, but it works fairly well IMO.

Enjoy!

PS. I also wrote [myTransit](http://mytrans.it) which is currently an iPhone-specific web app that's a better interface to Translink's journey planner with a normal browser version in the works.
PPS. I hope I submitted this properly this time.
