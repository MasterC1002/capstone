I'm just a lowly pop science enthusiast with very little formal education in the physics arena, but I'm incredibly interested in learning and am begging for your knowledgable help.  

This, http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg

My understanding is that this diagram represents the creation of light?  Or at least the creation of a photon after annihilation.  Can anyone elaborate on if this?

But my real questions come after.  

-What is the cause of the photon's decay?
-Once the photon has decayed into two quarks, What happens to the quarks, do they just bounce around?
-The biggest mystery to me, where does the gluon come from?  Why is it only spawned from one of the quarks as opposed to one gluon from each quark.  What does the quark have that the anti-quark does not?  
-Finally, What generally happens to the gluon after it spawns from the quark?

Any answers are very much appreciated.  My apologies for lack of understanding what are probably grade school concepts for most of you.

What would happen if, you take an area the size of a room. Maybe 6x10, and you cut off everything from the outside world. You take out all the bacteria, organisms, particles, electrons, etc down to neutrinos. You make it so nothing at all is inside, no light, nothing. No frequencies, not the smallest known quantum instances could penetrate this room. What would happen inside of it? Would the inside still exist? Does it take an observer? Would the temperature drop? also in theory, would this experiment even be possible?	t5_2r454	True

It is *not* perfect by any means, but posting it here for polshing up - or even better analogies. I like analogies.

In understanding ""Collapsing the wave function"" with regards to particles &amp; waves - it is like a single, fast rotating blade on a rotor aircraft. When it is rotating you see a complete blured circle - the blade seeming like it is smeared across the entire ring (wave). But if you could stop the blade instantaneously to measure the blade's position, you would find the blade at one particular position. This is like collapsing the wave function to measure a particles position.

The analogy then follows on with regards to “Heisenberg uncertainty principle” that states that we cannot know simultaneously a particle’s position and momentum. When the blade is spinning fast, we can work out its speed or momentum, but not its position. But when we stop the blade we can measure its position, but now not its speed. 


What other analogies that you have that help explain particle physics?

In the standard modell the sum of the two diagrams is independet of xi by virtue of the dirac equation: slashed(p)nu=m_nu*nu. In the presence of majorana mass terms, this seems to hold no longer: the dirac equation is still valid, so that in the W-diagram the full masses of the neutrinos occur, while in the Phi-diagram only the Yukawa matrices proportional to the dirac mass occur, so that the sum of the two diagrams is no longer gauge invariant.

What is the reason or underlying principle that determines the orbits of electrons?  I know each orbital can have only limited electrons and that electrons have spin.  Mostly my understanding relates to chemistry and the electron orbitals and their role in reactions.  
Electrons are most stable in lower orbitals or in complete orbitals, but I don't understand the quantum mechanical reasoning on why.  Orbitals are very organized and discrete distances from the nucleus.  I understand part of this must be a result of the negative and positive relationship of the nucleus and the electrons as well as negative-negative repulsion between electrons.

I'm hoping someone can clear this up. I'm confused about whether the color force between two quarks increases linearly with distance or stays constant after a certain distance has been reached. I understand that for small distances there is asymptotic freedom and the force increases until a certain point, but I keep finding conflicting information about what happens after asymptotic freedom is no longer dominant.

So, essentially I'm interested in finding out the behavior of the color force between two regions: the area between the region where asymptotic freedom is dominant (i.e. small separation) and the region where hadronization occurs. Does the force increase linearly with distance in this region or does it remain constant? I'd be grateful if someone could clear this up for me. Thanks in advance."	t5_2r454	True

Now, given my understanding of both camera and the LHC. I highly doubt a camera, no matter how advanced, could ""photograph"" the particle collisions. I was under the impression that there was at least one particle detector that acted like a camera in the fact that it had an ""image sensor"" that could detect where a particle from the collision hit.

I've neer posted here before but hopefully someone can help.
I am using RooFit to do a simultaneous fit to 3 histograms.
The pdf I am using is a Gaussian+1st order polynomial
There is an example macro at $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit/rf501_simultaneouspdf.C

The three histograms share the same and CONSTANT mean and width.
Each gaussian also shares the same and FLOATING parameter multiplying the gaussian.
The 1st order polynomials constant and linear terms are different

To achieve this in RooFit I am doing

  RooGenericPdf*   model_1   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_1"",  ""model_1"",  ""unknownbf*exp(-0.5*(x-0)*(x-0)/(0.0297*0.0297))+a_1+b_1*x"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_1, *b_1 )) ;
  RooGenericPdf*   model_2   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_2"",  ""model_2"",  ""unknownbf*exp(-0.5*(x-0)*(x-0)/(0.0297*0.0297))+a_2+b_2*x"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_2, *b_2 )) ;
  RooGenericPdf*   model_3   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_3"",  ""model_3"",  ""unknownbf*exp(-0.5*(x-0)*(x-0)/(0.0297*0.0297))+a_3+b_3*x"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_3, *b_3 )) ;

I then make a category link it to RooDataHist objects, combine the RooDataHist object into one combined data sets (the categories seperate the 3 data set) and make a RooSimultaneous object.

  RooCategory tagCat(""tagCat"", ""tagCat"") ;
  
  map&lt;string, RooDataHist*&gt; modemap;
tagCat.defineType(""Mode1"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode1 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_1"",  ""HMode_1"",  *x, htot_1)  ;
modemap[""Mode1""]  = hmode1  ;
  tagCat.defineType(""Mode2"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode2 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_2"",  ""HMode_2"",  *x, htot_2)  ;
modemap[""Mode2""]  = hmode2  ;
  tagCat.defineType(""Mode3"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode3 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_3"",  ""HMode_3"",  *x, htot_3)  ;
modemap[""Mode3""]  = hmode3  ;
  
  RooDataHist* combData = new RooDataHist(""combData"",""combined data"",*x,Index(tagCat),Import(""Mode_1"",*hmode1),Import(modemap)) ;


RooSimultaneous* simPdf = new RooSimultaneous(""simPdf"",""simultaneous pdf"",tagCat) ;

  // Associate model with the mode 1 and mode 2
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_1, ""Mode1"")  ;
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_2, ""Mode2"")  ;
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_3, ""Mode3"")  ;

I then

RooFitResult* r_gauss = simPdf-&gt;fitTo(*combData,  Constrain(*unknownbf), Save()) ;

And plot

TCanvas* cgauss1 = new TCanvas(""Gauss 1"",""My 3 Mode Example"",800,400) ;
    cgauss1-&gt;Divide(3) ;

RooPlot* frame1  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100),Title(""Mode 1""))  ;combData-&gt;plotOn(frame1, Cut(""tagCat==tagCat::Mode1""))  ;simPdf-&gt;plotOn(frame1, Slice(tagCat,""Mode1""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(1) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame1-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame1-&gt;Draw() ;
    RooPlot* frame2  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100),Title(""Mode 2""))  ;combData-&gt;plotOn(frame2, Cut(""tagCat==tagCat::Mode2""))  ;simPdf-&gt;plotOn(frame2, Slice(tagCat,""Mode2""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(2) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame2-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame2-&gt;Draw() ;
    RooPlot* frame3  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100),Title(""Mode 3""))  ;combData-&gt;plotOn(frame3, Cut(""tagCat==tagCat::Mode3""))  ;simPdf-&gt;plotOn(frame3, Slice(tagCat,""Mode3""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(3) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame3-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame3-&gt;Draw() ;
    cgauss1-&gt;Print(filename+""_gauss_1.jpg"") ; 

Nothing crashes and it seems fine but the giveaway that something is not being plotted correctly is that the size of the gaussians of the 3 fits are not the same. A big problem, this is the whole point of the simultaneous fit so I am at a loss. Maybe it is how I plot the RooSimultaneous object that is wrong or maybe it doesn't like the RooGeneric I've given it?? No idea, any insight is greatly appreciated. If someone wants the original code I can send it just ask me

I've got a text book here and there are two Feynman diagrams, apparently showing the process of electron capture and electron–proton collision. The diagrams show the proton and electron on one side and neutron and anti-neutrino on the other side (if anyone knows the terms to help me describe that better, that would be a nice tip too), but in the electron capture event, the proton emits (?) a W+ boson, and in the e-p collision, the electron emits a W- boson.

What is the difference between these two events? How do we know and why is it that they should have a different exchange particle, when the process seems otherwise identical?

I'm currently a junior physics major at a university in the USA.  I'm here to see what advice you may have to give me regarding what I do this summer and what I do in the future.  First let me explain.  

I don't know any scientists really and we've never had one in the family.  In fact, I'm the first person in my family to study hard science in college.  This past semester I started doing research in high energy particle with a professor at my university, and I realized that a career in industry might not be what I want, but rather I might prefer going into academia, getting the Ph.D., the whole shebang.  I really fell in love with high energy particle and I'm trying to plan out the next few years right.  

I've forgone internships for the past two summers (after freshman year I worked manual labor and after sophomore year I studied abroad in China), but I have to do something physics-y this summer.  My question to you is: what do you think is my best move?  

The options:  
1) (the one I've pretty much decided on) Stay in the city my university is in, make a pittance of money, and continue my research work either on a scholarship or with funds from the department.  
2) Take an REU somewhere near where I live and make a little more money, but abandon my exact research and my current advisor.  
3) Do something else.  

Other factors:  
•Money is not an issue for me.  I don't have a lot of it at all but my schooling is paid for mostly by scholarships, then my parents, then by my own funds, and then by loans I don't plan to worry about until I can.    
•My research advisor and I get along extremely well.  In fact, I don't know if I would have made the same decisions career-wise if I had worked with someone else.  We click very well and I love my project and I love learning from my advisor.  
•My grades are good.  I have above a 3.85 GPA right now.  
•My housemate might stay in the city as well over the summer, in which case I'd really like to live with him then (we get along really well too).  

I think that's everything.  Any and all advice (including grad school stuff or cool stories) is greatly appreciated.  Mainly I'd like to know how actual physicists do things and how you guys would have decided if you were me.  I'll try to come back through the day and give more details if you want to know them.  You guys rock.

So the idea is to fit the hProject histogram over the interval (-15199, -201) but have this exponential function be defined on the interval (-35000, 600).  hNeutron is a histogram that is already filled and loaded before running the macro.  The intervals are reversed since the predefined function ""expo"" is an exponential decay and I want an exponential growth fit.  The error I'm getting is:

TF1 *fit = new TF1(""fit"",""expo"",0,-5000);

I have invested a lifetime living and learning in the macro world, which seems to have prejudiced my mind towards such thinking.   

I have a toddler - Any thoughts on what I might do to help him think in both worlds?

He already has an incredible sense of the larger universe (orbits, planets, galaxies, stars, moons, etc.) thanks to Google earth and especially Celestia, but I have not been able to find similar tools to give him a sense of the world of the small.  Ideas?

Edits / follow up:
  1 - Good recommendations from all - thanks
  2 - I didn't mean to really imply that QM is ""easy"".  What I meant was that in classical mechanics, it's intuitive because you have the advantage of everyday experience to teach it to you on an intuitive level.  In QM, you don't, so maybe there are computer programs, web sites, games, or whatever, that introduce some of the ideas or ways of thinking while the small mind is building a picture of the world.  It's easy to see the splash in a puddle of water - it's much more difficult to calculate that splash, or even just imagine it if you have never seen a splash in water!

Hello-Universe	7	5	9	"I remember reading an article that said the Higgs Boson may be travelling so fast that it travelled back in time and prevented the scientists from ever discovering it.
That got me thinking. Is it possible that there's particles travelling faster than the speed of light all around us, but we will never be able to observe them because they are traveling through time and never exist in the present?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't light travel so fast that time is still for it? Every place it has ever travelled to has all been in the same instant. The beginning of the universe to the present is all the same moment in time for a light particle, correct?
So if something is travelling faster than light, it would be travelling back in time. Therefore we will never be able to observe it, because it exists in alternative universe.
Could this also be how the big bang started? Since, from what I gather, it began from essentially nothing. Out of nowhere. Could it be that a travelling particle travelled so fast that it travelled to a time where no universe exists, and therefore sparked one into existence upon it's arrival?"	t5_2r454	True

There are probably many answers to this because it is inherently a subjective question, but how is entropy characterized in quantum physics? I mean really semantically/theoretically. For example in biology it is dispersal of energy, in chemistry it is dispersal of heat (so the same thing), in information theory it is characterized as uncertainty. I've also heard it characterized as disorder. Anarchists would say chaos.

So what is the practicable characterization of entropy to physicists? Would this differ between an experimentalist versus a theorist? And would it differ across quantum versus classical?

I say that we do not have sufficient resolution in our detection equipment to tell one electron from another and all we are noticing is that they can move inter-dimensionally. I think we shot one at a target and on the way there it may have gone somewhere else and another one very near it (in some dimension or universe for that matter) had taken its place but was not exactly on the same trajectory because at a subatomic level when dealing with something that can move inter-dimensionally you still have the possibility that another electron from somewhere else was pulled into your observation area only because something flew past it with similar mass and gravity pulled on it for that split second which sent it along a very near trajectory to the electron you shot (jumping dimensions on the way). If we had high speed film on the order of 33 million frames per second and a lens that could actually see a single electron very precisely (that time will come) we could somehow mark that electron and then shoot it at a target and track its path the make sure it did not ""leave"" and hit the exact same place we aimed it, then collect it and look for the proper identification to end the discussion as to electrons or other particles deciding to ""do"" anything because they are being watched. What if electrons are not like marbles but instead they are more like drops of oil in water (space-time)...they are squishy and can change shape and be confused for waves and they can move inter-dimensionally. So until we can mark one and watch it from release to target and then capture and confirm that is the same electron..that experiment was inconclusive.

The first part is to look at the interaction:

Now here is the part I am confused about. We are asked what interaction we would think would cause the decay of this particle. I assume they mean, ""What interaction would cause K^* -&gt; K^+ \pi^0"". It seems to me that it would be a strong interaction (because of the resulting pion) but I am not sure how to show this!

Yesterday while doing some fiddling about I stumbled upon an interesting property that I'm sure is well-known and very intuitive to someone who has a better knowledge of group theory than I do, and the property is interesting and useful enough for me to seek a more fundamental explanation of it. It goes like this:  
The space spanned by the Pauli Matrices is closed under SU(2) transformations. That is, for any matrix representation of an SU(2) transformation U and any linear combination of Pauli Matrices M, the transformed M, given by UMU^-1 , will also be a linear combination of Pauli Matrices. I'm wondering why exactly this is from a group theory perspective.  
I stumbled upon this while proving the SU(2) invariance of the nucleon-pion Lagrangian in search of the conserved current, and I proved it brute force by using a general U matrix and a general Pauli matrix and the properties of the SU(2) symmetry.  I suspect it has to do with one of two things:  
1) Maybe it's connected to the Pauli Matrices being the generators of the SU(2) group  
2) Maybe it's because the SU(2) transformation works sort of like a rotation of coordinates would, except that the basis vectors aren't the x, y, and z axes, they're the Pauli Matrices.  
I hope my question isn't too ignorant and I apologize for any errors or misunderstanding on my part. I'm a student, and I have not taken a formal group theory class (though the more particle physics I learn the more I realize how helpful that could be!). If any more clarification is needed I hope to be able to provide it in the comments.  
Thanks for your help. Cheers!"	t5_2r454	True

I assume some sort of integration by parts is at work, but the covariant derivative is complicating things and the indices are a bit screwy. More specifically, I assume the step goes along the lines x*df(x0)/dx integrates to x^2*df(x0)/dx - int(x^2*d2f(x0)/dx2), but then I've picked up a minus sign and an extra d/dx term.
