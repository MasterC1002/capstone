1357516096.0	163535	Advice To Fans Attending Games	SveNss0N	133	17	69	"Fellow Bruins fans,

The news that broke this morning was fantastic. I myself, not just as a fan but also as a season ticket holder am ecstatic at the prospect of returning to the Garden for games in the next 2-3 weeks. I am excited to hopefully see Dougie Hamilton in action. I am happy to be able to hear the goal horn go off again - plain and simple, it's been too long.

However, as happy as we all are, let's not forget the impact that the lockout has had on the businesses around the TD Garden including the numerous restaurants and shops and let's not forget that Jacobs was a big part of that issue. I personally know a bunch of people who work there including some who are part of the bullgang and saw their hours slashed near completely. All of that in the name of greed - it was billionaires fighting millionaires and we, the fans, were taken for granted.

This is why I'd like to invite all of you who plan on attending games to do the following:


**DO NOT**: Eat, drink or buy anything at the TD Garden or the pro shop. Not only is it a ripoff, but it's also sending the wrong message to the owners. Plus the food isn't that good, the beer isn't all that great and it's all grossly overpriced. Need a jersey? Buy one online from these Chinese sweatshops like I do. Make sure that the only thing you spend money on is the bare minimum: essentially it should be your ticket. That's it.

INSTEAD

**DO**: Drink and eat around the TD Garden prior to and/or after games and don't forget to leave generous tips to the people who have been longing the return of hockey in town.

But let's be real, guys. We've got ourselves one hell of a team here. We've got sooo many guys under 30. We will continue to contend and we will continue to believe. We have the most heart out of any team I've ever seen, personally. 

We're no Pittsburgh Penguins, built to win one year and fucked for the next. We're going to be a perennial contender for years to come. 

Bergeron, Krejci, Seguin, Lucic, Marchy, Horton (UFA now though), Campbell (LOVE YOU SOUPY), Paille, Boychuk, Bartkowski, Krug, Hamilton, McQuaid, Rask, Khudobin. All of those guys are under 30, and a lot of them are under 26. 

That's an amazing young core of forwards and an amazing young core of Defense paired with Rask (and let's not forget about Svedberg and Subban!). 

Basically, in the end, we're all sad and angry and bitter and all that right now. It was very hard for me to wake up this morning and go to work. We put our hearts into the sport and we fell just short. But it's OK, my fellow Bruins fans. Let us not wallow in our past, but rejoice in our future.

**TLDR;** We may have lost, but we have a bright future.

Unrelated sidenote: Love you guys. I live in New York, I know only one other Boston fan. Let's be real, NY fans can be huge assholes.

So I grew up in the Boston area, and, like most people here, I have friends that were right by the explosions and friends that live in Watertown. I love the unity the city showed and the appreciation they showed to all the first responders. And that's why I love the ""Boston Strong"" slogan, it's a great way to express that sentiment for how the whole city united.

However, I fucking hate when ""Boston Strong"" is used to talk about a Bruins comeback or a Red Sox game, etc. I think it completely waters down the phrase and disrespects the true meaning behind it. It's about something so much more than a meaningless sporting event. (And I realize we all live and die by each Bruins game, but in the grand scheme of life, they're meaningless)

And I realize that that first Bruins game after the bombings was an awesome event that helped heal the city, and I didn't mind using the phrase then. But now is used for every fucking game they win.

People get upset by the ""Toronto Stronger"" and ""Chicago Stronger"" shit, and I don't blame them one bit, it's crazy disrespectful. But what do people expect when a phrase gets watered down so much. When it's used to describe your hockey team, of course some jackass fan from the other team will use it towards their team, because they probably don't even realizethe impact of that phrase anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to justify that shit, it's terrible and disrespectful. I'm just not surprised by it.

I just wish people would understand that by using that phrase to describe menial crap, it takes away from what that phrase should mean to everyone.

End rant

Oh hey, don't forget to check [Jack Edwards twitter](https://twitter.com/RealJackEdwards) for his words of wisdom throughout the game.

This morning with Rich talking about how Seguin refused to live with a vet player and how that could have contributed to his problems.  He lived with Thornton last year.  The reports about him showing up in the same clothes for 3 days in a row in Toronto for the playoffs is wrong, he wore the same suit the whole time he was up there because he only brought one.  

I don't mind people saying they think it's a good trade but how they have been ripping Seguin is ridiculous.   Yea he didn't perform the way we needed him to in the playoffs but I don't think he was as bad as the media is portraying it.  

Am I alone here?

Bruins become only team with six 20-goal scorers: Chris Kelly scored his 20th goal of the season, setting a career high in goals and also making the Bruins the only team in the NHL to have six players with 20 goals or more apiece. Marchand (27), Seguin (27) Lucic (24), Krejci (23) and Bergeron (21) are the other Bruins who have lit the lamp 20 times or more this season.

I expect many are sad to see Seguin go, but trust me, you guys get a gem in Loui Eriksson. He isn't well known around the league, which is just part of playing in a non-traditional hockey market. Loui is a blue-collar guy who puts his head down, keeps his mouth shut, and does his job. Oh and he also has a ton of skill. He's a great 2-way player that should fit nicely with Bergeron. 

I've always rooted for the B's, and now I have even more reason to do so. We'll take care of Seguin, as I'm sure you guys will take care of Loui.

Tuukka Rask (who is Finnish) has been wonderful this year and I'm hoping he can carry us all the way. I'm a lifelong Boston fan (grew up in Lexington) and have always loved how smart and knowledgeable the Boston fanbase can be when it's at its best.

How cool would it be for fans to hold up signs reading

If you are from here and you know Steve burton then you know he's legit. Since then I've been keeping my ear a little closer to the ground than usual, and it seems to have begun to quake. First there's Burton's tweet. Then reports of 17 joining a group of local pros for skates for the first time, rumors of players trickling into hometown terminals across the continent, players and owners meeting WITHOUT LAWYERS, consecutive days of negotiations, and now nick kryspos is reporting that coaches have been calling their players to tell them to prepare for an immediate return. We may be 10-14 days away from sweet, beautiful, sexy hockey.

Edit: these reports appear to be substantiated. According to Bettman, a resolution should be completed and made official on Friday. Furthermore, Matthew barnaby of espn has apparently been told by an unnamed owner that the first puck is projected to drop on December 26th. Let's acknowledge WBZ's Steve Burton for getting the inside track on the Canadian hockey media mafia. He may not have had the date right but he sure as hell knew which way the winds were blowing. I'd love to know who his source is because apparently it's a reliable one who also seems to be privy to some pretty sensitive info in the hockey world."	t5_2rmt9	True

Game 7 was so close and a great example of how hockey should be played (no penalties!). You guys studied our tactics and it showed in the last 2 games. Boy was it tough getting past your D! You gave us no time on the puck. It was also great to see two old hands play so well (Roli and Thomas). Marty St.Louis is an example to us all, what a guy. What I saw last night makes me proud to be a Lightning fan. Good luck in the Final. As for who should I support in the final? Maybe I should get my Ray Bourque shirt out the drawer? :)

You may or may not have noticed yet but as of now we have disabled the down-vote feature here. I have noticed a lot of downvotes happening lately during our game threads and discussions that are obviously not from fellow Bruins fans here. We all know how it's like to be a marked Bruins fan over in [r/hockey](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey) and how we are subject to down-vote bandwagons simply because we sport the spoked B. When I created this subreddit I wanted it to be a place where Bruins fans, as well as other fans from different teams could come and post/discuss recent happenings without having to deal with outside negative influence. **This change can be easily reversed.**

Some of you may ask ""how will we get rid of troll posts, etc.?"", the answer is simple. You can use the report button underneath the comment, as well as an increased moderating presence for comments. As most of the older subscribers here know, we have rarely ever had to police anything but unfortunately there seems to be a need for a slight increase in this.

*Please* give us your feedback on this, whether or not you like it the changes. Give us your insight on everything, and tips that you believe may make this a better community (who am I kidding, we're awesome). Help us help you, that's what we are here for. We can't fix issues we don't know about. 

**I have also updated our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonBruins/help/faqs/BostonBruins) as well. This should help everyone understand what we are looking for in regards to submissions and comments.**

UP TO DATE!
-Their sidebar is filled with good UPDATED content.

Game threads
-they have updated scores, line ups, stats, fuckin stories! why dont we have shit like that. That'd be cool.

Links
-how many times have i been on here and seen the comment ""anyone have a link?"" they have them all set up. all you do is click ""Game Streams""


Seems these mods dont really give a shit. Maybe they dont have time.. thats fine. Can we elecet new mods?
Im not saying we should copy other teams, but some fuckin updates and content would be nice. 
lol... like look at our sidebar.


Im not saying we need these things. I can look up all this shit if i want. But im on here all the time now (especially during playoffs) mostly to socialize and read what everyones posting. But theres room for improvement. 

thoughts?

does anyone really care? aha

#### Summary

**Big Story:** 
The Bruins begin their defense of the 2011 Stanley Cup championship, while the Capitals begin their quest to make everyone forget about a disappointing regular season.

**The Hotness:**
 Alex Ovechkin had the lowest point total and second-worst goal total of his career, but he did score 10 times in the final 13 games of the regular season. … Brian Rolston had three goals and 15 points in 21 games for the Bruins after arriving in a trade from the Islanders. Patrice Bergeron had six points in his final four games of the regular season.

**Injury Report:**
Holtby is expected to start Game 1 for the Capitals because Tomas Vokoun (groin) and Neuvirth (lower body) are not expected to be available. Neuvirth might be able to go later in this round; Vokoun's return is less certain. … The Bruins announced Wednesday that right wing Nathan Horton will not be available this postseason because of a concussion. Defenseman Adam McQuaid and backup goaltender Tuukka Rask are also both likely out for Game 1, though defenseman Johnny Boychuk is expected to play despite a knee injury.

*****  
  
#### Stat Pack
Stat Pack: Boston's ""second line"" became the team's top line over the course of the season. Bergeron, Brad Marchand and Tyler Seguin were third most-productive trio in the League at even strength this season, according to the Line Production tool at dobberhockey.com. They combined for 87 points while on the ice together, which trailed only Pittsburgh's trio of Evgeni Malkin, James Neal and Chris Kunitz (96 points) and Detroit's trio of Henrik Zetterberg, Valtteri Filppula and Jiri Hudler (103 points).

Surprisingly, Ovechkin is not part of Washington's most productive trio -- Jason Chimera, Mathieu Perreault and Alexander Semin were on the ice together for 27 points at even strength.

anyway, when the PB's were doing their warm ups, my kid was standing at the glass watching them, Chris Clark (17) skated by and my son waved to him, he waved back, which shocked me, most of the players don't even bother to look at you. Shortly after that exchange, Chris went out of his way to get him a puck by throwing it lightly over the glass, the first attempt missed and he did it again...

After that he gave my kid a thumbs up to which my son gleefully did back to him. It's just a black puck, nothing special but my kid held onto it all night like it was made of gold.

It is with great pride and excitement I write to you, having been officially named the eighth team President in Boston Bruins history earlier today. I can honestly say it has been an incredible experience these last three seasons working in the Bruins front office; rewarding, eye-opening, difficult at times, but one that I have truly enjoyed each and every day. We have made great strides as an organization in recent years both on and off the ice. But having said that, we understand much more progress can be made, and much more progress needs to be made if we are able to meet our ultimate objectives. As President, I embrace these challenges that lie ahead and eagerly look forward to taking this organization to new heights.

I know first-hand the passion Bruins fans possess, especially the passion you, our season ticket holders, possess. I experienced it every time I stepped on to the Garden ice during my playing days and I've experienced it at every game I've attended since. I know what it's like for a player to skate in front of a packed house and how much that helps you perform better when you are out there. To see the fan base grow over the last few years and see us regain that true home ice advantage again has been exciting for me. The atmosphere during our home games has been electric at times and that is a credit to you, our season ticket holders, for making our building one of the loudest in the entire league.

I also have a good understanding of your expectations of the players that play here and the expectations of the team in general. We want players that are hard working, accountable, and understand what it means to be a Bruin. You should be rest assured that the entire organization from ownership through management is committed to building a championship team around those characteristics and building a team that you are proud to support. We have done some positive things on the ice during the last three seasons and have some exciting things to look forward to in the coming months, like next week's draft and opening the regular season in Prague.

However, I think we all agree there's some unfinished business.

As a player, I always wanted to keep reaching for the next rung of the ladder, keep improving every year individually and collectively as a team. I ultimately fell short of my goal of winning the Stanley Cup as a player and that is still difficult to accept, even today. But I am thrilled where I am now, with the opportunity to help bring the Cup back to Boston as the team's President. Know that the commitment is there from ownership, from our management and from myself, that we will do everything we possibly can to make that a reality.

Best regards,


Cam Neely

VTHomeless	41	13	23	"Hey everyone - I was here around two weeks or so ago, asking everyone what they thought about Tim Thomas - Haha it's nice to hear what fans feel about their players, and I loved the type of respect that you had for your players.

Here we are now, after the end of game seven, and I just have to say - This has been arguably the best series that I have ever watched. Yes, it wasn't the Stanley Cup, but it was still the playoffs - We're the first pair of teams to ever have all of the games in our series decided by a margin of one goal. I have so much respect for the Bruins, and your team played great!

I just want to say thanks to all of your fans though - many of you were respectful throughout the entire series, and it has been the most frightening as well. I knew that the series would be close - but this was far closer than I would have ever believed. I loved watching you all in the Stanley Cup last year, and I hope to see you all again (a little later in the playoffs though. Perhaps that would have been possible if we just won one more games, and you would have been facing the Panthers...)

Again, thanks to all of you for a great series!"	t5_2rmt9	True

1321451069.0	mecxy	So I went to the Bruins game last night...	eatmyshortsken	30	5	18	"Firstly, awesome game, these dudes are on fire. Now on with the story.

My friend and I purchased tickets around 3 pm yesterday for 60 bucks a pop. We sat in the balcony Sec. 308 in row 7. Really great seats where the Bruins shot twice. The 1st period comes and goes and my buddy recommends we go meet his friend who has box seats. We pick up our things go and I'm stoked as it is. We basically paid 60 bucks for $250+ seats. However, this was when things got weird/awesome. As I'm sitting in the box with my friend and his friend's family they start talking about the players on a pretty personal level (Ie: Mother telling the daughter she should invite ""Tyler"" over for Thanksgiving, how lovely Patrice's girlfriend is, etc.). I didn't want to be rude and ask how they knew them so I kind of just nodded and carried on with conversation. The game continues and ends and after we leave I asked my friend who they were. As it turns out I was sitting in the Assistant General Manager's personal luxury box without even knowing it.

tl;dr - Began in the balcony, ended up sitting in [Jim Benning's](http://bruins.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=38866) luxury box with his family."	t5_2rmt9	True

These past few weeks have given me an increased appreciation for the Bruins, and Tim Thomas especially, although Chara still scares the crap out of me.

Anyways, I hope tomorrow's game goes well for both teams, and no matter which team wins, we both made it to game 7 of the finals!
