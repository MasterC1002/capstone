Post any recommendations you have, and I'll add to this compiled list later.

EDIT: Updated into groups based on current recommendations, keep them coming!

EDIT 2: I've updated the list and added some more of your suggestions, I've not added some since I can find them in the store, if you can provide links to the web pages I'll add them in. Also if you could include a bit more info about the app it'll help to add to the list.

It's quite interesting to see that there are a lot of Windows 8 App developers here on reddit! Keep up the good work! :D

Also note: You may need your region to be able to find some of these apps, simply go to control panael and change it (thanks [xaueious](http://www.reddit.com/r/windows8/comments/1264ce/recommended_windows_8_apps/c6sn3uk)).

Been using windows 7 for a while and thought it was time to upgrade. I purchased it online for $15 using a coupon that a redditor gave me and did an upgrade install (I requested that the installer keep all my files and apps). I didn't back up anything except for my photos. I have over 50 games on steam and didnt want to back it up because it was well over 400 gigs and i am impatient.
Anyways, since upgrading I have had no problems with anything. All my games and apps work perfectly. I noticed a significant performance improvement in terms of program loading times. 
All my games also work perfectly (Steam). All save files are intact. I noticed some FPS improvement in games like Dark Souls and Borderlands 2. I run an ATI graphics card and there were no issues with drivers. 
For those who were considering upgrading, I would highly recommend it. Had a very positive experience and I am really enjoying the operating system so far.
Please feel free to ask any questions.
Here is a picture of my current desktop, looks wild :D

1364415196.0	1b4qa6	Windows 8 - I used to hate it, now I like it.  Here's my story.	deepblue8163	121	31	93	"There seems to be two camps for windows 8, those who love it and those who hate it.  Neither of which seem to be able to get their point across as to why.  The reason?  No one wants to listen.  If you love Windows 8, teach someone that hates it how to use it.  Explain how it works, donât just tell someone that is confused by the new interface that they just donât get it.  Help them.  If you hate Windows 8, learn how to use it and ask questions if you donât know how to accomplish the task at hand. Donât just sit there and gripe âI want my start buttonâ.

Now for my story.  I hope this helps those that hate Windows 8.  Iâm 50 this year.  Iâve been fascinated by electronics since I was six.  I grew up in the late 60âs and 70âs.  I remember my first transistor radio, the mainstreaming of FM and the Apollo moon missions.  The path from vinyl record to 8-track tape to cassette tape to cd and then mp3.  We had the first microwave oven and the first remote controlled television on the block, not to mention the first color television on the block.  I took electronics in high school and learned how to repair radios and televisions. We got to play with this new chip from TI called the 8088 and learned how to build logic circuits.  I remember the teacher telling us that we would see a time when everyone would have their own personal computer in their home or be able to wear one on their wrist.  Pipe dream back then!

Needless to say, Iâve been interested in âtechâ all my life.  Tech has been my hobby and accounting is where I work.  Iâve been using Windows since Windows 3.1 and have been a part of all the betas.  Iâve loved working on the new versions and looked forward with great anticipation for the newest release of Windows.  That is, until Windows 8.  I downloaded the Consumer Preview and loaded it on a spare hard drive.  Popped it into my laptop and away I went.  Here comes the sound of screeching brakes.  Windows 8?  This sucks!!  What the hell is this Start Screen thing?  Whereâs my desktop?  Where the hell is the damn start button?  How do I shut this piece of crap off?  After about ten minutes of utter frustration, I pulled the hard drive out and went back to my favorite version of Windows.  Windows 7!!!

A few weeks later, I decided I would give this âMetroâ thing another go.  Nope, still the same crap!  Iâm an accountant. I donât give a flying crap about playing games or looking at my pictures or videos.  Keeping up with my friends using the Facebook app?  I have to work!!!  Whereâs my Excel, my Outlook?  What about my business ERP system?  You know, the one I use to run my damn business?  I need a tool, not a toy to run my business.  Play time is nice, but work comes first or we go hungry.  I know, Iâm old schoolâ¦.seems like some people think that play time comes first, but not in my world, and this Windows 8 thing is just not helping me accomplish anything toward that end.

So, the Windows 8 thing went to file 13, or the round file, or the trash canâ¦.whichever you prefer, never to be seen again.  One thing I forgot to mention, Iâm also the IT guy and I do computer repair on the side.  Iâm asked all the time âI want to upgrade to this Windows 8 thing, should I do it?â  Of which my reply has been an astounding NO!!!  Get the crucifix, the holy water, a hammer and a stake.  Kill it, kill it, kill it.  But never say never!  There comes a time when we all have to upgrade our âstuffâ and that time has come for me.  So, I decided one cold and rainy weekend, that I would give this Windows 8 thing another go.  Third timeâs a charm?  I donât know.  I was determined to learn how it worked and make it work for my business.  Friday night, after a long week at work, I downloaded and installed the Windows 8 Enterprise trial.  Ok, hereâs that damn start screen again.  Now what?  Time for Google.  One thing I learned a long time ago about Windows is right click, right click, right click.  Lots of options there.  So, I tried this with Windows 8 and to my surprise, thereâs not much right clicking going on here.  Now what?  Back to Google again.

Saturday, early morning, and back to Windows 8.  Time to grab some business applications and try to get them loaded.  Office is a good start, letâs try that.  Pretty straight forward and Iâve got some new tiles on my start screen.  Letâs try Excel.  Ok, thereâs Excel and my desktop.  Now Iâm starting to feel better.  Whereâs the start button?  Oh yeah, thereâs not one.  How do I get back to the start screen to open Outlook?  Time for Google again.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  Search the internet!!

Those of you that love Windows 8, please make more in depth tutorials and put them online for those of us that donât like Windows 8.  And remember, (this is really important) pick a small subject and explain it in depth.  DO NOT ASSUME that everyone is as smart as you when it comes to understand the inner workings of Windows 8.  Weâre not!  Thatâs the reason weâre looking for information and the one and only reason we hate Windows 8.  Make the subjects small and simple.  We can only eat an elephant one bite at a time. 
 
Now, for the Windows 8 haters.  There is a treasure trove of information on the internet as to how to use Windows 8, but youâve got to dig.  The Windows 8 lovers are really trying to help us, even if we canât see or hear it.  Now get out there and search for the information you need.  I canât stress this enough, LEARN SOMETHING NEW.  It will not kill you.  My first piece of advice is to find a keyboard short cut list.  Itâs the most handy thing youâll find.  The other thing is that this new start screen is just a big start menu that you can customize and make look pretty and hopefully make your work easier.  Once you figure out that the start screen is just a huge version of the start menu, things will start to click.  I donât have much use for the apps and live tiles (you can remove them) but, everything else works pretty well.

So, after Friday night, Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night, I had a pretty good grip on this new Windows 8 thing.  Youâve got to give it more than 30 minutes time and you actually have to learn something, a different way of doing some things.  Itâs not harder or more cumbersome, and in some ways is actually easier than the old ways.  Some things seem to just âflowâ better.  Iâve been using Windows 8 for a couple of months now and I can say that Iâm not a Windows 8 hater anymore and Iâve been recommending it to anyone that asks.  Iâm not quite in the âloveâ category yet, but I do enjoy using Windows 8 and it will work for my business.  I do recommend that the âhatersâ give it an honest try and the âloversâ should help to convert, not belittle the âhatersâ.  Weâre all in this together, so we need to get along and help each other.

TLDR:  I used to hate Windows 8, but now I like it.  Read the story if you want to know more.

""I don't want to have to use my Mouse and Keyboard to navigate a Touchscreen.""

There is a desktop with Windows 8, they didn't just throw the desktop out the window all of a sudden to replace it with MetroUI. There are also numerous start menu mods that make Windows 8 just like using Windows 7 and goes straight to desktop on boot if you don't want to use the MetroUI atall. I am currently using a start menu mod called ""Shell8"" that goes straight to the desktop as I do not want to use the MetroUI and i am absolutely loving Windows 8.

I don't see why windows 8 is getting a bunch of negative press.

Every program I used in windows 7 works exactly the same in Windows 8.

The learning curve wasn't anything daunting. Navigating with a mouse using the corners of the screen is great and speedy. The apps are cool, I don't use most of them though since I'm on a desktop. 

I was also surprised at the ease of upgrading from windows 7 (and a non legit copy at that). I thought it was going to be an endless barrage of errors and incompatibilities, but it worked flawlessly. the only downside is due to the small size of my SSD, I had to delete a few things to free up space for the install. Easily re-installed those though. 

Both my boot time (from completely off to login screen) and my shutdown time were cut about exactly in half.

It is the best operating system I have ever used, and it is so much faster than Mountain Lion. Even though I don't have a touchscreen, the multi-touch trackpad is quite similar in its usability. The Metro apps are really good, in that they give you a lot of relevant information, in a concise manner, with big letter and pretty boxes and colors. The app switching with the upper left-hand corner works well, and the Charms Bar integrates with all apps. The only thing I see people getting confused about is the Desktop mode. Just press the Start button on your computer (or the Command Key in my case, which I often mix up with the Control button in Windows) to get to Desktop. It has a slight learning curve, but when you use it, it is really one of the best products to come out of Microsoft.

Windows 8 is really going to lead the way with tablets. A problem with the iPad and Android tablets is that you can't do actual work on them - they don't run PC apps. PC software is more functional than tablet software, because the menus and other functions help you achieve more things that are necessary. A Windows 8 tablet, somewhat like the Surface Pro, is really a ""Pro"" tablet. It's a tablet for entertainment in Metro when you need it, and a PC laptop when you add a Keyboard and Mouse. If it has HDMI-out, it literally turns into a full-fledged laptop. "	t5_2s692	True

Essentially, it is a volume license purchase plan for companies to use to distribute large quantities to their employees as a ""perk"" for working there. There are a lot of companies that either don't know that they can take advantage of this, or they don't bother telling their employees that they can get Office Pro for $10 (Or Office for Mac, for the same price). It is even mentioned on the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2013#Distribution_changes) page for Office 2013

The price is valid for companies that are part of the Microsoft HUP (Home Use Program). You must enter your company email to qualify. I have also seen school &amp; military emails work for this deal (Military personal would use the .mil email address in the form of @us.af.mil, @us.navy.mil, etc for it to work).

Even if your company email is not working, but you know they are part of HUP. You can get a program code from HR/Admin and enter it in at the program eligibility page.

Then click ""Enter Program Code Manually"" on the right hand sid

Follow these simple steps:

1. http://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/home.aspx?country_id=US&amp;dialect_id=en-US&amp;WT.mc_id=vc885&amp;lookup

2. Enter your work email address to check your company's eligibility.

3. Microsoft will send you an email with a buy link

4. Buy the software, download and Enjoy!.

1365360511.0	1bv6gs	Getting used to Windows 8, now better than my Mac	jonnyvice	67	10	23	"So about a month ago, I spilled a bottle of soda inside my laptop bag and had to have my Mac repaired.  It really irked me because I had just spent money on the Macbook Pro, and two Thunderbolt displays for my office and home.

I had to go out to best buy and pick up a new laptop pronto so I could continue to be mobile and work when needed.  I ended up buying two cheap $400-ish PCs, a Toshiba and an HP Pavilion g7.  

At first I was really frustrated with the Windows 8 experience.  I got a copy of Windows 7 to run on my HP off of our company MSDN account and I installed Ubuntu on my Toshiba.  

It has been an excruciating month, to say the least.  

This last week, I've had some requirements to work on Hyper-V compatibility with our software product so I installed Windows 8 back on the HP and bought a pro pack to get Hyper-V installed.

Now, when I initially tried Windows 8 the first go around I did what all the guides online said to do, get start8, install Office 2010, disable hot corners, etc.  This time around I decided to give it a fair shot on how it was supposed to be used.  I ended up really enjoying the experience!

The metro apps were great for casual consumption (the news app is great and I think I actually like it better than my previous favorite news aggregate app, Pulse), it has some fun games for goofing around (Hyrdo Hurricane makes me feel like I'm 18 again in the arcades, in a *good* way!) and the everything feels a bit faster.

I think a lot of the hate I've seen (and experienced) came from people coming from Windows 7 to an update with no Aero and also people not warming up to the concept of keyboard shortcuts.  Aero looks great, it always did.  But I've grown to like the new desktop theme and it's 2d flatness, as it really makes the application content come out front and center.  The only area that I've seen improved over this period was trying out ModernMix which lets you run metro apps in a window.

Just got my Mac back today and I just don't like the experience as much.  I think I'm going to sell my Mac and apple supplies and get a really nice Windows 8 laptop with an IPS screen.  I have yet to try touchscreen functionality except on some of the demos at best buy and I simply don't think I'm part of the core audience for that. But the rest of the OS I'm really thrilled with, everything just worked, application support (except for our quickbooks machine that scanned in checks) was flawless, and I just really ended up enjoying and preferring the Windows 8 experience to other OSs on the market.

Anyone else come to Windows 8 completely hating it and then came to the same positive conclusion about using it for a length of time?

EDIT:  just to add, the keyboard shortcuts in Windows 8 are what really makes it for me.  While using a mouse and keyboard is still kind of frustrating while getting used to the new OS, I find myself rarely using the mouse anymore.  I can get pretty much wherever I need with minimal fuss using just keyboard shortcuts."	t5_2s692	True
1359855434.0	17s8m1	My brothers and I have been working on a free mini-game collection called Taptitude for nearly 2 years.  We just released it on Windows 8!	brandf	60	8	10	"So this is my hobby project...

Every week we update Taptitude with new mini-games and cross game features.  We started out on Windows Phone with just 10 simple games, but over time it's turned into a huge collection of games (over 70) that are tied together with an in-game economy.

Now we're bringing the fun to Windows 8.  

It's been a lot of work and we offer the full game for free, so I'm hoping my fellow redditors can help us spread the word.

Let me know what you think!

1359918814.0	17ti2x	Can we discuss the role or purpose of the Modern UI on an actual, full-featured x86 computer?	WhatsAPoundsignYOLO	68	19	107	"Does anyone else find that on a real PC--even one with touch--the Modern/Metro UI tends to get in the way more than it helps?  Don't get me wrong, this is not a rant about the start menu or the swipe-in menus or having to re-learn Windows.  If something is changed for the better, I'm willing to go through the learning curve.  

I've been using this OS for the last seven-ish months (since Consumer Preview) and I want to highlight a few points that make me question the role of the Modern UI on an actual PC.  Am I wrong here, or am I just an asshole?

**The Metro UI is a step backwards for multitasking.** 

* You should be allowed to resize things in any arrangement that suits you.  The Metro UI can only show two apps per monitor.  Now, for the sake of argument, lets say two is enough--if you're like me, you probably like to have some sort of reference material on one side and something you're 'creating' on the other.  Why must snapping be limited to the rule of thirds??  Have you ever tried this with IE10 or Chrome?  The text shrinks down to ant-size.  I was so excited to see that Microsoft was going to find a way to deal with the recent abundance of horizontal real-estate that widescreens have created.  But this isn't working for me.
*  Changing focus shouldn't suspend an app unless it makes sense for the app to be suspended.  Don't get me wrong, this makes very good sense on the mobile platforms.  But sometimes I don't want the sound to cut out when I switch applications.  And some applications need to have full bandwidth when they're in the background (this is why there is no Metro bittorrent client yet).  This brings me to my next point:

**Metro apps are underpowered or underfeatured**.  Why does my laptop get so much hotter when I run Chrome in ""Windows 8 Mode?""  Why can't the Metro IE10 display certain websites with flash?  Why haven't we seen an official app from _any_ of the social networks?

**Microsoft's own apps are the biggest source of confusion**.

* Why are there two Control Panels?  And if you're gonna have two Control Panels, why can't they both have access to all of the same settings?
* Why are the Metro versions of Mail, Calendar, and OneNote so barebones?  And don't tell me its because they're free.  I just bought Office 2013 Pro.  All of the programs launch in desktop mode, including Outlook and OneNote!  If Microsoft is so gung-ho about Metro, why didn't they include _any_ Metro apps in Office?"	t5_2s692	True

Throughout all this, I have NEVER used the start menu. I hated it, it was slow to navigate, ugly, and pointless seeing as the search bar was right there. I pinned my apps to the taskbar in Windows 7 a la OS X and anything else was in the main section of the task bar when I opened it. On the rare occasions I needed something else, I just searched it. 

I was genuinely pleased to hear that the start menu was gone, and equally as genuinely surprised that theres been such an outcry. For me, the start screen has added functionality to Windows rather than losing ""productivity"" like most people say.

It is currently in RTM, and I have installed the 90 day Enterprise trial on my main computer to test it out.  Below I have tried to answer most of the complaints and questions about Windows 8 to the best of my ability.  Please comment with any other suggestions.


* ""Windows 8 starts in the start menu and I have to make an extra click to get to the desktop.""

Unless you are going to the desktop to just view the wallpaper, I assume you are going to open a program.  You can just click the tile for that program on the start screen and it will open that program in the desktop automatically.


* ""The new mail/calendar/messaging metro apps suck.""

They are not as feature rich as the Office programs, but that is because they are free.  If you wanted to use all the extra features, just install Office.  You can install the Office 2013 preview for free, which works just fine.  Also, Outlook uses the metro notification system as well.


* ""Turning off the computer is too difficult!""

In windows 7, you opened the start menu, and then clicked the shut-down button.  In windows 8, you click the settings button on the charm bar, then click power, then shutdown.  Or, you can press win+i and then power and shutdown.


* ""There is no clock when using Metro Apps.""

You can view the clock multiple ways.  You can move your mouse to the bottom right corner, and then hover over the charm bar to view the clock, or you can press win+d to view the desktop.  


* ""I can't just find my programs like the start menu in windows 7""

To find your apps, all you need to do is press the windows key, and then start typing.  Yes, it is that simple.


* ""The new menu bar in explorer is horrible.""

You don't have to have the menu bar visible.  You just need to click the up arrow in the upper right corner of the bar to hide it forever.  You can of course reveal it later by pressing that same button.  If you actually want to use it, it has a ton of new and useful features to make the explorer more powerful.


* ""The new desktop theme looks horrible.""

The new theme help try to bridge the gap between windows 7's Aero UI and the new Modern UI.  It does miss some aspects, like the icons, but I believe that it does a nice job bridging this gap.  Also, once it is officially released on Oct 26th, people will start to create new themes for it.


Now I will list all of the new features that I have found that help benefit it above Windows 7.

-Native ISO mounting

-More features/options in explorer

-Better performance

-Smaller footprint on disc

-Faster Searching

-Better touch and gesture support

-More keyboard short-cuts

-System Settings/Personalization sync between PC's

-Better Start Menu management.  (Couldn't customize look of start menu in 7, or sorting of applications)

-Better Multi-Monitor support

-Built-in anti-virus protection

-Task Manager is much more informative and easier to use

-Faster Boot Time

-Easier Licensing system

-Hyper-V

1357694518.0	167wzj	My thoughts on Windows 8 on both a Desktop and a Windows 8 laptop 	Hutty590	52	9	23	"So I've had Windows 8 running on my desktop for about a month now, and I managed to save enough money (thanks to to Christmas) to get myself a Lenovo Yoga 13 as a laptop. So I thought I'd share my thoughts on the OS on both here. 
   
**Desktop:**

* Like many others I thought I would hate not having a start button, but it's seriously easier and faster to just use the keyboard to navigate to it 

* I have a dual monitor set up and I have it so my start screen (and all Windows Apps) to open on the secondary monitor only. My main monitor is almost always just the desktop unless I'm watching Netflix 

* I have never had a slight problem with Steam or any of my games. I had them all saved on one of my hard drives, and I just set up Steam to save the games from there. No issues what so ever  

* I do find the charms menu to be bit annoying at times, but I rarely use it so it's not a real complaint I suppose 

* Booting up my computer is crazy fast now which is nice, things do seem to be a bit faster all around (but that may also be due to a clean install) 

* Final thoughts: I like Windows 8 on my desktop, although I do use it more like I did before with Windows 7, utilizing the desktop the most. I am a fan of the Start screen however, especially when you set it up the way you want. 

**Laptop (Lenovo Yoga 13):**  

* I'll try to keep this more about Windows 8 than the laptop itself (which is great by the way) 

* Windows 8 with a touchscreen laptop is AWESOME. I love it. This is clearly the way it was meant to be. 
* Unlike with my Desktop, I actually find myself using Windows Apps much more. I use Chrome in Windows 8 mode, I use Redhub for Reddit etc. A lot of this has to do with the touchscreen. Switching from one app to another is fast and easy, and honestly quicker than if I were to use the icons from the taskbar in Desktop mode. 
* Using the multitasking options is nice, especially when listening to music (although good music apps is seriously lacking) 
* Again, Steam has worked perfectly fine on this laptop as well. Playing Civ 5 in touchscreen mode is great. 
* Final Thoughts: Compared to using it on my desktop, I actually feel like I'm using Windows 8 on my laptop instead of just Windows 7 with a few improvements. Its a huge difference, and makes it completely clear what Microsoft was intending with this OS. Like I said before, Windows 8 is good on my desktop, I don't feel any hindrance when using it, and it does actually make things easier in some respects. However, on a touchscreen device its clearly better. You can take full advantage of what Windows 8 has to offer, and once the app ecosystem gets better (hopefully is does!) it'll be even better. 

TL;DR - I like Windows 8 on my desktop. I love Windows 8 on my touchscreen laptop.

I performed a clean installation on all of the PCs and loaded Office 2013 on all of them to work with our Office 365 subscription.

After I upgraded all the PCs, I worked my way back around to each PC to install the network printers so everyone could be back up and running after the holiday.  To my amazement, Windows 8 automatically discovered the printers on the network and installed the appropriate drivers!

This really left me quite impressed as I didn't have to perform my usual ritual of manually discovering the network printer and hunting the manufacturer's website for the latest driver.  Sure, it's a small thing, but Windows 8 truly saved me time and effort.

As a side note, I'm also amazed at the speed of Windows 8's installation. I was able to get from formatting the drive to first boot in 15 minutes.  That's a far cry from the Windows XP days when an OS install would take a minimum of an hour and a half."	t5_2s692	True

After 21 days in certification (we didn't fail cert, the app just fell through the cracks and wasn't assigned to a tester until I called up the certification support team... fun times), a reddit app that a friend and I have been working on is finally in the store. 

/r/etro is our attempt to build a fast, dark, and minimal reddit client. The version that's in the store allows you to perform all the functions we consider core to using reddit. Voting, commenting, jumping to a subreddit you're not subscribed to, saving/hiding, submitting links, etc. 

We also thought a ton about making the app as usable as possible. We didn't like how having an upvote and downvote button on every comment looked; but we didn't want to force the user to click on a comment and then vote up or down. We added this nifty little feature where if you just tap (or click) on the solid bar on the left side of the comment we'll upvote or downvote the comment (we even color in the bar with orangered or blue so you know what you've done). No need to put a click between you and the person you need to downvote into oblivion :)

We also added support for drafts. I tend to write something, then look through the rest of the comments, think about what I wrote, and submit it later. In /r/etro, when you compose a comment you have the option to save as a draft. The comment sits in the thread where we'd post it and lets you indecisive redditors go back and decide when you want to subject your masterpiece to the horde.

My co-developer tends to browse reddit by opening a ton of links in tabs and then reading all those stories at once. Most reddit apps force you to read articles one by one. If you're like my friend, we've added the ability to dock the app to the side of your screen (snap view) and whenever you click on a link we'll open a modern IE window for you. If you click on another link we open a new tab. This way you can just open a ton of articles and read them in IE whenever you want to.

We also added the ability to navigate through the interface with VIM directional commands. Because... yeah, we're nerds.

We also custom designed the home screen to fill one purpose, give you a high level view of what's happening in your subreddits. The home screen shows you ~10 articles from your subreddits so that you get a good idea of what's going on. This process works really well for those of us with a ton of text-heavy subreddits that don't waste space with huge squares on our homepages.

We also allow you to collapse titles and comment threads with a double tap or click.

One bit of feedback we saw from some people was that they wanted a dark theme and for the app to be really readable (more people than I thought wanted to reddit on their tv) so we optimized everything for fingers and mice. Text is large and readable, everything is very finger friendly (but not to the point where it's annoying to use with a mouse).

Since our app got lost in certification and it ended up taking 21 days, we already have a v2 almost ready with some awesome functionality. We gutted most of the caching and retrieval logic in the app and now it's disgustingly fast. We're adding support for graying out articles you've read and adding a user page that shows articles, messages, etc. There are a ton of little changes happening then too, but these are the biggest ones.

I hope you'll give the app a try! The Windows Store listing is below..

More specifically, they don't know how important the right click/cross slide is. For instance, I just got this two-star review:
	
"". . . I would want to up vote a story from the main page as I do a lot of times, but Snoo doesn't let me. Agreed that I only looked at it for 5 minutes, but those 5 minutes didn't change my mind about giving up using reddit in chrome with RES."" - Vaibhav
	
But I **DO** let you. You just have to right click/cross select a story in accordance with Windows 8 UI guidelines. I'm certain that I'm not alone in this. The new Hulu app, for instance, is heavily reliant on the cross slide gesture. It is also sort of foreboding, given hat those who would have Windows 8 at this point should be rather technically adept. I fear for what will happen when average people get their hands on it.
	
My plan is to add a first launch message that will inform people about the cross slide/right click gesture in Windows 8 to my next update. Are any other developers seeing this issue, or have any other ideas regarding how to solve it?

[What does a custom Metro screen look like?](http://i.imgur.com/zHxTo.png)  Image courtesy of CapnCrunch10.

**The Guide**

First, you need to download a standalone program called [OblyTile](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1899865)

Before you start making tiles, plan out how you want the icons laid out and have some icons ready. For each program you will need at least one icon that is 120x120 or larger and, optionally, a 30x30 icon, larger icons can be used, this may cause distortions of the icon. A good idea is to have your icons and OblyTile in the same folder, this will save time on navigation.

Now, with your strategy in hand, open OblyTile and start creating! Once you're done, get back into Metro and start organizing your icons. You can further your sweet [ass-grid](https://xkcd.com/37/) by adding group names to the top of the group. To do this, you need to zoom out in Metro (CTRL+Scroll Wheel or +/-) and right click on a group.

**OblyTile input fields explained.**

* Tile Name is what you will see in plain text over the tile.
* Hide Tile Name will hide the plain text name if you wish to only see the icon.
* Program Path is the path to open the executable file.
* Program Arguments are commands the program will take into account while open, we will talk more about explorer arguments later.
* Tile Image is the large image you see in Metro
* Tile Small image is what you see when you zoom out in Metro (CTRL+Scroll Wheel or +/-)
* Tile Background Color set the background of your icon. This will be the background of open space from you icon (transparent areas, areas not covered by the icon, and the preview screen.)
* Run as administrator will make the tile launch the application with administrator permissions.

**Shell Folders**

These folder are unique in the sense they con't have a direct path (such as Computer, Libraries, Network, etc) When you create a new icon, set the Program Path to ""C:\Windows\explorer.exe"" (or whever windows is installed) then set the Program Arguments to [one of these arguments](http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/shell-commands-to-access-the-special-folders/). If you wish to have an icon to a specific folder or drive, just use the path to its location.

**Power Buttons**

This is a list of the *program path*::*program arguments* for the tile to work properly.
 
* Shutdown Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -s /hybrid -t 00
* Restart Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -r -t 00
* Log off Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -l (Note: that is a lowercase L)
* Hibernate Computer: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** powrProf.dll,SetSuspendState
* Sleep Computer: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0
* Lock Workstation: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** User32.dll,LockWorkStation

Not a big deal if you're tapping the screen, but the problem with edgy swipes is that throwing away the first 100ms means Windows may not see the first packet of data until your finger's already inside the screen - thus missing edgy entirely, and resulting in a pan or tap near the edge. Not ideal.

The solution is to disable selective suspend for the touch screen, which means it will only get put into the idle state when the screen turns off. Yes, this will decrease battery life a bit, but I haven't noticed a significant change personally. And you can always change it back!

The way to disable it is a simple registry change. Make the change below, then restart your computer (shutting down is not enough due to Windows 8's hybrid shutdown - pick ""Restart"" from the power options).

If you're interested in more information, there's a [paper on it here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh974604). Be warned, it's pretty technical.

This information applies to other Intel touch-enabled computers as well, but I don't know the precise registry path for them. If you're having problems with other devices, let me know and I'll try to help.

**How to test if you are affected by this:**

1. Close all applications, unplug everything from your computer.
2. Touch the computer's screen.
3. Count to 10, slowly (i.e., wait for 10 seconds). Do not touch the computer during this time - you're waiting for the touch controller to idle out.
4. Try to perform an edge swipe.

If it works, great! If not, and you want to fix it, follow the instructions below.

**Registery Change:**

1. Open regedit.exe and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`.
2. There should then be a key named `VID_04F3&amp;PID_000A` (along with some other similar-looking keys). This key represents the USB touch controller. Open it.
3. There should be one key under the previous one. On my system, it's `6&amp;2e2f5def&amp;0&amp;5`, but I don't know if it's machine-specific. Open it, then click `DeviceParameters`.
4. There should be a key named `SelectiveSuspendEnabled` whose value is `1`. Set its value to `0`.
5. Restart!
6. Follow my above instructions again to verify the problem is gone.

Let me know if this helps you! It made my Yoga about 1000x more enjoyable once I made the change.

EDIT: As /u/miguelos pointed out, Lenovo also released a hotfix for the Yoga's bad partitioning. The fix removes the D: drive, among other things, making the C: drive 100GB (when I ran it right after getting the Yoga, I was left with around 75GB free after default applications and the OS).

1352600610.0	12zpoe	A look at the Zune software vs XBox music; or why XBox music blows 	Scythels	37	8	18	"This post is only concerned with the ways the two softwares allow you to interact with your music library, the cloud services between them are by-and-large the same, and the more gimmicky features like the ""pinned artists"" on the quickplay screen of the zune software I don't use.  

Let's start by taking a look at the Zune software's 'home' screen for me, or my collection after a fresh import of about 17GB of music from my desktop to my laptop:

[I'm greeted with a smart and effective 3-column design.](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#0) Some pieces of album art didn't make it over and were substituted with the cloud art (that is wrong) or received no art at all.  That's fine, I can add a few pieces in by hand if I really want, but those albums I have not listened to in a long time and don't care about enough to update.  The columns are variable-width and work really, really well on a desktop.  They hold a ton of information and are really space-effective.  If I start typing, it starts automatically bringing me to what I was typing for, so if I type ""Guilt"" in, I am brought to Guilt Machine automatically as I have no other music involving the word Guilt, if it finds nothing it brings me to search results.  

[Now, look how I'm greeted when I enter XBM](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#2).  Bleh.  Huge areas of wasted space, a massively shitty UI to navigate, and generally very poor usability.  

Now, I have a Zune HD, so there was some basic functionality continuity I was expecting here.  I clicked an artist name (in this case, AC/DC) expecting a set of tiles with letters on them that I could tap to jump to that letter come up.  Nope, you have to scroll.  Meaning if you have a larger library, it's a bitch to navigate.  The visual cue is [there](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#3) just like it is on the Zune HD, but the functionality is not.  

Now, there are of course [other ways](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#4) to sort stuff, and each primary category except artist and smartDJ has sub-ways to sort.  

Oh yeah, there's the #1 failure of the software to me.  When you find an artist [after scrolling all the fucking way down here with no quick cue as to what letter you are at if you scroll quickly](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#5) and finally [select an artist](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#6), the songs are alphabetized.  For some, this isn't an issue.  But for me, it's usage breaking.  I know what I want to listen to when I go into my player and I've formed a habit of going artist -&gt; album -&gt; play first song and the album starts playing.  On XBM I need to go albums -&gt; sort by artist and then get to [here](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#11) just so I can get the album I want.  It takes far longer and is much less precise.  I get that XBM is developed for touch too, but for mouse+keyboard this sucks.  But wait, it says that a bunch of those albums are ""Rock"" while the rest are metal operas.  This is peculiar, because those albums have metadata that says [they are in fact metal operas](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#12).  Expecting that to be a sync issue or something, I close and restart the app.  Still says rock.  So I go to edit the data because that will bother my OCD, finding no option, while in the zune software it's just [right click -&gt; edit](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#9) which brings up a lovely little [full-featured](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#10) metadata editing area.  Now, because of how Zune handles album playing and how visible it is that you are just playing 'down' from that pink text that is highlighted, it is very easy to see what is playing when you play an album.  Even if you are not familiar with it, you can see what's left of the album.  On XBM, you have to go through [this clusterfuck](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#16) which has artists on ""now playing"" that certainly are not and are not even artists I would like if you looked at my library.  Where did they come from?  


Now, once I've finally gotten to my album and I [click play on the first track.](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#13) expecting the album to play all the way through.  Nope, just the one song.  (by the way, getting this far was [this easy](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#7) in the Zune software.


Anyway, now I get to 'now playing' and [still can't see any more than the current song](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#14).  Now I get it, it's being pretty, and Zune behaves similarly, but in Zune I just click a list icon and a list comes up that does not obscure the visualization, where in [XBM](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#15) a large, overly padded list comes up.  


Why Microsoft, why?  Zune is an excellent piece of software, why did it become XBM, a piece of shit nearly unusable thing?  Why couldn't you just tweak Zune a bit or add a switch to flip between desktop and touch UIs?  Oh well, guess no metro music application for me.

1354109259.0	13xk9z	It's always the little things...	Thaliur	35	4	29	"Hello r/win8,

By now, most of us probably found out about the big changes in Windows 8, like the new interface, user account synchronisation (which is awesome, by the way), and several performance improvement.

What about tiny, almost unnoticeable changes, though? There must be some. Maybe even some we already made use of but did not think about.

One example from me: Up to Windows 7, whenever I wanted to shut down my laptop, I had to wait until it was really shut down. If I closed the lid too early, it went into standby mode, and continued shutting down when I woke it up again. Windows 8 seems to ignore everything once the shutdown process has started, which means that when I leave at work, I press the power button, close the laptop, and when I am done packing, it will be off or almost off, and I can just grab the bag and leave, where I had to leave it open for shutdown before I could close the bag with Windows 7.

So what about you? Anything tiny that makes you like Windows 8 a little bit more than you'd do without it?"	t5_2s692	True

XP was better in almost every way compared to Windows 98SE, but 98SE was the dominant operating system of the time. Some 98SE users knocked the Windows XP interface, calling it too simple or child-like because it had bright colors. Others said that they ""didn't see why they needed to switch"" or ""what can XP do that 98 can't"" and so forth. When new software and hardware came out that required XP and explicitly didn't support 98SE, the holdouts were upset that Microsoft was trying to ""lock them out"" of their OS. 

But a few years later, everyone loved XP.

Flash forward to 2009. You saw the same debate between the XP and the 7 crowd, down to the same exact arguments. Again, Windows 7 was objectively better than XP at many tasks. (XP has it's uses, but Win7 surpassed it.) A few years later, everyone loved 7.

Now look at 2012/2013. History repeats itself again. I have no doubt that by 2016, you'll have most people defending Windows 8 against whatever Windows 9 turns out to be.

The only fluke in this cycle was Vista, which did suffer from some problems that made it an objectively bad choice.

**Tons of new features!**

In this update, I've addressed a lot of my initial feedback. Some highlights:

* **You can now view comments in Preview Mode!** The full array of commenting features (like changing sorting) are still only available on the dedicated Article Page, but the basics are now exposed to Preview Mode. Most importantly, this means that self-posts no longer load reddit.com in an iframe in this view (or any).
* **I handle more reddit.com links internally!** This means that when you click on a post in r/bestof, I'll display the content natively, rather than in an iframe. There's still work to be done in this area (notably, links in comments that point to reddit.com), but that'll be addressed later.
* **You can change the color scheme!** Don't like the various blues that I use? Change them!
* **User pages!** You can now view your own user page in the Accounts dropdown, or anyone else's by selecting a link/comment.
* **Quick actions!** I've made it easier to do common actions like upvote, downvote, etc. When you mouseover a story/comment, I'll show a couple links for those sorts of actions, making them one click away. For touch, I've added options to customize the swipe-select and double-tap behavior, so you can, for instance, make the app bar appear on left-swipe, but upvote on right-swipe.
* **The app remember links you've visited!** I'll gray out the title of stories once you've visited them. I also added an appbar command to un-visit a link if you don't want to forget to look at it later. History should roam between computers, but the syncing isn't perfect yet.
* **Performance increases!**. The app performs a lot better on devices like the Surface.
* **Load more comments!** As you scroll, I'll auto-load more comments, and I've added links to load more replies for a specific comment.
* **Fixed the blank-screen-on-launch bug!** I had a terrible bug involving the Store's ""app was installed!"" toast that would put my app in a bad state where it only showed a blank page. I finally tracked down the issue and fixed it. PM me if you're interested in the technical side =)

And this is just a partial list! The full list can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_to_go/comments/11si5c/change_log/). 

I encourage you all to download it and try it out! Leave feedback if you want anything added/changed. A lot of stuff in this version was the direct result of feedback I've received. And go Pro! if you love the app! No, there still aren't any Pro-specific features. I've been prioritizing features for everyone first. Going Pro! right now lets you show your support, encourage future development, and get in while the price is its cheapest.

BaconSync also allows has a ""chrome-to-phone"" style url push system where users can send web pages directly from their browser to their phones.

Since I am not making a Windows 8 app, I would like to offer all devs making a reddit app for Windows 8 to hook into this service. The service is completely free, no cost to you or your users. It uses a very simple and lightweight API that is very easy to use. 

I think it would be really cool to see users syncing their reddit accounts between phone, tablet, and desktop.

For more info on BaconSync [click here](http://www.quinndamerell.com/Baconit/BaconSync/), and if you are interested please PM me and I will send you what you need to know! Thanks!

Start-up times are embarrassing - we're talking ~10 seconds with Windows 8 and nearly 2 minutes with Windows 7.  

To be fair to Windows 7, nothing will replace the traditional Start Menu, but Windows 8.1's update does help a bit.

I consider myself a active user rather than a passive 'consumer' (I mainly use computers to do research, to write code and write documentation), and I was wondering how I should get the most out of this new operating system on a computer that does not support touch. 

Sure, Windows 8 looks fancy and it has some performance increases built into it under the hood. But I can't for the life of me imagine what kind of apps I'd use (which all seem designed for ""passive use"" to me). So far, I always switch to the Desktop to do my work. Am I missing something?  In the [recommended apps thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/windows8/comments/1264ce/recommended_windows_8_apps/) I don't see anything *useful*.

Just wanted to share that once again, we've been busy adding more features to ReddHub - it's definitely getting close to having the entire reddit experience!

ReddHub v 5.7 is now approved and will be live in the store soon. If you have any comments or feedback, checkout http://www.reddhubwin8.com or /r/reddhub !

Some new features -


**Subreddit pane UX tweaks and 'shortcuts' feature**

The subreddit pane has now been [cleaned up a bit](http://i.imgur.com/CDEz1WA.png) to support the shortcuts feature. The new shortcuts feature looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/af7OQ8j.png), and allows you to both add subreddits you are not subscribed to, as well as combine multiple subreddits, such as apple and Microsoft into a 'technology' subreddit. Shortcuts will be at the top of your list.

**Instapaper support added to reduce crashing and speed up page loads, UX tweaks**

A pain point of the app has always been slow performance/crashing caused by loading webpages in the the Windows 8 webview. We cant fix the webview, but we can improve the experience! To do this, we've added instapaper support, which will load a trimmed down fast version of the page. This is enabled/disabled by the 'simple' checkbox at the bottom of a page. Take a look [here to see it in action](http://i.imgur.com/HNsZt5a.png)

**Messages cleanup and context**

As you may know, messages have also been a sour point in the app. This is now improving, with a slightly  new look and a fixed 'context' button that now works as you'd expect. The old one looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/mgseFOA.png) and the new one looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aoPBtIb.png)

**Full Features List**

* added subreddit shortcuts! - You can now combine subreddits and add to your list without logging in or subscribing
* Reduced crashing - Added a 'simplified' option for loading webpages with instapaper for improved perf/readability
* Fixed context links to show where link came from, also added highlighting
* Added caching to the comment panel incase you switch away
* Added padding to paragraphs for improved readability
* Performance improvements by upgrading various libraries
* Added comments link for share
* Added a more-&gt;close option to close an opened link

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed bug where switching between albums fast would sometimes destabilize app
* Fixed bug where progress bar would not start correctly when navigating within a page
* Fixed bug where a specific comment highlighting color was off
* Prettied up messages panel
* Lots of UI tweaks

1361755335.0	195x3i	"[Windows 8 Desktop Discussion] Primary issue with ""Metro Apps"" on the desktop (multiple monitors)"	PredictsYourDeath	23	3	23	"Hello all!

First off, I apologize for making another one of these threads, but this issue has plagued my otherwise enjoyable experience with Windows 8. I still love windows 8, I recommend it over windows 7, but I have 3 monitors in my battlestation and the new Start Screen and Metro Apps are inherently incompatible with this setup.

1. The first issue, as many of you have pointed out, is that you can only run a single ""metro app"" at any time. This would be fine, except that THIS INCLUDES THE START SCREEN!!!! WTF?! I like to use the Netflix metro app on my right screen while working, but whenever I press the windows button or otherwise navigate to the start screen, it must always stop my netflix app and use that screen. Is there a work around for this? As it stands, I can't even use a single metro app because it gets interrupted when accessing the start screen.

2. There doesn't seem to be a reliable way to make a single screen the one that gets used for the start screen. Why can't the start screen open on whichever monitor I currently have my mouse on? Instead, it seems to default to a non-specific monitor each time I access it. This makes it difficult as programs on the desktop ""remember"" which monitor they open on. For example, my outlook program will always open on the right monitor. As previously-mentioned, I usually have Netflix open on my right-monitor. These features clash, and I often have programs opening behind the ""start-screen"" or other metro apps. I'll try to open a pdf file from my mail app, and it opens behind the mail app and it appears to me that nothing has happened at all.

In conclusion, it appears that using even a single metro app is an unpleasant experience because I have to ""game"" the limitations into not interfering with my user experience. If metro apps have a place in the future of desktop workstations, they need to remove the artificial limitation of only being able to run a single metro app in ""full-screen mode"" at a time. That limitation makes sense in the mobile platform (not really but w/e) but there is no reason to have that on a desktop machine. I have 3 screens and I can't even use one of them for metro apps because then I can't use the start screen, which makes me lose the ability to search, change settings, open new applications, etc.

Am I missing something here?"	t5_2s692	True
1361206623.0	18raxk	Microsoft, Windows, and the (lack of?) proper terminology.	Edg-R	27	7	13	"I decided to make this post for the sole purpose of sharing ideas and/or educating each other, feel free to chime in.

I'm aware that Microsoft's lack of universal terminology as well as UIs for their own software/hardware are nothing new. One of the most apparent problems lately, seems to be with the proper terminology for an app vs an application.

Lets say person A has a Microsoft Surface RT ([Previously known as Microsoft Surface with Windows RT](http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-changes-names-of-surface-tablets-on-website)) and is able to download apps from the Windows Store. 

Now lets say that person B has a desktop with Windows 8, and is also able to download apps from the Windows Store.

I've seen quite a few people and websites using the term ""app"" interchangeably. For example, an article I saw earlier was titled ""Top 10 Windows 8 apps"".

Now what exactly does that mean? *If they're Windows 8 apps, would they work on Windows RT?*  Are they apps from the Windows Store? Or are they *desktop* applications for Windows 8?

Apparently it was the latter, so I wasted time reading the introduction of that article. I can't install desktop applications on my Surface RT, I can only install Windows Store apps on it. 

So my question is... Can we decide on a proper term to use? Such as:

* Application
* App

Or

* Windows application
* Windows Store app

Or 

* Desktop app
* Modern app

Now keep in mind, that the term ""app"" within the Windows OS has only been put to use since Windows 8 came about. 

Would you call Microsoft Office 2013 an app? How about Adobe Creative Suite or Autodesk's AutoCAD? It seems weird called them apps doesn it? 

In my mind, shortening the word application to ""app"" signifies a mobile or light version of an application.

Take Office OneNote for example.

* Microsoft Office OneNote 2013 would probably be seen as an application
* Microsoft OneNote MX (From the Windows Store) would probably be seen as an app

Anyways, just rambling thoughts this morning. 

EDIT: 

From the Oxford dictionary:

&gt;**App**
&gt;
&gt;Pronunciation: /ap/
&gt;
&gt;noun
&gt;
&gt;Computing
&gt;
&gt;a self-contained program or piece of software designed to fulfil a particular purpose; an application, especially as downloaded by a user to a mobile device:


**TL;DR: What is the proper term for a desktop application vs a Windows Store app? People seem to use the word ""app"" interchangeably and it seems to lead to confusion.**

**What exactly is a ""Windows 8 app""? If it's an app, would it work on Windows RT, which only supports Windows Store apps? Or are they desktop apps for Windows 8?**"	t5_2s692	True

This is not a question this a help for others on how to change Live Account name in Windows 8 and keep your windows 7 settings.

I misspelled my email when I first made my Live Account for windows 8. I got all my settings and programs transferred from Windows 7, but it was to a email that didn't exist.

I found that the best way to solve this is to do the following:

**Go to Settings (move mouse to the upper right corner) &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; User &gt; Switch to local account  
Log off and on to the local account.  
Go to the same setting and ""Switch to live account"", now make a new live account with the right email.**


If you just make a new account without using the switch function you will not get your settings transferred with you.

I see it as good maintenance to delete the live account you created at first, but I don't think you have to.

This just came into my spam folder and I must say it's a very unique piece of junk mail.  It's not my usual junk pills or money from some rich person in Africa, this one is worth sharing.  

*********************************
Windows 8 is a lousy Operating System. Its supposed improved performance and claims of improved battery life are exaggerrated, Windows Store is a shameless attempt to pump people for money, and the user interface changes decrease productivity. It is a poor product created for the sake of getting money from your pockets into theirs while offering you as little value as possible. Security is not much different - most exploits and malware that work for earlier Windows versions will still work on Windows 8. One thing that might not work well on it is you, because they switched the interface around so that you have new computer skills to learn. It doesn't really matter whether you want to buy it anyway, because sooner or later it will probably be forced on you by hardware manufacturers.

Windows 8 is a shameless marketing ploy, introduced just in time for the ""holiday shopping season"", which is another big scam. There is nothing ""Holy"" about it, because ""Christmas"" is a big lie.

Excerpts from **URL Removed for safety's sake**

""Xmas has absolutely nothing to do with God. It was originally called Yuletide, which is a pagan festival from the Babylonian Mystery religion of SUN worship. The Babylonians were merchants (they were the originators of the ""Market-system"" which is condemned by God) and they used Yuletide to sell their merchandise because, like today, it made them lots of money.""

""SANTA CLAUS is an anagram for SATAN.""

""The fact that the three kings came to pay homage, and brought gifts of great wealth, was used by Satan to give, to those who perverted the teaching, the idea to continue and even increase the sales of their merchandise (a great marketing-exercise for them). So the virgin-birth was hijacked and corrupted into a time to make lots of money, using the ultimate in ""high-pressure sales techniques"", which was to falsely use God's Son's name, in order to embarass people, who couldn't afford to buy gifts, to go into debt or steal in order to buy their merchandise. By doing this the rich merchants ruin the lives of the poor, driving them further into debt and poverty or crime, whilst making themselves richer and richer.""

Do you want to give more of your hard-earned money to an opulent mega-corporation? Do you want to serve satan? Don't fall for the cheap con-artist tricks of the Windows peddlers.

And yes it is difficult to adjust to initially (took me 40 minutes). I have and heard nothing but alarmist warnings that it is going to ostracize their current audience and no one is going to upgrade.

The tech writers like to focus on small issues that in the greater scheme of things really arenât a problem. No start button!! Wellâ¦ not really true, you push the windows key and type and windows search finds what you want, just like Windows 7. Whoever was still clicking Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Program &gt; Program.exe was doing it wrong and now they wonât be able to get it wrong. There is no choice. All programs are displayed either from the metro tile home screen or you can simply search all apps. All while using touch.

Windows 7 already had touch! Yes it did, fully supported touch but much like the original windows tablets there is no point having a touch interface when the whole operating system is designed to be used with a mouse and keyboard.

I donât want touch! Yes. Yes you do. If you have ever used an iPad, you want touch. It is intuitive to reach out and interact with what is in front of you, not to search around for a pointing device. And when you do need the accuracy, being able to use a mice is great.

It also has Kinnect support, sit on your couch and use your pc without touching a thing purely through using your arms. And not just use your pc, but have an immersive experience that is easy to navigate and completely optimised from the ground up for touch and interaction with gesture based systems and not the traditional mouse and keyboard.

I think some tech writers are caught in a features game where by it's all about better hardware and marginally more functional software. Microsoft have gone back to the drawing board and thrown out the traditional rules that have us cemented in a certain way of doing things not because it is the best way but because it is the most familiar. And much like they did with the hugely under rated Windows Phone 7, put function over endless features and icons.

Itâs not good enough to keep doing things the same way because thatâs the way we do it. Windows XP &amp; 7 are fantastic operating systems but itâs no longer good enough to keep churning out things that are mildly better, itâs time to do something different and try something new.

Do yourself a favour and wait till you use Windows 8 before you write it off or join the chorus of voices who are speaking from a view point that completely misses what has been achieved in this innovative, fresh way of using a computer."	t5_2s692	True

They seem to have very similar specs, the only major difference being the SoC (Tegra 3 vs Snapdragon S4); the Snapdragon seems to be a bit slower in some regards, but nothing major (especially considering the price difference).  $500 for a Windows RT tablet is not a good deal in my opinion, but $300 is quite reasonable; I paid $250 for my 8 GB Nexus 7.  I'm thinking hard about picking one up but just wanted to see if I was missing something obvious.

&gt;*Uninstalling Windows Store is not supported. However, by the screenshots we see that the Windows Store is missing. Follow these methods and check if it helps:*

**Method 1:**

Refer to the link and try to install the update rollup for Windows 8:
Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 update rollup: May 2013
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2836988

**Method 2:**

You may try to reset the Store cache and note down if you get any error message:

*a.     Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.

(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)

*b.    Enter âRunâ without quotes in the search box, tap or click Apps, and then tap or click Run.

*c.     Type âWSReset.exeâ without quotes and press Enter.

*d.    Now test the issue.

**Method 3:**

I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists.

I skipped Method 1 because I already have the update installed. I did Method 2 and I was able to Access the Store App but there's still no App shortcut to Pin to the Metro Start Menu

And now I want to swap out the original HDD for a Samsung 840 Pro 128GB SSD and install a fresh version of Windows 8 on it.

I know that I can use a Windows 8 ISO and the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool in order to install Windows 8 from a USB drive.

So I go to [Microsoft's website](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only) in order to get an ISO. But when I run the setup and enter my product key, I get ""This product key cannot be used to install a retail version of Windows 8"" (Since my product key was not on a sticker on my machine, I had to find it using [Belarc's](http://www.belarc.com/index.html) software).

Is there a reason why I can't get a Windows 8 ISO from Microsoft having just purchased a pre-installed Windows 8 laptop?

Second quick question: can I use a recovery drive I've made on a USB drive to perform a fresh installation of Windows on my new SSD? My initial attempts have also failed: ""Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing.""

1350975831.0	11xo5p	Windows 8: What's wrong with full-screen apps?	PBNkapamilya	28	9	66	"I've read one too many complaints/gripes/whines about Windows 8, but the one that really gets on my nerves is those on the full-screen Metro apps.

""We don't need full-screen apps!,"" they say. To which I respond: ""Why?""

I can distinctly remember people having issues with apps with a lot of ""chrome"" on them. (""Chrome,"" for the purposes of this discussion, refers to the bars that are seen on top or bottom of apps, such as name bars, toolbars, etc. It does *not* refer to Google Chrome in any way; in fact, it's quite ironic that Google Chrome started the revolution in chrome-less web browsing.) Hence the movement among many web browsers to lessen the chrome and give their more screen real estate.

Then Windows 8 with its full-screen apps comes along, and people are griping about it. Apparently, they don't need the full screen real estate, the same one they demanded from web browsers. What's with all the hypocrisy?

I'll tell you why Windows 8 chose to have full-screen apps: **more functionality, less chrome**. Full-screen apps offer its users more space to experience the apps' full functionality and gives up chrome that users don't even bother to look at, let alone use (if it is even useful). It is more visually appealing, and forces developers to be more creative in their app design without using chrome.

So tell me: **What's with all the hate on full-screen apps?**"	t5_2s692	True

I have searched the web and the general consensus seems to be, you now need to do two things to access the BIOS:

1. Disable fast start-up, or 
2. Select advanced start up under 'general settings', restarting and then choosing UEFI

I have tried both of these options and neither has helped. Disabling fast start-up seems to have made no obvious change. When using advanced start-up, restarting and selecting the UEFI option under advanced options is not possible, as it doesn't exist!

I have also tried:

- CMOS Reset (i get message to press F1 then a blank screen, then windows 8 loads)
- Remove windows 8 Drive and Reset CMOS (I get message to press F1 then a blank screen)
- Downgrading / upgrading BIOS (no change)

So even with my OS drive unplugged im unable to:

- Boot from DVD or USB
- Access the BIOS

Microsoft support has told me, contact ASUS. A reply to my posing on the ASUS forum basically said... 'check out this video', which was unfortunately little help (http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-8-boots-too-quickly-first-world-os-problem).

Please offer help if you can... i'm loosing my mind.

please be aware that under the advanced startup options in windows 8, I do not have 'Use a device' (even though I have a correctly formatted USB drive plugged in), or the 'UEFI Firmware Settings' option.

1354749870.0	14cn6c	Thanks to you all, /r/etro version 1.5 is finally in the Windows Store	ddeverill	22	6	16	"So, as you can tell from the title, version 1.5 of /r/etro is finally in the Windows Store. 

Before I dive into all the changes and features we've added I wanted to take a second to thank all the people that left feedback and helped us to find issues with the app. You've all been super supportive and helpful, and the app wouldn't be as solid as it is now if it wasn't for all of you. I know it's sappy, but thanks everyone.

Now for the changes...

- We've added fixes for all the most common crashes that people have encountered, the app should be really stable now.

- We gutted and re-wrote a TON of the code that interfaces with reddit and caches that information. As a result, the app is super fast. People commented on the speed of the app before, it should be even faster now. 

- A lot of people love the homescreen, we've made it even better by displaying cached information on the homescreen and swapping it out as we get content from reddit. This should stop you from seeing a blank homepage until reddit decides to serve us information. In its current state, it may make you wait until the first few subreddits are loaded, but that's only on first launch and it improves the experience on every subsequent launch.

- We got a ton of feedback around selftext not displaying properly, our fix for this is in this release. You should see selftext everywhere (unless it's not supposed to be there)!

- The app now grays out content that you've already read so that you know what's new on your feeds. Next step, baconsync support!

- You can now sort subreddit content by new, hot, etc.

- In the appbar we've added the ability to favorite subreddits, hide and save posts.

- We've made changes to the pinned subreddit tiles so that the names of subreddits are more legible. 

- Share content from /r/etro to other applications (the old version could only share things TO /r/etro)

- Tons of other smaller fixes. Including small UX changes that nobody should explicitly notice (unless you REALLY look) but should make the app feel better.

To those of you that have already tried /r/etro, thanks, and if you haven't now's a good time to start. Our next release will be version 2, and will come with all the big features a whole number increment warrants. Some of the basic things we're adding are stuff like user pages, messaging, search, a light theme, etc. But we're most excited about a couple super cool features we're not ready to discuss yet.

Again, thanks to you all, and we hope you enjoy the most recent release!

1354126768.0	13y0va	My thoughts after several weeks exclusively in Windows 8	NoShftShck16	25	6	23	"So I am falling head over heels in love with Windows 8. My (awesome) sister gave me her old laptop and I threw Windows 8 on it. It auto synced all my settings and I redownloaded all my apps/programs so it is a mini version of my desktop but with only the stuff I need for work. I have been using Windows 8 exclusively for work and I have not run into a single issue. I use the app versions of stuff when working casually (eg. replying to emails, basic browsing) and use the desktop version when I need to do more (eg. organizing inbox, web development).

Obviously I still love Android, but after buying the TF101 for ""productivity"" I quickly found how awful Android is to get anything done. I sold it and picked up the Nexus 7 to compliment my Galaxy Nexus. It is great for what I really use a tablet for: media consumption, web browsing, games, etc.

Now having this laptop is great, however the battery is dead, its not a great one to begin with and it seems like it is almost more than I need for a portable productivity machine.

Enter: Surface Pro. This is certainly my next gadget, I will be able to dump Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver on it as well as Sublime and all the major browsers I use for testing. I will have the full Office suite and also have something very small that I could bring into the office (I work remotely) that can be quickly plugged into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. In addition, when I go back to school, I would LOVE the ability to record every lecture while taking notes.

With this being said, I do want to try Windows Phone. I could never commit fully simply because I can very easily name 10 things/apps I can't do/use on anything but Android. When I move off Verizon, I will certainly do my best to give it a shot.

Xbox music seems to snap reflexively back to getting music from the internet, even under the ""my music"" heading. Because it likes to pair HDD music with its xbox music counterpart, it will often override your selections.

For example, I have the 20-track uncensored ""Truth About Love"" album by P!nk. If I go to ""my music"" or use the search charm, it brings up album information and will play a truncated version of the album. Presumably, because that version of the album isn't on Xbox Music. So I'm missing more than a few tracks from the album that's actually on my HDD.

As well, if I'm not careful, it will double up on songs where multiple versions exist (""clean"", ""parental advisory"", etc.).

The dashboard for it seems to lack customizability. I can't filter out ad-supported free music from smart-DJ collections, and I can't pin my own stuff to ""my music"".

And this last part is minor, but it drives me nuts: playing my stuff forcefully via ""open file"" (or using file explorer in the first place) does not have the artist-related visualizations, just the generic colors and geometric shapes.

It also doesn't let you really manage your library via metadata editing or putting in your own album art.

Multimedia 8 seems like a good app to start to assuage some of these issues, but the Zune software is still so, so much better than Xbox music. It lets me filter unwanted stuff, it gives me visualizations of my other-sourced music, it lets me edit metadata.

Am I missing something, or did they cut Zune off at the knees with Xbox Music?"	t5_2s692	True

1374336880.0	1ip7j6	Who actually complained about the Search charm?	a-ko	26	11	37	"From anyone who has actually, honestly used Windows 8, and doesn't gripe about it over and over--who has honestly griped about the Search Charm?

In Windows 8, the Search Charm is the 'primary' search mechanism used across the system. It's contextually-aware, meaning it functions slightly differently in different situations of use.

If you're on the Tile Screen, the Search Charm defaults to searching your apps and settings (control panel). If you're within an application (say, the Windows Store), the Search Charm defaults to searching within the app itself.

However, in all of these situations, you can choose different apps to search through, and switch the context of the search manually if you so desire.

With the move to Windows 8.1, they've completely removed this contextual search system from Windows 8. Instead, the Search Charm is now a dedicated, limited, and focused search. It still searches your apps and settings (why would they rip that out?), but it now ALSO includes online searching.

The problem with the online searching is that it is a dedicated search app for online tablet use. It's kind of a mini browser, so to speak, optimized for touch experience, ripping out all of the 'fluff' of HTML/JS on webpages and presenting results to you in a tablet-style manner.

The Search App functionality (where I assume they pulled this from) actually exists in Windows Phone, and I'm just not a huge fan of it.

Sure, you can now search the web right from the Search Charm. Yay, good for it. But why couldn't they have made this an ADDITION to the Search function provided by the existing Charm? i.e. make it context-based.

They've gone out of their way to now include dedicated search boxes in each application to bring back the App-specific search.

I thought I was going to like the Search changes in 8.1, and I thought their plans for it, based off of my usage on Windows 8, was going to really bring the Search Charm to awesomeness. Instead, I absolutely can't stand the change they made."	t5_2s692	True

I've eliminated RT devices, machines with 1366x768 resolution (that's what I have on the Netbook now), 2 GB RAM machines (I upped the netbook to 4) and Atom Processors.

Basically that boils it down to 3 gadgets... Surface Pro, Asus Transformer Book and the Acer W700. All three of which have their own pros and cons.

The Surface Pro has an issue with the SSD being chewed up with un-necessary crap. No biggie, I can clean that up. I hear it also has a weak battery, something easily fixed by having a charger/dock at work.

The Acer W700 doesn't support a MicroSD slot, otherwise just as good, if not better than the Surface Pro. Not being able to add my own memory is kind of a deal breaker.

Asus Transformer Book seems pretty hot, but for $500 more than the Surface, it better be. Optional i7, keyboard has it's own 500GB hard drive. MicroSD in the tablet, standard SD in the keyboard. Better battery. Oh, and it's not quite out yet.

It's looking like the Transformer is going to be the way to go, unless there's some other machine out there I'm not aware of or I'm missing something.

I've been using Play to on windows8 with the standard definition mp4 files and it works flawlessly. I started looking around and never found a way to convert MKV to MP4 without it being a huge pain in the ass. MKV and MP4 use the same x264 compression so you don't need to transcode in reality so it isn't as crazy as it seems to convert without loosing quality. The audio is the thing that needs conversion (AC3 or DTS to AAC) so this is really a lot less work than every video converter makes it. I found this guys page that describes how to do it.

This seems really complicated but it isn't because I will post the batch files I updated for DTS and AC3. Just edit the batch file and paste in the following and save as a different name to keep track of which audio type. Here is the batch file for AC3 audio:


@ ECHO OFF

IF EXIST *.mkv FOR %%A IN (*.mkv) DO CALL :mkvConvert ""%%A""

Now he talks about how to check the audio format on the mkv you want to convert. I recommend using mkvetractgui because it is the gui version of the tool not the command line interface and you can see all the relevant info.

1351749390.0	12g1zf	Bitlocker and SSD		17	2	5	"I figure I might as well take advantage of the Pro features and use Bitlocker. I elected not to use TrueCrypt on it because the TC developers recommend you not doing so and I hear you take a pretty big performance hit and TRIM/wear leveling functionality is pretty questionable.

Windows 8 seems to have taken into account the increasing popularity of SSDs. I have a Samsung 830 and used the Magician software it comes with to optimize the drive. One of the OS optimization things it recommends is to disable defrag. When checking out my HDDs I discovered that Windows 8 doesn't defrag the SSD but will optimize it and do some kind of trim function.

Since Bitlocker is offered, I figure that MS would be smart enough to have the two play together well and that wearing would no longer be an issue. 

So has anyone implemented bitlocker on their OS drive on an SSD and what kind of performance hits did you see. I know that sandforce controllers don't work well with encryption as they can't compress on the fly but Samsung performs at the same level regardless. 

I think that the performance hit shouldn't affect me. I am using an older Core 2 Duo laptop without hardware AES. Sony's bios lock prevents me from enabling AHCI and my computer only supports SATA1 and looking at my transfer rates, I'm thinking my bottleneck is SATA and not the cpu. 

I would love to hear anyones experience with this. Encryption doesn't seem to be a high priority with most people and most of my google search results are for Windows 7 or for regular SSDs.

Before anyone recommend I just use Truecrypt, I would prefer to use Bitlocker as it seems better integrated with external drives and is more invisible and seamless with how I work. 

My concern is not corporate espionage or having drives full of kiddie porn because I have nothing of the sort so I don't really need a twofish-aes combo encryption with file keys. I just realize if someone where to rob my place, the most obvious thing of value would be my portable hard drives and laptop. Not having a thief judge me on my taste of porn is also a plus.

Pros

 *  Metro UI - Some hates it, but I think most will love it.  It could be improved but it is definitely a good start.
 *  Hyper-V - I had to choose win2008 R2 over win 7 because of Hyper V.  But no more!
 *  Native ISO mounting - Finally!
 *  Excellent Multi-monitor support - multi picture backgrounds &amp; themes are very nice.
 *  Boot in 7 seconds - after bios, comparing to about 30 seconds on R2.
 *  App store - like it or not, it is coming.  As a developer, I think it is a great place to be.  However I do wish wish the app store can publish none metro app as well.
 *  New file explorer - New ribbon interface is more efficient than old school menus.

Con

 *  Multi monitor support for Metro Apps - Metro Apps only lives on one monitor.
 *  Better keyboard support for the new Start menu - When right click on an metro app, we have to move the mouse all the way to the bottom to click.  Why not create mnemonic for the commands.  Even number keys could be pretty good.

On a side note, IE 10 seems to run well.  I haven't had the urge to install chrome yet.

I know Windows 8.1 is supposed to include a lot of improvements which is great. No doubt, Microsoft will continue to make improvements based on customer feedback.

It seems Microsoft still isn't budging on bring back the Start Menu. And I can understand why given the direction they want to go in. (not saying I agree with it, but I think it could be handled better) However, I can't help that there are two things they could do that would help tremendously.

1. A lot of people don't mention it directly, but part of the problem that has been created with the introduction of ""metro"" apps is that they are full screen. If you are working on multiple things, it makes multi-tasking harder (even with the Windows snap feature). There are already tools out there one can buy to make ""metro"" apps into resizable Windows. Why doesn't Microsoft implement this in their OS? After all the OS is called ""Windows"". Applications should be resizable, moveable, or full screen.

2. In 8.1, they are introducing the ability to use the same desktop wallpaper as the start screen background. I think this is a great step towards some familiarity with the desktop. But I think it would be even better if they took it a step forward and simply added some transparency much like the Launch Pad has in OS X. The transparency in the Start Screen would only be there when there are active windows in the desktop. It wouldn't be so jarring to switch between the start screen and desktop mode at that point. I can't help but wonder why Microsoft didn't take this extra step.

What are some improvements that you wish to see in Windows 8.1?

1364318692.0	1b1w30	For any dev's out there having trouble creating app packages for the store due to a network timeout, I found a solution!	mrspanky12	17	3	1	"(Sorry if this is not the correct sub, i did not see a windows 8 dev specific sub)


Ok, so someone else submitted a ticket a yesterday [here](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/782015/visual-studio-express-for-windows-8-could-not-able-to-create-app-packages#) about this issue and I submitted a workaround for it, but due to formatting, it is very difficult to read. Here's the workaround:


Here's how I got it to work (tested on an has worked for 3 apps so far): 


1. In your package.appmanifest, under to 'Packaging' tab, put for 'package display name' the app name that's associated with the store (includes spaces, if any). 


2. Then, click 'choose certificate' and under 'configure certificate' click 'create test certificate'. 


3. For 'publisher common name', put your developer id (the part after 'CN=') and leave the password fields blank and click 'ok', and then 'ok' again. 


4. Then create an app package, but do not associate it with the store. (It is recommended you run the automated test program as well if you haven't already) 


5. Then, try to upload the package to the store. (It will give you an error that the package name is wrong or doesn't match, that's what we want for now.) 
(If your are doing this for multiple apps, the correct package name should be a few numbers followed by your developer name followed by a period and the app name associated with the store. The part before the period does not change, so you can save that for future use and skip from step 4 to step 7.) 


6. Copy the correct package name (given in the error). 


7. Go back to your package.appmanifest, under the 'Packaging' tab and paste the correct package name into the 'Package name' field. 


8. Now that the manifest is correct, make another app package (again, without associating it with the store), and upload that package to the store. 


9. That's it! 


(Basically, we must change the app manifest to match the store release manually instead of having it done for us automatically.)

I work for a company who develops web-based software that requires add-ins to be installed for the browser. If a Win8 user opens our site in the metro IE browser, they are given a message that they require add-ins and should re-open it in desktop mode. I know the user can change the Internet Options setting on their machine to always open links/tiles in desktop mode, but we can't always expect our users to do that, or know how. 

So my question... Is it possible to somehow, via HTML or otherwise, make it so that any time someone hits our site, it always opens in desktop mode, even if they were starting from the metro IE app? Basically, is there a way to make the switch to desktop IE for them?

We really don't want to have to tell our users ""yeah, you have to change this internet setting on your side so that it always opens in desktop IE"" unless it's the only choice. I'm really hoping there's something we can do on our side so our users don't have to make the extra step."	t5_2s692	True

It means when you're commenting on a post you can select which account you want to comment as just by selected the name from a drop down.

For all other features (upvote/downvote, etc.) you'll be using whichever account is currently selected.  To change this account just go to the main view (click on the username in the top right corner) and you'll see your profile on the left.  

In your profile details, the username is a dropdown (when more then one account is setup) and you just change the selected user from there.

Recently I've noticed that every time I try to install a program on Windows 8 nothing happens. The installer starts loading and then nothing at all happens. I can't figure out what was wrong. Running as Administrator doesn't help. Disabling UAC hasn't helped. Turning on the older .NET framework hasn't helped. Nothing. 

This problem only seems to happen when I use programs downloaded from the internet, .iso's and things which I can go into to manually select the setup file still seem to work fine.

1358732232.0	16ymwi	Confirmed Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit via Boot Camp on Apple Mac mini MD388X, how-to, Home media server solution	oscarvtm	15	1	13	"I was unsure for the last few weeks whether Windows 8 would work via Boot Camp on an Apple Mac mini. It is common knowledge that Apple haven't released official support for Windows 8 on their hardware via Boot Camp but there are many reports that it works, albeit sometimes good, sometimes great, many times problematic.

I haven't done anything extraordinary, and I have only consolidated advice I myself have learned from blogs, forums and websites. The main reason for this post it to add a positive story of a Windows 8 installation on an Apple Mac mini as I couldn't find any discussions online for this device, it was either MacBook Pro or MacBook Air.

I chose this hardware/software solution as it suits my needs well. I wanted a computer to primarily consolidate/hold and share an iTunes library, tv shows and home movies with other devices we have in the family, as well as some minor web/cloud hosting requirements outside of the scope of this thread.

Many of the applications I recommend below are available for OSX and Windows however I just can't live without Windows Explorer for file management. This is my first experience with Windows 8, I am a business user of Windows 7 and am comfortable with OSX. As I become more familiar with Windows 8 I may lose some of the legacy Windows 7 features I have enabled (or not). I intend to use Office 2013 when released. 


Please comment with any further questions.



In this brief guide I will discuss the following in order:

* operating system
* hardware
* screenshots
* applications/utilities/drivers
* setting default applications in Windows 8
* The Sims 3
* desktop shortcuts
* keyboard shortcuts
* Enable show desktop



**operating system**

A retail DVD* copy of Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit described as ""WINDOWS 8 PRO ENG INTL FOR OEM SOFTWARE""
*call me useless but I used a Apple USB SuperDrive during installation rather than a USB bootable ISO - The are many guides online as to how to achieve this installation without an optical drive.

I also activated* an official free copy of Windows Media Center available here (for a limited time): http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/feature-packs

*note: If you have trouble activating Windows online from the Metro UI use the Activate mode from the Desktop Control Panel. There is a bug with internet connectivity if not established during the initial Windows 8 installation.

*note: as I use the Keyboard+Trackpad on my lap from the comfort of my sofa I have enabled the tap-to-click option in the Boot Camp Control Panel accessible form the Windows 8 Control Panel
I'm not big on gestures, but I can confirm click (single finger tap), double-click (two finger tap) and scroll (two finger drag) function correctly.

**setting default applications in Windows 8 (i.e. VLC Media Player and Chrome)**

Windows 8 trys to maintain file associations with some of it's metro apps, this can be resolved by setting the default applications in the Control Panel using Programs, Default Programs.



**--for the kids/The Sims 3 (EA Origin digital edition)**

Compatibility has been getting a bit of attention online so I'll throw it in here:
Install/Update Origin, Download/Install The Sims 3 base game, Download/Install the Cumulative Base Game 1.47.6 Super Patcher for The Sims 3 (1.1GB): http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/175477.page
Play



**desktop shortcuts**

I personally needed to slowly migrate myself away from the natural Start button reaction to I created a few desktop shortcuts for some common Start button requests. I placed these in the lower left corner of my desktop.

* ""Start"" desktop folder to hold application shortcuts
* Windows Explorer shortcut	target: ""C:\Windows\explorer.exe""
* Control Panel shortcut	(Drag Control folder from Windows Explorer onto the desktop to create this shortcut)
* Run shortcut	target: ""%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{2559a1f3-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}""
* Command Prompt shortcut	target: ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""



**keyboard shortcuts**

The key to managing the Windows 8 UI and mitigating the absence of the Start button on the taskbar is keyboard shortcuts, here are some essentials:
For complete set of Windows 8 keyboard shortcuts visit: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/keyboard-shortcuts

**Windows logo key (or Apple command key)** 			Display or hide the Start screen
Hitting the Windows key on its own brings up the Metro desktop. However, if you then start typing Windows will begin searching (just as it used to on the old Start menu), finding apps, files and settings. You can also switch to searching other Metro apps from within the interface. You can navigate the results with the arrow keys and Enter, so you donât need to use a mouse at all.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +C**		Open the charms
Think of charms as a kind of super-sized options setting: you can use individual charms to share with other apps, search for information, change settings, or send something to a connected device such as a printer or drive.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +D**		Display and hide the desktop
If youâre not using Metro apps and want a more familiar Windows interface, Windows-D opens up the desktop.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +R**		Open the Run dialog box
Opens Run menu where you can launch programs by typing in their executable file names.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +F**		Open the Search charm and search for files
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +I**		Open the Settings charm
This is a speedy route to system-wide PC settings. Itâs also where youâll find the Power button if you want to shut down your machine entirely (by default, Windows 8 favours putting your system to sleep rather than a complete shutdown.)
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +Tab**		Cycle through open apps (except desktop apps)



**Enable show desktop (Peek)**

Aero Peek featured is disabled by default in Windows 8. Right-click on the taskbar and then click Properties to open Taskbar Properties. Under Taskbar tab, tick Use Peek to preview the desktop when you move your mouse to the Show Desktop button at the end of the taskbar checkbox to enable the feature.

1357901128.0	16dgw5	Any coders feel an urge to seek the lower-levels?	WirtThePegLeggedBoy	20	7	17	So Windows 8 is my leap into the current generation, and I'm loving it. I must admit, as a hobbyist programmer (games, utilities, just little things I like to code to round out my computer usage) I'm still getting the hang of .NET in general after years and years spent coding with COM in plain old Win32 (Don't like Java, typically I code in C/C++, and I have a special place in my heart for VB6.)  I'm curious to see what programmers have to say about managed code, C++/CLI, and generally how they feel about the architecture of Windows 7/8.  I mean, sure, these new languages are quick and easy, but I can't help but feel that all that abstraction, though miniscule, is wasteful nonetheless, and computers and processing power is at an all time high these days yet we aren't really harnessing it's full potential.

1357846990.0	16bx1f	Is Windows RT on the Surface Enough To Use At Work??	eyevandrago	14	3	21	I am looking at the Surface with RT but I'm a little worried that I'll be able to use it in the work place. I do television production and my job requires very light computing. I basically need it for Word Processing, Email, and Web Browsing. I'm sure the Surface will handle all those tasks fine. My main concern is Windows RT compatibility with printers. I work freelance so I am in various different offices throughout the years. Most people I work with have MacBooks or MacBook Pros (mine is on its last leg) and Apple has pretty easy printer setup options. I'm worried with the Surface I won't be able to connect to certain printers because they don't make drivers fo RT. Anyone have any experience with this?

1353330027.0	13g5mv	Has anyone else noticed a somewhat severe performance hit when playing games under Windows 8?	DamienCIsDead	18	5	31	"My current machine was built this past summer, primarily for gaming. Up until recently I had been running Windows 7 Pro and all my games ran just fine. I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro, mostly for the under-the-hood improvements. I don't even use the Start screen at all.

I started noticing that most of my games are running very badly. Where before I got 50-60fps in most of my games (at 1920x1080 with most settings cranked and 4xAA/16xAF), now most of them are down to between 30-40fps, occasionally dipping down to the 20s. Disabling VSync tends to help the framerate slightly, but I still don't break the mid 40s for fps and then I have to deal with screen tearing.

Games affected: Fallout 3 GOTY, Call of Duty 4, MW3, Battlefield 3, XCOM:EU, Diablo III, etc. (Pretty much everything)

Specs:

AMD FX-4100

ASRock 970 Extreme 4 BIOS 2.20

8gb DDR3-1600

60gb boot SSD, 500gb storage HD

MSI Twin Frozr III Radeon 7850 2gb (tried Catalyst 12.8, 12.11 Beta 8, and 12.10 Official drivers)

I spent all Sunday searching forums and doing Google searches and couldn't find much, besides a few random people who have similar issues with one or two games. Nobody could provide any answers besides ""Windows 8 is your problem it sucks lol.""

I've tried updating my Catalyst drivers (doing a driver sweep in between each change) and that hasn't helped at all. I'd rather not reformat and reinstall 7 right now, especially since most of my games are through Steam and that will mean several days worth of downloading. At the moment though I'm resigned to this being a Windows 8 specific issue that won't get resolved anytime soon.

Anyone have any similar experiences?

**EDIT:** It was definitely Windows 8, I got fed up and reformatted and put 7 back on, and everything works fine. Not sure if it was a driver issue, but I'm going to wait a while before I switch back.

1351522727.0	129zmf	What is the best laptop/desktop/tablet/slate replacement?	miguelos	19	5	30	"Windows 8 is an hybrid OS for an hybrid device. It only really makes sense on hybrid devices that can be used both as a desktop/laptop, and a tablet/slate. With Windows 8 on my desktop/laptop, I feel like the whole Metro/Modern UI is wasted, as I almost never use it. I don't see why I should use and customize the Metro/Modern interface on my computer unless I can use it as a tablet/slate. Sure, I could get both a Windows RT tablet/slate and a Windows 8 desktop/laptop, but I feel like the Metro/Modern interface would be redundant. If people had to own both a Windows 8 laptop/desktop and a Windows RT tablet/slate, it would make much more sense to make 2 distinct OSes, kind of like Mac OS X and iOS. Because both interfaces exist in Windows 8, I feel like not using an hybrid device would be wasted potential. In my opinion, Windows RT only makes sense for people who don't need any of the x86 features.

With that said, I believe that Windows 8 is a great opportunity to cut down the number of device I own, by replacing both my Desktop and iPad by a single Windows 8 hybrid device. I understand that some compromises will be made (heavier and less battery life than a tablet, weaker and with a smaller screen than a laptop/desktop), but I feel like they're worth it if it allows me to have only one device to carry/worry about.

I'm not planning on using it for heavy gaming, and the only reason I really need x86 support is because it's going to be my main machine, and I need to develop on it (Visual Studio, etc). Spec-wise, all I need is an Ultrabook. Intel Ivy Bridge Core i5, 4GM RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000 and 128 GB SSD. The device also needs docking options, because I will use it with 2 external displays, an external keyboard and an external mouse. However, I believe that some USB 3.0 docking systems exist.

Here is a list of some Windows 8 hybrid/convertible ""Ultrabook"" devices I found:

- [Microsoft Surface Pro](http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-8-pro/home)

- [Samsung Ativ Smart PC Pro](http://www.samsung.com/global/ativ/ativ_pc_pro.html)

- [MSI Slider S20](http://www.msi.com/news-media/news/1435.html)

What do you guys think is the best Windows 8 hybrid/convertible ""Ultrabook"" device? Do you believe it's powerful enough to replace a main desktop/laptop? Do you think it's slim, light and has enough battery life to be used as a comfortable tablet/slate? Do you believe that there's no such device and that I should accept the reality of owning a proper desktop/laptop and a proper tablet/slate? I'm looking forward for your answers.

* Internet Explorer 10 is really good. But I'll go with Chrome for now, since I can't drop the bookmarks synchronization features.
* I have a Microsoft Touch Mouse and the gestures are really different from the Windows 7 ones. They are obviously more Windows 8 oriented and they appear to be really useful.
* I love the pause feature in files copying/deletion.
* I love the disappearing of the confirmation dialog when pressing DEL with a file selected.
* I keep pressing Windows + D to go fast on the desktop... I think it's something I'll need to get used to.
* I enjoy the Mail app and the Google integration with Gmail and Calendar.
* The App Store is not great yet. Most killer desktop apps are missing.

* I can no longer use the start menu's search to find/launch folders. In windows 7, I could hit start, type the name of any folder in an indexed path, hit enter, and be there. In windows 8, this doesn't seem possible at all. 

* This one's minor, but the ribbon UI on explorer windows has broken my decades-old keyboard shortcuts. For example, to view in list, I'd hit alt-v for view menu, l for list. or v,d for details, v,x for e(x)tra large icons, etc. Is there any way to either get menus back, or are there keyboard shortcuts for these view types?

I have a Nokia Lumia 900, so I was a big fan of the Metro interface and decided to take the plunge.  I'm mostly happy, now that I've figured out the basics of using the new OS.

However, there are a few things that are bugging me.  I find that when I try to get work done, I get distracted by something small and it ends up taking an hour to figure it out.  First, there was the problem of integrating Xbox Music with my Zune collection.  I have used Zune for years and am a current subscriber to the Zunepass, so I have a decent collection built up.  At first, it took me a while to figure out how to get my Xbox Music to import the Zune pass songs from Zune.  Got that taken care of, then went to play some music and it gave me a DRM error message.  The thing is, it only gives me that message for some songs.  Even other songs on the same album will play.  Eventually I gave up on that and just went back to using Zune.

Then, as I was working on a document, I decided I wanted to listen to Pandora.  So I searched out an app in the store and tried to install it.  The app hung in download/installation forever, did not ever actually download or install.  I tried to cancel the installation; the operation hung and it just sat there without changing.  I closed the store by dragging it down to the bottom of the screen, re-opened it, and it was still doing the same thing.  Eventually, about 15 minutes later, I was able to cancel the installation.  Like I said, small things distracting me from being productive.

Also, in Xbox Music, it told me there were two songs downloading.  However, I could not figure out what it was downloading.  It just would not tell me and I couldn't find anything to manage downloads.  Is there anything like a download center to see my downloads and manage them?  

I'm frustrated because I feel like I have less control over my computer than I did in Win7, and these small things keep piling up and keeping me from getting my work done."	t5_2s692	True

If you've already downloaded Narwhal, you should get an update notification on your Store tile.  If you haven't downloaded it, yet, you can do so [here](http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/narwhal/7fbb57a5-360c-4fcb-b6f1-a6c6c3aac9f8).

This release introduces the Explorer Bar.  This bar lists the top 25 popular subreddits, and all of your subscribed subreddits (as long as you are logged in).  You can enable/disable the explorer bar by flipping a switch on the appbar.  Your choice will be remembered for you.

A few other changes for this release:

* Improved performance:  Performance has been significantly improved across the board.  Comments are no longer painful to review.
* Mousewheel scrolling!  Comments and posts can now be scrolled with the mousewheel.  Huzzah!
* Fixed a crash bug that was affecting self-text posts that were empty.
* Changed downvote color to blue.
* Default NSFW Filter to High:  First time users will note that NSFW content is masked.  This can be changed by going to the settings charm, and changing your preferences as appropriate.
* Quick Account Access:  Login or change account by tapping the user information in the upper right of the screen.
* Reduced the number of stories on the start page to six per category.  The old number was 9 per category, which had some performance implications.  

*edit: forgot to mention...*  
Narwhal should now be available in many, many more markets, and it now will install on the Acer Iconia W500.  
*end edit*

I've also started work on release 3.  A couple items that are under development for the next release (and beyond):

* Submit a link (or picture, or self-text).
* Additional changes to the ""Load More"" button UI.  Yes... it looks like ass, but for now it works.
* Navigation changes in the comment view to handle the back button in a more logical manner when you have expanded content.
* Better navigation from the start page into content (self-text items will go directly to comments, other items will go directly to content).
* PMs and User Info."	t5_2s692	True

NotYourLoginID	17	6	14	"So I bought a new Windows 8 Laptop and I love it, though today at work a colleague of mine accidentally saved over a file they had just edited with their original. They then had to go and take 4 hours to re-edit their document. I imagined myself having the same issue one day and I came up with this solution that I'd like your guys opinion on:

* Buy a 16GB SD card and leave it in the SD card reader of my laptop since I never use the reader. (It would become part of the computer for all intensive purposes.)
* Enable Windows 8 *File History* feature and select the SD card as the backup device
* Allow *File History* to use most of the drive(Possibly: give whatever space remains to ReadyBoost? Though my computer is a relative powerhouse, is this just a redundant feature that I'd get no benefit from?)
* Set *File History* Settings to *Keep Saved Versions Until Space Is Needed* to make things dynamic?
* Make an Hourly/2-hour backup so that the drive is not overwhelmed
* Never worry about deleting a file/overwriting a file again?

This is particularly annoying since I connect to the internet via a WiFi dongle. I can plug in a wired keyboard and mouse, but I can't just drag an ethernet cable across the house.

The problem shows up primarily when the system has been running for a while, and has been running fairly resource-intensive processes (HD video playback, games, and what-have-you).

1373591084.0	1i4exa	Windows 8 frequently tells me I'm running out of memory, sometimes with app crashes. But according to Task Manager, there's always at least 2GB of memory available. What's going on?	scootey	14	2	8	"I've got Windows 8 on a system with 8GB of physical memory; it's the 64-bit version of course. Recently I started using this system a lot more frequently, as I use a laptop (MacBook with OS X) as my primary computer.

I use Google Chrome for web browsing, and my browsing habits will sometimes result in having a few dozen tabs open at once. This uses a good amount of memory of course, and in Chrome creates lots of processes (one for each tab). I've never had a problem on OS X...but on Windows 8, I am regularly getting ""low on memory"" warnings. Sometimes individual tabs or the entire browser will crash as a result.

What's strange is that I've been monitoring memory usage in Task Manager, and I have not been seeing memory usage exceed 6GB. (So that makes 2GB+ of free physical memory.) It appears memory usage is right at the 6GB point when the OS thinks it's running out of memory.

I'm thinking it may have something to do with the fact that I only have a 1GB pagefile. As I understand, it's somewhat on the low side, but supposedly it's feasible if you have a decent amount of memory. Would increasing the pagefile size likely alleviate my problems?

Even if it does, here's my question: why is Windows claiming it's out of memory (and crashing programs) when there are supposedly ~2GB available? *Why doesn't it use that memory?* I don't have integrated graphics or anything that might be reserving RAM; possibly something I'm unaware of? Is Task Manager bullshitting about how much memory is available? Possible bug? Chrome's fault?

Or as mentioned, maybe it's Windows' paging system? I have some understanding of the concept of virtual memory, but why wouldn't it just use the free 2GB in physical memory? (I'm glad to listen in whatever level of detail you'd like to describe, if this is the case.) Like you have people talking about putting a pagefile on a ramdisk. (Yo dawg, I heard you like memory so I put memory in your memory...fine i'll stop)

NightO_Owl	13	3	6	"I had an old Acer machine with Vista on it collecting dust, so I thought I'd install Windows 8 on it and make use of it somehow. I installed Windows 8 32-bit on it, and it worked fine for several months, up until about a month ago when I had several windows updates to do. I really only used the machine as a second screen next to my new main monitor for looking up strategies/wikis for games as I was playing, so it wasn't really on *all* the time.

During the process of installing the updates, at one point, the screen went black for several seconds then came back on, which I thought nothing of because I've seen this happen occasionally with certain windows updates, so I thought it was no biggie. Upon restarting my machine, and coming back to the login screen, I noticed the resolution had changed. Once again, I thought, no biggie, I'll just change that under screen resolution. When I attempted to do so, the native resolution of my monitor (1440x900) was no longer there like it had been all those years before. I tried creating a custom resolution under the Nvidia control panel but that only made it look worse. I tried doing a system restore to the earliest possible date and still no option to select the correct resolution. I also double checked to see if the drivers were up to date on both my video card and monitor, and they were. I even tried rolling back the drivers to see if that would help, but no luck.

Recently, I did a clean install of Ubuntu on that machine because I'm trying to learn Linux on the side, and was hoping maybe it would fix the issue. Well, it didn't and trying to figure out that kind of advanced issue on an operating system I barely know, was just too much for me. So last night, I re-installed Windows 8 again, this time 64-bit, since I found out my CPU on that machine, is a x64-based processor and now I'm going to try and see if I can fix this issue in Windows. It was also a clean install of Win8 since I had to reformat the hard drive due to Ubuntu formatting the HD to FAT32. I also went into the BIOS to look for any resolution related things that may have been changed and couldn't find anything, so I just reset to the default settings hoping that would have done something but still no luck.

My system specs are:

Windows 8 Pro

CPU: AMD Athlon 64 Proccesor 3800+ 2.40 GHz

RAM: 3GB

Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT

In the first chart, you can see what my daily download/upload was, It sat at an average of around 800MB per day. Then on the first day of the new billing period, I installed Windows 8, hence the spike. However, from that point onwards, my downloads went through the roof, going up to an average of around 1.5GB per day and currently for this month the average is at around 2GB per day. If I use more than 1GB today, my connection will get shaped, though thankfully the new billing period starts at midnight tonight.

My question is why on earth has my usage gone up so much? My computer habits have not really changed since I installed Windows 8. I still use the internet just as much as I always did, I don't watch many videos or listen to music and I often spend time playing offline games. Over the last week or so I have also been watching DVDs when I would otherwise have been browsing the net and yet the downloads are still high. Yesterday I was at work from 8-4 (my wife was at home but only really used the net for Facebook) and I used the internet for a few hours and then watched a few DVDs. Yet it is still saying that I've downloaded 2GB! Prior to installing Windows 8, a day like yesterday would have totalled about 500MB of downloads.

What is going on here? I've tried changing the router password for wifi in case of line hacking, I've disabled Windows automatic updates and other program updates, I've disabled live tiles, yet it is still giving me ridiculously high results for usage.

It worked for a couple months (skype for desktop) so i deleted the default skype for windows 8. and now it won't work. it's just the screen with the clouds with the skype logo on it. I tried several solutions, most of them involved allowing javascript on IE, but that didn't help. a couple things in the run menu didn't work either. i tried to redownload skype for windows 8, but apparently windows apps are broken too. I have no idea whether or not the problems are related or not, and I have no clue what to do. any help is appreciated.	t5_2s692	True

1. How much battery am I draining by letting apps run in the background? If you close out of apps, they're super slow to start up again. So I've just been using the classic desktop screen for this reason. 
2. I installed Chrome, because that's what I've used for a long time. But what's annoying about that is that when I open it up, it goes back to classic desktop. I'd like to stick with one screen or the other and avoid this. Is there an app for Firefox or chrome that will allow me to stay on the main screen? But i also I like that IE is full screen when using the app. Should I try giving IE a shot for a while?
3. I gather that a lot of people use the hibernate function instead of shut down for faster start-up with Win8. Are there long term effects to doing this that will be bad for my computer?

Other than this, I think the new OS is pretty cool and I'm learning a lot of neat functions. Any other cool tips are welcome and appreciated. "	t5_2s692	True

The fee i was talking about would be in 20$ - 50$ range, and would be kind of a donation based (you send us the request, we finish the app, and if you are satisfied you donate some money, if you are not you dont have to).

The example of the process would be: You visit a website on daily basis and would love to see a windows 8 app that would add some features that you think the website itself lacks. You send us a request and design(optional), we tell you we accepted the offer and give you a estimated time of release, we make an app, put it on windows store, and if you like what you see, you donate some money to us.

1366037440.0	1ce3ny	Surface Pro or Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro?	pnewman98	12	1	8	"I'm looking to pick up a new computer either this spring or summer before I start grad school in the fall, and at this point I think I'm between the Surface Pro or the ATIV Smart PC Pro.  I have a 3 year old MacBook Pro that I still plan to use for most of my heavy writing, but I'm also going to try to keep that at home for the most part so it doesn't go through the wear of getting lugged around and so that I'm not carrying that heavy a computer around.  

I'm a Political Science student which means I'll need to be able to run STATA and R and some other statistical programs relatively easily, and I was hoping to have a more portable device that could handle those tasks, which is why I've been looking primarily at the i5 devices.  Would an Atom computer be able to do these sorts of things in a pinch? That would definitely make the budget situation more palatable, but at this point unless I get some indication otherwise I'm looking towards the Pro devices.

The Surface Pro seems to be a great device, but I'm concerned partly about storage for the pen, which I'll be using almost constantly for note-taking and other tasks.  I also am not sure how good it is for use not on a table or desk, as it's so dependent on the kick-stand for balance.  I tend to use my current computer a lot on my lap or in other non-standard positions for writing, but it seems like the Surface is somewhat limited for that.  

Meanwhile, the ATIV Smart Pro seems to have the same internals but with a larger, slightly lower quality display and a keyboard dock (no extra battery) and overall a bit lower build quality in terms of solidness.    What I like about it is the ability to use it in both tablet mode and laptop mode, so I can prop the display at whatever angle I like when typing. I'd also be able to essentially have dock setups at home and at work by picking up and extra keyboard and power brick.  

Basically, what I'm trying to gauge is whether the increased usability of the Samsung Smart PC Pro is enough that I should choose it over the slightly more limited Surface Pro? Or should I be looking in a less premium direction altogether? Thanks"	t5_2s692	True

In Windows 7, I could add Coolbits and Coolbits64 entries to Nvidia registry files, set them to 18 and have them be able to run in SLI with little to no issues.

However, when I try to add these entries to Windows 8, I can get the Nvidia control panel to see them as SLI-able cards, but then when I actually set them to SLI mode, control panel will crash and then windows will no longer recognize my cards as an Nvidia card until I completely reinstall the drivers (and wipe out the coolbits entries).

Anyone have any experience with successfully enabling coolbits on Windows 8?

Thanks in advance!

edit: I should qualify this by saying that I believe that I am running the same driver version for what I came from in Windows 7 and now in Windows 8, but I could be wrong about that.

Wtf?	bitchesloveplazas	13	1	19	"I got my brand new computer (Toshiba Satellite P845t) a few weeks ago only to take it back a few days later. I was not initially excited for the windows 8 format, but I picked a laptop that has a touch screen so I thought it would be easier to use, and it has been.

Now, I'm not techie so I don't know if its just the model of my computer, but this is the SECOND brand new computer I've had in the last two weeks and I'm STILL getting glitches. I brought the last one back because of these glitches, like it wouldn't boot (just keyboard lights and fan running). When I choose the option ""don't require a password to get on computer,"" I still have to provide a password (this second computer too). Yesterday I got an error screen upon booting (second computer! same model) and right now my sound won't work for no apparent reason; my computer thinks its working just fine. 
Frequently are things taking a LONG time to load; not just impatient long time, but ""are you fucking kidding me this computer is brand new and this file isn't responding when i double click it."" in fact many things don't respond, including scrolling, moving things, all the basic functions are prone to take a little longer than a new computer should.

So what the hell? I don't know if I want someone to say that this is just the model of computer I have that's shitty, or that it's Windows 8, but over all I'm pretty pissed off I have to restart my 6 day old computer right now in order to get the sound working. 

If anyone has some sort of comfort, advice, solution, I would be delighted. (More than anything, I would love someone to tell me its that I'm handling my computer wrong and everything will be magically better if I do something different)

I got it to compare, and potentially replace, my Nexus 10. I figured that, for essentially the same price, I could get a similarly sized tablet that would be capable of a lot more, and so far I'm sort of right. Having the desktop available to run Spotify and some simple games on Steam is really nice. But I'm having a few problems, and I'm not sure if they're endemic to Windows 8, or just these types of Atom-powered tablets.

On the gaming side of things, I've tried installing and playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3 and 5. With 5, I have problems getting the start screen to load. Maybe 5 is too much for this tablet to handle? With 3, it works fine, but resizes itself so that it's only taking up a small portion of the screen. Will all full screen games do this? I guess I didn't quite think this whole thing through as far as games. While this thing could potentially play some games, very few of them are touch optimized. I'd have to get a keyboard/mouse, and at that point I might as well get a cheap ultrabook...

More frustratingly, I am having problems installing apps. I constantly get a message saying that my purchase can't be completed because my current internet connection is slow. Which it certainly isn't. I've tried restarting, disconnecting and reconnecting from the network, nothing seems to work.

I'll be connected to my home network (or any other network, for that matter) browsing the internet when suddenly my connection will be ""lost.""

Lets say, for example, I have three monitors connected to my computer. I want to watch hulu on the left one, read reddit on the center, and have skype on the right. 

In the old days, I could just have chrome w/ hulu on one, drag out a chrome tab on the main screen with reddit, and have my skype program on the right. 

Now, with the app system, if I open the hulu app and snap it to the left (win + pg up), I need to go back and launch the reddit app... but first i have to go back to the home thing... and oh wait that just got rid of hulu. Huh.

I can drag things and ""multitask"" but its only even on one screen. How do I get multiple apps open on multiple screens.

And yes, I realize I could just say fuck it and use the desktop mode. I'm trying to adopt this crap, and honestly some of the apps are really nice but for christs sake, why cant I watch hulu and read the internet at the same time on multiple monitors?"	t5_2s692	True

So with Modern UI, it seems we are forced into this strange 80/20 ratio where the 20 is all but useless. It seems as though display manufacturers are hell bent on making our monitors squat and wide. Since we've effectively gone from 16:12 (4:3) to 16:10 and now 16:9 (I really hope it stops here), vertical real estate is more precious than ever and I now have vast amounts of free space to the sides. 

So what is the rationale behind no 50/50 split for Modern UI? It had to have been a conscious decision on their part and to me, it really hurts productivity. It effectively nullifies any advantage a widescreen gives over the traditional 4:3 format and gives me all the disadvantages of it.

Basically click on a window -&gt; it turns red -&gt; click on desktop -&gt; it turns light red or pink.

2. Whatever happened to aero glass? The default window borders are completely opaque and are kinda ugly. Is there any way to restore the semi-transparent, hazy glass look while retaining the flat, sharp edges?

1375222489.0	1jdooe	Another example of Xbox Music being incomplete.	RocketMan63	16	7	8	"This is just short observation I found that it just annoying. Xbox Music was supposed to replace the Zune Software. Which I'm thinking is an incredibly difficult task since it's the best damn software I've ever used. However here's just a simple example.

I got a song from my friend that was for some reason missing from one of my favorite albums. So I copy it from him to the proper directory into the album's folder and everything. Here's Zune when it found the new file http://i.imgur.com/tTYviIX as you can see it does the obvious thing and uses the album are that's in the folder. Where as the music app in all it's horrible glory just leaves it blank http://imgur.com/idFYTux

Now I don't expect either do recognize the song because it strangely vanished from Microsoft's Marketplace. But I'd like to be able to put it in the right place. In Zune you just drag it to the album, it'll ask you if you want to combine them and it'll do the rest. In the music all you're pretty much fucked.

**EDIT:** Sigh, I must apologize to the Xbox Music Team. After a short while it appears that the Xbox Music App recognized the song placement and even moved it to the correct album without me having to do anything which is truly spectacular. Secondly, today I did the same thing as before with the exception that I added an entire album to the directory without any cover art. The Zune software picked up on this but did not recognize what artist it was by or give the appropriate album art or anything. Where as the Xbox Music App recognized the songs and the directory and was able to accurately assign the artist, album name, as well as provide the correct album art. In many ways the Xbox Music app exceeded the Zune Software. Even though I think the Xbox Music app does have many issues I will admit that this is not one of them."	t5_2s692	True

That being said, let's get to the good stuff.

**What's new?**

* A lot of performance updates. 
* Pretty much everything is tapable.  Tap on the subreddit logo to see the side bar, tap on your name to see your profile, tap on your link karma to see your links, tap on your comment karma to see your comments...I think you get the point
* A quick launch dropdown always in view.  From here you can go to any of your user links, any of your subscribed or casual subreddit. Or any of your groups. And it keeps the order that you set your subreddits in. (There is a known bug where some ads cover the dropdown from the main screen.  The fix is awaiting approval)
* Better tablet experience.  Now comment box opens near the top for better visability
* Bigger tap area for buttons that used to be hard to tap

**What's fixed?**

* Less crashy, more worky.  I found a huge culprit for the crashing and killed it.
* Quicker app loading

**What's are the other features?**

* Excellent multi-account support.  You can comment as any of your verified accounts on the fly.  No need to switch accounts.
* Excellent comment section.  All the good stuff from the website is here.
* Choice of instapaper or readability for website optimization
* Absorbs api's for a lot of the popular sites used for reddit for a native experience.
* Browse subreddits on the fly, and add them as casual without subscribing
* Create groups to have customized mini-front pages for any subreddits (subscribed, casual, or neither)

**What are people saying?**

* ""I kinda feel like I'm obligated to use it"" - my brother
* ""Are you working on that damn app again?"" - my wife
* ""What the hell is reddit?""  - my dad

It won't ever actually disconnect from the wifi network, it just drops the internet connection randomly and reconnects shortly after.  As a daily user of Skype and other games, the random dropping of calls and lagging in games is really unbearable.  All other devices connected to this network are fine, so I'm pretty sure it's not the network or the router.  Also, my laptop is the only device with Windows 8 in the house, so I was thinking that may have something to do with it.

I have done a lot of searching on Google the past few days, and it seems I'm not the only one with this problem.

I bought it from Best Buy, and they have a 14-day return policy.

I had to rebuild my PC with Windows Enterprise edition and when I did I lost the Samsung Picks section. I used WSRESET to reset the cache, tried to look in My Apps etc etc. Nothing I have done will make it come back. The only App I want is the Metro version of S Note. When I got a direct link to the app it won't install. So for some reason the Microsoft store does not recognise my PC as a Samsung so prevents it installing. I am not going back to factory build as it took some time to put on my work image. Anyone have any suggestions?"	t5_2s692	True

We're doing some investigation of a Windows 8 rollout using SCCM 2012 SP1. We can do ""deep-linking"" - installing apps directly from the Windows Store - but it requires user input so it isn't really ideal.  A better alternative for us would be to deploy AppX files directly, which we can do from SCCM - if we can find any.

The question is, then, where the heck do we get AppX files from? The consensus seems to be that it's up to the vendors to supply them - short of writing to each vendor and asking (I have to talk to people now? What is this, the dark ages?) there appears to be no easy way of finding available AppX-distributed apps.

Has anyone had any luck finding and/or installing AppX-based Windows 8 apps?

Thanks!

First of all, where are the big name apps including fb, instagram, gmail, google maps, pandora, grooveshark, youtube, temple run, words with friends, whatsapp, viber, etc? Second of all, how can I find apps made by a specific developer? Third of all, XBox Music app is NOTHING like Zune used to be.....where's all the proper sorting, views, playback options? It feels like an extremely stripped down music player. I'm losing my mind as to why MSFT hasn't approached the developers/companies or offered an incentive to get apps made. I understand that for a lot of the apps I listed above I can just launch the browser and access full desktop websites... but when I'm on the go I appreciate the ""simpler interface"" that apps offer (as opposed to full desktop websites).

I mainly want it for the bus rides to and from my educational institution (can usually take 1-2 hours, I can charge in between), I really want to be able to practice digital drawing and playing a few games like the older total war games, Civ 5 and PSO2, maybe you guys could suggest some awesome tablet games as well :P. I'm also a programmer, so I might do some programming on it from time to time.


I'm really looking at the Surface Pro 128gig, it's not out in Australia yet, but I don't mind waiting for it, because at the moment the touchscreen doesn't support photoshop or GIMP anyway (one of the main reasons I want it).


It's a bit disappointing that none of them seem to have 3G, but I assume using my phone as a wireless access point for internet would do just as well. I don't mind about the small storage size, because I'll just bring my 1tb portable hdd along with me. Battery life also seems to be a bit disappointing on the surface (4 hours, how is that measured? will it be even worse whilst playing games?)


So basically, I'm looking at the Surface Pro 128, but is there anything else on the market or coming soon that may make me want to change my mind?

I know obviously it can only be licenced to one machine - physical or otherwise - at once, and I know that the licence can be legitimately transferred, but if it's to be practical I need to be aware of what's involved in deactivating Windows on one machine and activating another.

I recently set for my fans to run at the lowest speeds at all times, with a target temperature of 45 C. This means that if temperatures ever exceed 45 C, the fans will slowly ramp up in an attempt to attain that target temperature, or run at maximum speed trying.

I started noticing my fans kick up to max speed every five or so minutes when my computer was idle, for no apparent reason. Running RealTemp and the Task Manager, I watched and waited. Sure enough, every five minutes my CPU load would go from 1-2% to 80-100%, and my temperatures would shoot up, followed by an increase in fan speed. The culprit, according to the Task Manager? Windows Defender. Starting Windows Defender showed that the last Quick Scan was at the same time the load and temps shot up. I've tested it several times now, and sure enough, it happens every five minutes when my computer is idle.

I've always been a big fan of MSE, and now that I have Windows 8, Windows Defender is the only antivirus I have, as it has effectively replaced MSE. Windows Defender, however, does not have many of the settings that MSE had, namely, the ability to schedule Quick Scans.

Honestly, it's not a big deal. I have changed the settings on motherboard so the target temperature is higher, and thus the fans don't kick in. Still, as someone with control issues, it bothers me that Windows Defender feels the need to Quick Scan every five minutes. Am I the only person experiencing this? Is there any known solution?

Everything I seem to try doesn't work. It is making it impossible to use the programs I love or to do anything on the computer. I can barely use any programs and it's driving me insane as I just got this computer back up and running again (replacement of HDD, needed it because of fault) and I would really love to use it normally again.

1347049658.0	ziugq	Windows 8: My Take	jayhawk88	12	4	44	"So I finally took the plunge and installed Windows 8 on my main desktop at work. I'm not the kind of person that can install an OS on a VM and get a decent opinion just from working on that; inevitably I don't do a whole lot in the VM and mostly forget about it. I have to dive into the deep end. Now, I've been pretty critical of Windows 8 both here and other sites; not that this should mean anything to you, just to let you know where I'm coming from. I'm also approaching this from mostly an Enterprise viewpoint, since that's where I live. I have Win7 on my home computer of course, but it's mostly a game and surfing machine, I don't run home servers or shares or anything like that. 

A couple of thoughts right off the top:

- If you've been playing with Win8 on a VM or single monitor system, go ahead and put it on a dual-monitor system. You'll be surprised how much better the experience is. Task-bars on both monitors is such an obvious good thing you'll wonder how you ever lived with out it, and the Start Menu taking up the entire screen is not nearly as bad (more on the Start Menu later).

- There doesn't seem to be near the step up from 7 to 8, from a compatibility standpoint. Almost everything I rely for my day-to-day stuff worked well, with minimal tweaking (RSAT does demand some but it's not bad), to just simple ""Run the install in Win7 Compatibility Mode"" (vSphere 5 console). The only thing I had deal-stopping issues with were a couple of obscure third-party programs that I need to support for local users, which is what VM's were made for.

- Speaking of virtualization...if you're interested in Hyper-V that comes with 8, make sure you have an i3/i5/i7, or whatever the AMD equivalent is. My Core 2 Duo computer wasn't up to snuff. An obvious thing if you research it, but something to be aware of before you do a fresh install, if VM's are vital to your work.

**The Good: It's the little things**

There's a lot with Win8 that I honestly do really like. The new file copy thing is maybe a bit cheesy, and for all I know no more accurate than the old days of ""31 Minutes Left..."", but it just gives me a warm fuzzy. Likewise, I really like the new Task Manager. ""Oh, hello, Music App, I see you've used 10 meg of bandwidth in the past 3 days even though I've never used you once"". The Fewer Details mode is actually nice to for just parking on your dekstop somewhere for constant quick-view of your system, if that kind of thing is your bag. 

Also...RETURN OF THE UP FOLDER ARROW IN EXPLORER! It never should have been taken away from us. The new ribbon interface with Explorer....eh, not so much, but I've never been a big ""ribbon"" guy. Those that are will probably love it.

Performance wise, Win8 seems just as robust on my ~2 year old system as Win7 did, perhaps even more so (though that could also be because I did a clean install). Also, while this isn't a Win8 thing per se, the new Remote Desktop Connection Manager you're forced to use (since the old one went away from RSAT) is nice, though I do miss being able to see all my logged in users on all my servers at once.

I still need to get into the finer details of GP and how well it plays with Win8, but so far the answer seems to be very well. WSUS is working on it (not much there, but it is), my security policies are applying, my drives are mapping, etc. 

**The Bad: It's the little things**

Those silly little context pop-ups that you get on the sides and corners are annoying as hell. I know they can be turned off in settings but still, until you do you find these things popping up at the weirdest times, especially when you're moving from one monitor to another. It's distracting. Also, little crap like having every icon created by an install show up on your Start Menu by default, forcing you to go clean all the worthless stuff up, which itself is annoying (right, navigate down to the Unpin from Start button...can't just use the Delete key, oh no). Not being able to rename items that get plunked down on your Start Menu, at least via the Start Menu interface. Having to go find and pin icons that you probably use often, like Notepad, My Computer, Control Panel, Calc, etc, that are buried in that ""All Apps"" option. Once you get your desktop setup the way you like, things are fine, but getting there is a much more painful process than it needs to be.

And let's be frank here: Desktop is still really important. Some things, like the built-in Messaging, Pictures, Music, etc apps, seem to do that ""run full screen"" thing that doesn't throw you back to the Desktop, but most other apps don't, including IE weirdly enough (but Chrome does?). Office 2010 apps don't do this either. You're still going to be using the desktop a bunch, which makes the new Start Menu decision by Microsoft even more bizarre. I'd understand it if everything ran like an iOS app or something, but that's not what's going on here, at least on a desktop computer. 

Really, here's my main takeaway. Basically we got Windows 7.5 here, with a few new tweaks and a substantial new Start Menu. Start is really the elephant in the room here, and I'm sorry, but there's just no getting around it: The new Start Menu makes your computing experience more difficult. Yes, you use it for a bit and you get used to it, but I shouldn't have to ""get used"" to fundamental things about my operating system, just because they were changed for dubious reasons. Don't try to tell me this is a fundamental shift in UI theory or it was impossible to include an old start menu for coding reasons or whatever. You can pin whatever you like to the taskbar in the Desktop, why not be able to pin the Start Menu, and have it run like any other app? Why not at least give the user the option of using the new full screen Start Menu, or defaulting back to the old way, like XP gave us? There's no good reason to do this, beyond ""We want the desktop and tablet experience to fell the same"". 

The new Start Menu breaks my workflow; instead of just being able to click something on the screen, I have to locate the Window key and open it that way: No this isn't hard but when you've become accustomed to doing something a certain way over ~15 years it's jarring. Or I have to go hover over the right place on the screen to get reboot options. Or instead of just clicking Start-Run, I now have to go right click in the right place on the screen for the Run command (or remember to use a Windows key shortcut). It's important to keep your Start Menu well organized, lest you be buried in a mountain of icons that are now significantly bigger, yet literally everything a program wants to install is just thrown on there with no attempt at organization, leaving that as a task you have to do. It's almost like there's a fight going on here between the Start Menu and the Desktop people at Microsoft. Clearly MS thinks that you shouldn't be relying on your Desktop as much, which is why it's more difficult to put program icons on it, why the new Start Menu is full screened and can run some stuff without even going to the Desktop...but only a handful of apps (including Microsoft's own) can pull off the no-desktop trick, you're going to find yourself pinning even more stuff than normal to your taskbar to have it within easy reach (encouraging desktop use; I barely use the Start Menu now).

Maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon and stubbornly holding on to ""how it used to be"", but the overall feeling I get in dealing with the new Start Menu is frustration. If I had the old Start Menu, like I say, I'd basically have Win7 with a few tweaks, but perhaps that's the point. Start Menu aside, it doesn't really seem like there's a lot new here, certainly not enough to justify a new/upgrade OS purchase/install. I'm going to keep Win8 on my main for now, because it's there and I'm still checking it out, but if my hard drive melts down tomorrow and I have to reinstall again, I think I might go back to 7."	t5_2s692	True

LordTilde	10	2	3	"I need certain software that I have already activated on my computer, however, Samsung messed up the initial install of Windows 8, and I've had a lot of issues with the computer. I created a custom refresh image using recimg.exe /createimage 

I need to know if my licenses will carry over with the software that needs them, any ideas?"	t5_2s692	True

When I'm plugged in, I'd want high performance, but when I'm on the go, I'd want power saver. Is there any way to do this or do I just have to do it manually every time?	t5_2s692	True
1373127355.0	1hr4m5	Accidentally got Windows 8.0 to boot to desktop. Any ideas how?	Cow_Pusher	11	4	6	"[1st install booted to desktop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzzq7UvDeS4)

[2nd install did not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHIvc34RGQE)

I was experimenting with Windows, performing a fresh install after each experiment. On one of the installs, it booted straight to desktop, and I cannot figure out what allowed that to happen.

It's of little significance given the incoming 8.1 feature, but I found it interesting, so let me know your thoughts."	t5_2s692	True

I never thought Linux would look so interesting until now. The only thing keeping me on Windows now is the games..."	t5_2s692	True

1372117836.0	1h04ml	Starting to roll out WIN 8. Starting with our least tech savvy people. HALP?	82bazillionguns	8	2	22	This isn't insulting them. They're great at what they do and I couldn't do their job. But technology is not their forte. Are there some links (or downloadable PDF's) that would be good to help get them acclimated to WIN 8 written in an easy to understand style and with some screen shots? I'll be giving them some hands on teaching, but I would like to give them something they can take around with them as they travel.	t5_2s692	True
1372111688.0	1gzx0g	Thoughts on Windows 8 touch screen vs Windows 7 touch screen?	burkhalp74	10	4	13	"Hi all,

I have a user who we just ordered 4 touch screen Windows 8 desktops to put in each of our QA labs... and as soon as they came in, the user asked for us to downgrade to 7. I am advising against, on the ground that the touch interface is much better in Windows 8 than it is in 7. What are all of your thoughts on this?

Thanks!"	t5_2s692	True

I just ordered a new PC, and it comes with Windows 8, and I am told the license key is built INTO the system.  So my question is, if I download windows 8.1 when it comes out, should I be able to upgrade and select ""keep nothing""?   and let it install, that way the bloat ware is gone."	t5_2s692	True
