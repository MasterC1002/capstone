1326727527.0	ojcl7	I miss booze.	NakedTonyDanza	87	7	15	"tl;dr: Tell your bottle you love her tonight.

I miss booze.  When I was a kid I used to stutter, the other kids tortured me, and it destroyed my self confidence.  At the ripe age of 17, I stole a 1.75 liter bottle of Beefeater Gin from the country club I worked at (which became a habit), and started drinking assorted hard alcohol at school (which also became a habit).  It's been said that ""whiskey is the key that sets the monkey free"", and boy if that crazy little bastard didn't break me out of my shell and show everyone a good time.

Booze is also partially responsible for meeting the love of my life - she was attracted to the outgoing adventurous risk taking guy and fell in love with the inner nerd that never would have had the balls to ask her out.  Most of our funniest, entertaining and endearing stories have a solid booze backbone.

Remember all of those awesome stories your grandparents told you?  And you know how you clean up your stories for kids?  Put 2 and 2 together.  Yup - your grandparents were boozing during all of those youthful adventures.  Your parents probably were too.  It's a long, grand tradition.

But it helps for benign matters too.  Shitty jobs?  No problem.  The world's gone mad?  Great!  If it crashes down, I still know how to make beer, wine, and distill hard alcohol.  When they say it becomes a part of you, they're not just referring to the molecules.  Alcohol has personality.  Stick with it long enough and it takes on a life of its own, partially breathed by you.

I recall learning in college that the liver is the fastest regenerating organ in the body; you just have to give it a break every now and again from the nonstop abuse.  I'd liken that knowledge to teaching a novice computer user how to use regedit - it's just enough information given to someone that has just enough skill to royally fuck everything up.  Fueled by the somewhat errant knowledge that my liver would go back to normal after years of abuse if I'd just stop for a while kept me hammering it down with the general idea that I'd stop when I turned 30. 

On my 30th birthday my significant other and I got tatered at my party with the office hotties and had drunken debaucherous group sex.  That one never would have happened sober.  Maybe I forgot my self-promise to stop drinking after that.

And then last year after 17 years straight, I caught something that attacked my liver and did some permanent damage, and made me look like an ugly pregnant lady for a few months as a bonus fuck you.  The damage isn't consistent with booze, but it's not like it was helping.  What this means though is that if I were to keep drinking the life expectancy goes to about a year.

I'm a firm believer in quality of life.  The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long, right?  And yet at the same time: 1 year with booze vs. 40 years with no booze?  Fuck me running, the choice is unfortunately clear when one of the candles has a flamethrower ponted at it.

A few things happened when I stopped - my male pattern baldness disappeared and my hair grew back so full and wild I look like Andrew Jackson.  My muscles (apparently atrophied) grew back on their own.  My blood pressure went back to normal.  Sex drive returned to teenage status.  A few other things.

Mentally is the bigger change.  Alcohol changed me, permanently.  You know those stories about how acid changed a person's perception of the world for good?  I have the same acid story; I also have the same story with alcohol, although they may have been less revelatory and more along the line of personality training sessions.  The lessons in confindence I learned over the last 17 years stuck.  Confidence (not arrogance) will get you better jobs easier, and it will get you laid; it's really underrated.  The stuttering is still gone.  The only thing that actually became worse is the short term memory.  But it is what it is.

It's generally at this point in the story that people tell you that it wasn't worth it - here's where it's supposed to become a cautionary tale.  But fuck that, it wouldn't be true to either of us.  The truth is, I still miss it. 

Stopping drinking was like taking that friend of yours aside, the one that's fun as hell but always getting people in trouble, the one that goes way back with you, and telling them you can't see them anymore.  It's depressing as hell.  Booze may be technically be an inanimate object, but it's still heart-wrenching.

So friends of alcohol, all I ask is this: when you curl up with a bottle of liquid courage tonight after a lousy day of enduring whatever the world foisted on you, take an extra moment to think of how lucky you are to still have your friend in your life (and maybe secretly vow to take a break every now and again, let your poor liver regenerate).

That's it.  Both can be found on any internet supplement store, and after using this method for over a year I can absolutely confirm it works for me.

I am actually trying to distance myself from alcohol, but for those of you who still drink, it's invaluable advice to prevent that horrible headache, nausea, and all the rest.  I regularly drink half a liter or more in a night, and this gets rid of all but the lethargy of a hangover for me and works amazingly about 98% of the time.

However, I guess I got unlucky and ended up with a pretty full can of whipped lightning that I couldn't get at because all the Nitrous had leaked out. 

So, when I finally remembered to, I send an email through their ""Contact Us"" page, not knowing exactly what to expect.

Here's what I wrote:  

 *Hey guys, I bought a can of this stuff just to try it out. Turns out I can't even do that because after a little bit all the gas had already been used up and I was stuck with a full can of cream that I can't even get at.*

Paul emails me back:

 *I apologize that you had this problem; the last thing we want to do is put bad product in the marketplace.  There are a few reasons why a can could go bad, for instance, we did receive some bad cans from our supplier after they moved their production facility but I thought all of those cans had either been returned and or removed.  There is also always the chance that something went wrong in our production facility.  Regardless of why we stand behind every can we sell.  Although it is illegal for me to replace the can, please send me your address and I will reimburse you for the product.  Also, if you get a chance please give me a call, I would like to ask you a few questions, hopefully we can learn something that may help prevent this problem from reoccurring.  I appreciate the fact that you spent your money to try Whipahol and I want to do what I can to make sure you get your money's worth.*

About a week passes,  I get a letter in the mail:

I think that going to clubs and buying overpriced beer is a waste of money where I live . (Ireland)Why is it that whenever people realise that I have been drinking alone that they feel sorry for me? Don't feel sorry for me! I know a lot of people drink due to depression and I feel for them but for christs sake drinking alone doesn't have to be attached to lables such as 'sad', 'depressed' and 'lonely'. Am I the only one that feels this way?

Fortunately he was cool after I explained I meant a blue moon 'beer' and got me one of those, but someone in the group I was with asked if they could have it and she could. So we tried it and it was absolutely pure alcohol, we think it consisted of UV blue, vodka, rum and definitely 2+ more things I couldn't depict, but this drink got more than a few people pretty tipsy..

I bought this today for a dollar. My initial Google search yielded some clues, and the best I can figure is that this is a South Korean soju from probably the mid-90's. 

The only latin alphabet characters say ""BO~BAE"" on the label and ""BO HAE"" on the bottle. It is 360ml and 25% (alcohol, I presume). Wikipedia said that this company changed its name to HITE in 1998, hence my estimate on the age. Everything else on the label is in, what I think is, Korean. However, my camera is not good enough to get a detail of the text.

Basically I need to know if anyone knows more about this particular brand and if this bottle is **okay to drink.** I've read some interesting stuff about soju and formaldehyde in my search, so any info would be appreciated. There is no sediment or anything floating in this bottle and the liquid is completely clear.

Different types of alcohol have different prices- A bottle of cheap vodka will be cheaper than a bottle of, say, irish cream. If I order a straight shot of vodka (for whatever reason) that should cost less than if I order a B-52 (Which is a shot of irish cream, coffee liqueur, and Grand Marnier). But what if I order something in between, like a white russian (vodka + coffee liqueur)? Would it be halfway between those two prices, or would it be the same as one of them?

To summarize my question: Do bars have very precise pricing on their drinks/shots, or is there just a couple price tiers? Do expensive shots cost the same as the cheaper ones? This question mostly applies to bars/clubs, since restaurants tend to be more upfront about their prices."	t5_2qi6q	True

16 shots or half the bottle of mohawk or everclear
6 five hour energy shots per gallon
1 crushed box of the largest sweet tarts you can find
4 - 5 quarts of red kool-aid
Fill the rest with cold water.

The longer you let the sweet tarts dissolve the sweeter it will be.

I figured you'd need to hit most of the food groups, but concentrate mostly on carbs, salts and protien. I came up with a fried sammich of sorts that I call ""The Clogger"". It goes a little something like this:

* Grill 4 rashers of bacon until really crispy.

* Hand cut some chunky break for making french toast/eggy bread.

* When making the eggy part of the bread, use about 3 eggs and a decent slug of milk for 2 pieces of bread.

* Soak the Bread until it is saturated, then bung one slice in a pre-heated pan. When one side is cooked, flip it and start cooking the other side.

* Layer your bacon on the cooked (upwards facing) piece of toast. cover the bacon in grated cheese (and some hot sauce if you're into that, I know I sure as hell am).

* Put the cooked side of your second piece of toast on top of the cheese and leave to sit for a second so the cheese starts to melt. 

* Then flip the whole damn thing over. Grate some cheese on the top side and leave it to melt while the under side of the sammich cooks. Once done, bung it on a plate, with a large dollop of coleslaw on top of the melted cheese.

If you can get it, have it with a cold glass bottle of Irn-Bru (easy if you're in Scotland, and some other places in the UK, mebbe Canada as well). If you can't get it, I like to have root beer instead (harder to get in scotland/UK), but any soda will do really.

Enjoy :)"	t5_2qi6q	True

1/3 Pink Lemonade

And of course vodka!

However your body runs out of water very quickly and can no longer do this so it begins to pull water from organs such as your brain.  As it pulls the water from your brain it will make it so that you have a headache and feel very sick the next day.  The trick to not having a hangover is to drink one cup of water for every drink of alcohol you consume.  Whether its a beer, a shot, or a glass of wine, drink a glass of water and your body will be able to properly flush it out of your system without pulling the water from your brain.

At the bar, I ordered Avión Silver neat and my friend ordered Jameson neat. Upon receiving our drinks, we began to sip. Now - I know my tequila, very well to say the least. What was poured for me wasn't Avión. I did see the bartender pour my sifter from the Avión bottle, but shit, what I was drinking tasted like fucking motor oil. Something was swapped into that bottle. I immediately returned it under the suspicion that I probably wasn't drinking what I ordered.

I've been to a couple other bars where ordering something more top shelf tastes a lot like some shitty well drink, and I wouldn't rule out the fact that there was some swapping taking place at these other bars, too.

For obvious reasons, it's illegal to swap the contents of the bottle or give me something other than I asked for without first telling me.

First, a little background:

--I have recently graduated college and am currently looking for full-time work. In the meantime, I have acquired a job at a Wine &amp; Spirits shop. 

--I live in the middle of the Bourbon trail in central KY.

I feel that I am well versed in my Beer and Bourbon knowledge, and to a lesser extent, spirits in general. However, I know very little about Wine (our main seller).

Like any liquor store, we have our 10 AM winos and the like, but our shop, being located in the heart of horse country, largely caters to an upper-middle class to upper class consumer. Many of our customers come in knowing what they want, but others like recommendations or have questions.

/r/alcohol, what I'm looking for is a basic guide to selling/recommending wines (and spirits even). Our store is arranged by country, and then we have California wines, regional wines, and economy wines (if that helps).

AN EXAMPLE: Yesterday, a lady came in looking for a wine to use in a sauce that she was making. I had no idea what to recommend, but eventually we agreed on a chardonnay.

I know that I could research wine and spirits more thoroughly, but honestly I'm not looking to do that. What I'm requesting is something similar to a ""cheat sheet"". Some basic advice for a wine and spirits SELLER--not an enthusiast. 

Thanks guys.

I'm interning in LA over the summer in film and have set up some meetings over drinks with a few of my contacts. I'll have just turned 21, so it'll be my first time having a drink at an actual bar/restaurant/whatever. I'm not a big drinker to begin with, so I don't know much about alcohol aside from making things that I like from whatever bottles I find at parties (e.g., some kind of juice + vodka, rum and Coke).

I'm basically looking for drinks I can order that will send the ""right"" message to my contacts, if you know what I mean. I don't want to look like a complete ignorant moron, but I also don't want to look like I have been working on building a tolerance for a long time. I guess I want to strike a balance between young and casual, but at the same time professional and mature. If that makes any sense.

So I do like rum and Coke and vodka + fruit juices, but I don't really know how to graduate from these. I don't like the taste of beer, and I think that wine might look a bit too ""old"" for me. I also don't want anything too strong.

In 2009 I made a commitment to never buy the same bottle of liquor twice. It can be frustrating sometimes, but wandering around liquor stores looking for something new has led me to try many types of alcohol that I probably would not have otherwise, and trying new varieties has become one of my favorite things. It is always interesting to find something I've never heard of that ends up being a national drink of several countries elsewhere in the world.

I've gotten to the point now, though, where I've stopped seeing very many new types of liquor in my casual searching, so I wanted to see if you guys can spot any huge gaps, which I'm sure must be there. Here is a list of genres I've come up with looking through my past purchases (unfortunately half of my list is MIA at the moment, but hopefully I'm not missing too much):

* Whiskey (rye, Canadian, Irish, Scotch, bourbon, honey)

* Vodka (various sources)

* Rum (dark, light (aged), white, spiced, cachaca, aguardiente)

* Brandy/Congac/Brandy de Jerez

* Dark/sweet herbal digestifs (Jager/Unicum/etc)

* Light/dry herbal digestifs (*Chartreuse*/others?)

* Palinka/Rakia/Grappa/Slivovitz 

* Akvavit

* Moonshine/White Whiskey/Grain/Potcheen (Corn, rye, potatoe, etc) 

* Tequila (white, gold, *mezcal*)

* Gin (Sloe)

* Sake/Soju

* Arak/Raki/Ouzo/Sambuca/Absinthe

Notes: I generally considering anything less than 30% ABV not really a liquor. Also, I try to limit myself to about 25 $/bottle including shipping, so that obviously limits me some. Also also, I tend to prefer to drink things neat or on the rocks, which excludes lots of extremely sweet liqueurs and mixed drinks (although that may be my next quest).

I feel like there are a lot of varieties of light digestif I'm missing, for instance I was only very recently introduced to chartreuse (that shelf is always so intimidating, and a lot of them are either very similar or completely unique), and when I looked up aguardiente to remember what country it was from, I found that pretty much every South American country has a distinct variety.

So, tell me what I'm missing out on/berate me for my grouping of types!

EDIT: 
Thanks all! Here are some ones you've suggested:

* Whiskey: Indian(Amrut), Japanese Whiskey (Hibiki, Yamazaki, Suntory), Strait Wheat  (Bernheim), Oat (High West, Koval)
* Fenret, Root
* Gins: Old Tom, Genever, New Western
* Pisco, Armagnac, Eau du Vie, Poire Williams, Apple Brandy
* Calvados
* Mextaxa
* Koshu Sake
* Pulque http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque

Excited to start finding these :-)

I drank often in high school, but then I took a break for a couple of years. I recently started socially drinking, but I've noticed I can't handle my liquor at all. I used to pride myself on being a 'literate drunk' after drinking all night. Now, I'll drink 3 beers and start getting drunk. 

Last night, I had a glass of 2/5ths Vodka and 3/5ths orange juice. After I drank most of the glass I was pretty drunk. My friend told me I should be worried that that little amount of alcohol could get me drunk.

I'll share a bit of my backstory -- I was born and raised in a dry town to a mormon family.  Due to the expectations pressed on me from an early age to adulthood, I never really had an opportunity to enjoy alcoholic beverages.  
Since moving away some years ago, I have had a few drinks before with mixed results.  However, I am self concious when I drink because of my limited experience.  I don't really know what kinds of drinks only asshole fratboys drink, or what drinks are enjoyable, so it's a bit of a gamble.  I'm okay with moderation and drunken behavior, it's more *what* to enjoy that I'm hung up on.

1340875694.0	vqf48	I just realized... I probably look like a fucking alcoholic. (A story from Safeway just now)	thebornotaku	22	4	15	"So it's about two in the morning where I am, I've been off work for a little bit and I think to myself: ""*I want a goddamn white russian*"". I figure why not, I don't work tomorrow or anything so I can drink tonight without worrying. I figure I have the Kahlua, and some whole milk which will do in a pinch. I don't have a lot of money until payday so I figure I'll just go get a fifth of cheap vodka or whatever and call it good.

So remember that bit about how I got off work earlier? It's been about two hours since I got off but I haven't taken my work shirt off yet. I took my pants off but to go to the store, I put on some dirty basketball shorts I had on my floor. I put on my work shoes (ratty looking slip-on vans that I really need to replace) and grab my keys. My dog perks up because normally when I grab my keys at 2am, it means he's coming with me, and he's not wrong now. We hop in the car and drive off to Safeway. For the purposes of this story (and because it's the truth), I drive a 1980's Volvo station wagon that (admittedly) has a lot of trash in it -- fast food wrappers, empty soda bottles, etc. It kinda looks like I live in it...

So anywho, I drive the three minutes to Safeway and walk inside. It's just past 2am. As I'm walking in, I think to myself ""it's probably gonna look sketch coming in to Safeway just after 2am and buying cheap liquor."" So I decide, kind of jokingly to myself, how I would prove to the cashier that I'm sober if they give me any shit. As I'm walking towards the liquor, I start doing that thing where you touch your nose. A manager spots me and jokingly says ""doing a sobriety test?"". I laugh and tell him ""nah, I'm just messing around"" and go to grab my liquor. He walks off before I get on the aisle.

I get on the aisle, grab a fifth of the cheapest stuff and walk towards the checkout. The manager is there. I bet this looks super sketch now.  I put my fifth down on the belt and the cashier grabs it and says ""sorry man, you're about five minutes late"". I realize that CA doesn't allow ANY alcohol sales past 2am and go ""oh right, damn.""

Well apparantly that was enough for the manager to decide to follow me out to my car for whatever reason. The fake-sobriety-test, the kinda ratty clothes, the fact that I haven't shaved in a week and the cheap vodka... it's easy to see how it's adding up in his head. He follows me out, sees the shitty car. Sees the dog in the shitty car. Probably adds up even better now. Then I fumble with my keys a little bit (which I'm sure doesn't help my case) and unlock the door. As I open the door, two bits of trash fell out. Just what I needed to help my image. I scooped up the trash, tossed it back in the car and drove home. It wasn't until I started driving home that I realized how bad that all looked.

TL;DR: if you're going to buy booze, don't do it 5 minutes after the cutoff, after you haven't shaved, with ratty ass clothing and your work t-shirt on, and then retreating to your shitty 80's volvo with a dog in it. people are gonna think you're an alcoholic."	t5_2qi6q	True

I just picked up the new Smirnoff Sorbet from the liquor store. Figured I'd try it out since I'm counting my calories to lose that winter fluff. LOL I opened it up and smelled it to see if it was going to be strong or not very flavorful so I knew what to expect. To my surprise it smelled just like a regular mango fruit type drink. If you really concentrate you can smell a hint of alcohol. The taste was pleasant as well. As someone who just started drinking again after a year or two off I did not need a chaser after this vodka. It tasted great, not overwhelmingly fruity but very smooth. I really enjoy it, the after taste was just fruit flavor. You can taste the alcohol for a bit as it hits your tongue but it does not burn going down, again very smooth liquor. If you have a girlfriend who you cannot get to drink with you BUY HER THIS! Or if you aren't a fan of alcohol flavor definitely pick this up. They have two other flavors as well. Guarantee you or whoever you get this for will enjoy it.

First, the mojito, with it's mint freely floating around, is difficult to drink without a straw, as you're left constantly picking undesirables out from between your teeth. It's vaguely reminiscent of junior prom. And not in a good way.


Second, as you drink the mojito, all the sugar settles to the bottom of the glass. Through the straw implement, you are essentially creating a filtration system, where the alcohol/lime/mint/soda water is being filtered through a sugar bed. Dramatically enhancing the flavour of the drink.

I've been drinking every weekend since I was 17. I drink beer and wine pretty often, but I feel like I should be ordering something that will get me drunk more efficiently when I'm paying for overpriced drinks at the bar. I also drink vodka mixed drinks at home pretty often.

My favorite type of beer is the Belgian/Blue Moon type, and my favorite type of wine is white, usually Pinot Grigio. If that helps any.
I like clear liquors much more than darker ones. I enjoy a Long Island Iced Tea but I always feel silly and immature when I order one. I love amaretto and I like the taste of sweet, fruity mixed drinks, but I feel like these are too silly and girly. I want to find a drink that is good, strong, and more adult than something like a Cosmo.

I know this post probably isn't the best written but I am a bit tipsy at the moment :P So, any suggestions on what ""my drink"" should be? Thanks in advance.


EDIT: Since everyone is saying ""Don't care what other people think,"" I feel I should address that. I *dont* care what other people think of what I order. I am a girl so I'm not just looking for some manly drink so that I don't feel emasculated lol. Like I said in a comment below: ""I'm looking for something simple but not just straight up liquor. Something classic that I'll always want to order."" I'm looking for something that I want to be my default drink for a long time, not what other people will think is an appropriate classy drink for me.

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions, I will try to reply to each comment when I try certain drinks. :)"	t5_2qi6q	True

* **Gin** (Plymouth or local)
* **Rum** (Ron Zapaca 23, appleton estates)
* **Spiced Rum** (Captain Morgan: Private Stock)
* **Tequila** (epsilon, el Jimador or Hornitos)
* **Whiskey** (Old Grand Dad 100)
* **Smoked Whiskey** (Black Bottle Scotch)
* **Coffee Liquor** (Kahlua)
* **Bitters** (Angostura, Orange, and Campari)
* **Orange Liquor** (Mathilde Orange XO, Grand Mariner, or Cointreau)
* **Bourbon** (Recommendations?)
* **Dry Vermouth**

Additional Recommendations:

* Lillet
* Madiera
* LBV Port
* Elderflower liquer
* amarula cream liquor

One of the challenges, involves ordering/drinking/giving-someone-else a mixed drink you haven't had before. I humbly ask for your collective wisdom.

- I'll have to order three of them over the course of the night; so I'd prefer it not be insanely expensive.

1370806785.0	1fzwqo	Alcohol intolerance?	poopiedoodles	15	2	10	"Over the years, I seem to tolerate alcohol worse and worse. I have a large array of allergies (it's quite impressive, actually). Since allergies can start and stop at any time without warning, I'm starting to worry perhaps something in alcohol has added itself to the list.

I get really mucus-y after about two/three drinks. Wine is worst, followed by beer. Headaches and minor stomach aches can follow. It feels different than a hangover and can happen even if I never get buzzed. It can also last for days and start immediately. It also doesn't matter if I have three drinks one after another or three within a long stretch of time. It's usually not as severe if I drink with a meal or have more water.

When I looked up these symptoms, it popped up as either an allergy or alcohol intolerance. I assume it's an allergy since when I was younger, this never happened. I also wondered if perhaps when I was younger I was mixing allergy medication with drinking. I drank a lot and took allergy pills a lot, so I assume there was some unintentional crossover.

Has this happened to anyone else? And is there any allergy medication that's safe to regularly take with alcohol? If I wasn't effected while on medication, then I think it would be safe to say it's an allergy. I've tried just about every allergy medication at one point or another and none make me drowsy in the slightest. But I also don't want to take any unnecessary risks if specific medications are unsafe to mix.

I realize the easiest solution is to limit myself to a single drink or stop drinking altogether, but that's honestly not going to happen. It's not such a huge issue that I plan to rush to my doctor, but I plan to mention it next time I'm in. Still, I thought it would be worth asking if anyone had any other ideas."	t5_2qi6q	True
1369559326.0	1f2p97	Brand new to drinking, want to learn to appreciate the finer Alcohols	FubsyGamr	20	6	41	"Sorry for the long post, but I wanted you to know where I'm coming from.

I was born and raised a Mormon, and no alcohol touched my lips until I was 23. At that time, I left my religion, and swapped to atheism (wa-hoo). Anywho, not here to discuss religion xD

So, at that time I tried a few alcoholic drinks, but I never really got into it. I liked the more 'girly' drinks like Daiquiris and Margaritas, but I only had them once or twice. I tried Guiness, but I didn't really care for it (it was really, really strong). I ended up drifting away from it for about a year.

As funny as this sounds, I just started watching the show Hannibal. In it, Hannibal Lecter is a very refined man (and a cannibal, haha), who seems to appreciate finer alcohols. I decided I wanted to try again, in a similar fashion as someone like Hannibal.

My intentions aren't to drink just for the purpose of getting drunk. I've been to the college parties, but those days are behind me. I want to drink the finer drinks, and sure I don't mind getting a buzz, but my goal isn't to get so wasted that I puke on my couch. Just a nice, fancy whisky or scotch or something, to have after dinner while watching Game of Thrones, you know?

So, I asked some coworkers for tips, and I went out and bought some stuff today, that I'm going to try over this week. I know, I know, I should have come to you first, but I didn't think about asking reddit until my purchases had been made. I'm wondering if you all agree with what was suggested, where you would go next, and what you would recommend in general!

I was told to buy (and have now bought):

* Evan Williams Honey Whiskey
* Vanilla Rum + Vanilla Coke
* Blue Moon beer, with a slice of orange

How do those sound? Any specific foods I should eat with them? I feel so dumb, but I don't even know the basics. I picked up some 11.5 oz Highball Glasses. I have the glasses in the freezer, along with a bag of ice. The alcohols are in the fridge. I also picked up a 'jigger'. I was told the Honey Whiskey I can drink on it's own. The vanilla rum/coke should be 1 shot of rum, full glass of ice, and then fill with vanilla coke. The blue moon beer should be the whole thing in a bigger glass, along with an orange (kind of like a lemon slice in water).

Please, teach me and guide me! I'm really interested in this, but I want to make sure my experiences are good :)

Thanks for any/all advice!

p.s. I don't even really understand the difference between whiskey, scotch, bourbon, all of that...when do you drink what?

Being 40 years old now, did the age enhance the flavor or ruin it? It has always been kept in a cabinet, inside of my parents house at room temperature. Not that I plan on opening it, just a curious question......

ADDITION: I didn't know you guys would gladly take the bottle for me (and test it only for science I'd hope!) That's awesome! It is my parents bottle that they received on their 1 year wedding anniversary back in '83. So it was 11 years old then. I'll see if I can get a picture of it today and I'll post it.

A thick recipe book is terrible because when you're starting out, because you inevitably are reading recipes that require ingredients you haven't thought to buy.

This app fixes that problem.  You tell it what you have, and it shows you which, of thousands of recipes, you can make.  Then, it tells you what ingredients you should consider getting next, to get the biggest bang for your buck.  (""If you get cream, you can make 50 more recipes!"")

Please don't distribute this outside r/alcohol yet.  I'm posting it here so that you can give me feedback and report problems.  I'll put this in the Market in a few days, with no cost, but an in-app donation option. 

The only permission it asks for is ""Internet"", so that whatever drinks and ingredients are popular can get suggested in future versions (soon, ""People who also like your favorites also like The Blah Blah.""), and (soon) it can download recipe-book updates.  There are no ads.  Those suck.

Now I'm more of a beer guy and the occasional scotch or wine however I have IBS and beer and wine really mess with my IBS so as an alternative I've been drinking a lot of vodka and energy drinks mixes, this is where it gets very very weird.

I have noticed that whenever I have these not only does my confidence level increase but my ""awareness"" levels also increase, meaning I can pick up on subtle clues, this is specially interesting because I completely SUCK at this when I'm sober, I can for the life of me pick up any form of subtlety, at first I thought it was only a coincidence BUT I did an experiment and went one weekend without drinking any of these mixes and didn't notice any irregular levels of ""awareness"" and then the next time I went out(couple of weeks after that) had another one and surprise it came back!

I got turned off to whiskey/bourbon pretty early, due to a real bad ""first night in college"" that involved a full handle of Evan between my brother and I. I switched to spiced rum, and went with it. Now, rum is getting a bit too sweet (the hangovers blow) for me. Then, for my 21st, I got a bottle of Maker's and another of Jack. And now I'm back on board and trying to learn as much as possible.

So far, I've enjoyed mostly name brands. I like Maker's Mark, Wild Turkey, and Jack Daniels. Though its probably taboo to admit, I also actually enjoy Fireball a good bit as well (probably just the college student in me). 

A friend of mine just turned me on to honey blends, so that's whats currently in the front of my collection. I liked the Jack version ""Tennessee Honey"", and I just picked up a bottle of Evan Williams Honey Reserve for the sorority function I'm going to tonight. I've read surprisingly AMAZING reviews of it over its competitors, so I'm pretty excited to try it out.

I really wanted to make a thread that encompassed a few questions I have, as well as start some discussion on the topics brought up. I imagine this has been done before, but whatever.

**Best Whiskey?** **Best Bourban?** **For the price?**

**Opinions on flavored blends?** (honey/cinnamon/apple and the like)

**Irish whiskey vs American?** I know the difference between bourbon, whiskey, sour mash, and scotch (based entirely off of a History channel piece I watched about it with my dad, so feel free to correct me)

**Best way to drink?** **On the rocks vs Mixing?** pros and cons to both? I'm assuming on the rocks is the overwhelming favorite, just figured I'd see if there was a voice to the mixing community. 

**Why/WHEN drink Whiskey or Bourbon over other liquor?**

I'm new to this subreddit, and drinking in general, so bear with me. I'm sure a lot of my questions/opinions may be stupid, but I'm trying to learn. Thanks in advance."	t5_2qi6q	True

A generic dry martini generally is:
1. Vodka (or gin)
2. Vermouth... but virtually none.
3. Ice... which you shake and get rid of.

... So you are left with cold vodka with almost no vermouth.

I've been doing a study abroad in Cairo, Egypt, and I just wanted to share with y'all the experience of drinking beer here. First of all, although there are a few locations where imported beer can be found, these are uncommon and expensive and not worth mentioning. (In the touristy coastal cities, this may be a little different).

Alcohol in Egypt is definitely under attack by the current Islamist government, and many in Egyptian society outwardly condemn alcohol as a corrupting commodity that is tearing apart Egypt's social fabric. It's a bunch of hogwash; plenty of Egyptians drink, especially the Christians and liberals. Even some MB members are known to sneak some Stellas through their drivers. I would still say that a majority of Egyptians don't drink, however.

Beer itself is generally considered the least 'offensive' alcohol in Egypt - many Muslims who oppose the sale of liquor will tolerate beer.

*****

**The Breweries**

Most of the beer in Egypt is controlled by one company: Heineken. They brew several different brands of beer, most notably the local Egyptian brand, Stella. All of this production occurs at the [Al Ahram brewery](http://www.alahrambeverages.com/), originally founded in 1897 in Giza and now located in Obour City in northeast Cairo.

Al Ahram was nationalized in the 1960's under President Nasser and privatized again in 1997 under Mubarak. It was purchased by Heineken in 2002, and the current look of the company was finalized in 2006.

There is another smaller and newer brewery called Egyptian International Beverages Company, but they're almost not worth mentioning. They produce [Luxor Classic](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19457/55388), which I have yet to encounter in six months.

I have also heard of [Al Masria](http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/almasria.html) brewery, which produces a few beers, though I also have yet to encounter any of their beers.

*****

**The Beers**

*Heineken*

This is the same Heineken you will drink anywhere outside of Holland. It tastes like the Heineken I have had in Texas, that is to say, not particularly good.

*[Stella](http://i.imgur.com/MEgpfOZ.jpg)*

Stella is the preferred local beer. Some of the local bars are simply known as ""Stella bars."" The brand has been around for 115 years, and with it the brewers have perfected mediocrity. It is one of the simplest lagers you will ever drink, and is very filling for something with so little flavor. I believe that Stella sits at 4.5% ABV.

No matter where you get your Stella, in my experience you can expect about 1 in 5 to be skunked. There's no complaining to the bars about it, they will taste it and tell you it's fine. This makes me very sad.

*[Sakara Gold](http://i.imgur.com/ApIAOCd.jpg)*

The major ""competitor"" to Stella, though made by the same company. Sakara Gold is just another lager - often a tiny bit cheaper than Stella, and some wizards claim that they can taste a difference. The major advantage over Stella is that Sakara has 5% ABV.

*[Sakara Weizen](http://i.imgur.com/rU7EAGc.jpg)*

Very hard to find, and thank God for that. In all honesty, the worst hefeweizen experience I have ever had. It just tasted sour. Let's just move along.

*[Sakara King](http://i.imgur.com/AuQpZQA.jpg)*

Sakara's ""high alcohol"" offering, it drinks more like a malt liquor than a beer at 10%. And it tastes like a shitty malt liquor, too! This is a great beer if you're just trying to forget that you're having to drink beer in Cairo.

*[Meister Max](http://i.imgur.com/VffNuvA.jpg)*

Meister Max is another high alcohol offering, and although more popular than Sakara King it tastes the same. Most bars that carry Stella also carry Meister Max. I once had a taxi driver offer to find us an open beer shop at 4am if we bought him one. It was a great deal. Meister Max is terrible, and you will get heartburn.

******

**The Drinking Experience**

Decent bars in Egypt are few are far between, though when you find one it will generally be packed. You will often be seated at an itty bitty table with complete strangers, which can be fun sometimes. You will never find yourself drinking on a pleasant patio or outdoor area unless it is on a rooftop. Rooftop bars are great, and you can smoke some shisha while drinking at many places. There are several 'baladi bars' downtown which combine belly dancing, Stella, shisha, music, and lots of begging for tips. These are fun to see once, and that's it. Actually, no. Don't go to a baladi bar, they suck.

The average price of a beer that I've paid in Cairo is around 15LE, which right now is about US $2.00. The lower end is 11LE, and the higher end is 24LE, while nicer restaurants will charge 30LE or higher. Don't bother drinking at a hotel bar or casino unless you're willing to pay with your right testicle and firstborn daughter.

There will be cigarrete smoke at every single bar in Cairo. ""No Smoking"" is almost impossible to find, and even less often enforced. Everyone smokes, everywhere. *Elevators* have ash trays.

**In Conclusion**

Here's a [blog post](http://camelsandtacos.blogspot.com/2011/06/egyptian-beer-complete-list.html) I found which offers a little more detailed overviews of Egyptian beers, including some brands I haven't seen yet.

1335289221.0	sq9bu	In Support of Alcohol... 	whiskeyboarder	14	3	1	"For over two years now, I have been what you may describe as a “teetotaler.”


During that period, I have discovered that I have genuinely lost all desire to ever again become drunk. 


That is, however, not to say that I wish never again to drink. In fact, I have recently found that I miss alcohol dearly, for some pretty good (I think) reasons. 


First, the lack of alcohol in my life has had a negative impact on my social activities. Before you assess that statement as a symptom of an alcoholic, allow me a short digression: 


During the past two years, I have encountered on many a day establishments, particularly local bars, taverns, hole-in-the-wall eateries, etc, that I have desired to visit. My choice to abstain from drinking never prevented me from entering these places, but it did shorten most of the visits. After all, I can only graze for so long before I’ll begin to balloon into some sort of caricature of Governor Christie; a consequence I wish to avoid more than any associated with alcohol. 


I imagine that I have matured to the degree that I may now be able to prolong a drink sufficiently to fully appreciate my environment, and the social scene within it. 


Second, I miss greatly the *art of drinking*. There is something intriguing about being able to distinguish and appreciate an India Pale Ale from, say, a Hefeweizen; a Pinot Noir from a Shiraz. Knowledge of alcohol appeals to my very core. I am a guy that once subscribed to Wine Spectator and, with a friend, during college, kept a long running review of beer varieties. 


And, of course, none of this is to overlook the fundamental fact that I enjoy the taste of many alcoholic drinks – the above-mentioned I.P.A. being a personal favorite. 


Finally, I long for the positive effects that alcohol has on my writing. I am unsure if alcohol produced better quality of writing, but I am certain that I enjoyed writing more while drinking. And the link between alcohol and authoring is long and distinguished (see Hemingway and Thompson…) 


I began abstaining from drinking two years ago, about the same time as I relocated to Washington, D.C. That was certainly a transitional period in my life. 


I am now about to transition again – from Washington, D.C. to historic Fredericksburg, Virginia. While doing so, I think I will allow alcohol, in moderation, to reenter my life. 


I look forward to moving to Fredericksburg and socially embedding myself in the community in ways that I have not in D.C. I would like to have a regular watering hole, and friendly ties with those that frequent it. I look forward to making the most of Happy Hour networking. 

All of this may be written as if from the mind of a true alcoholic. You are a better judge than I. As this outlook’s owner, I may be in the worst position to assess. (Needless to say, it seems reasonable to me.) 


The bottom line is that I am financially stable in such a way that I should be really enjoying life. And perhaps I have not been doing so as much as I have let on. But I intend to change that ... in responsible, moderate ways.

My mom managed a liqour store for several years, so she had a HUGE mini bottle collection. Various types of booze and various brands.
Well i got into those when i went through a little phase at 18. I would drink it straight from the bottle, and hold it under my toungue, and then wash it down with soda or something.
So ive had, scotch, brandy, sambuca, flavored vodka, rum, etc etc. 

Fast forward. Im 20 now, i only drink on weekends, and a very rare weeknight if i have a terrible day at work.
Lately ive just been getting a pint of jim beam, now some nights, i can knock it back like its water. Other nights... I cant even get it past my toungue without trouble. Then when it hits my stomach, it burns there and starts up some heartburn. Which has been the case lately. 
Other than jim beam, ill get jagermeister if i can afford it(i enjoy me some jager.) 
Well now lets get to my question. 

Whats a good booze for drinking straight? Like shots and swigs. 
If i could afford it, id get patron or something like that, but being on minimum wage, i cant afford more than 10 bucks a pint. Lol
I used to drink rum mostly, and im thinking about going back to that, but i like to get HAMMERED on the weekend. And it takes like a pint and a half of rum to get me hammered, and i dont like drinking that much if i dont have to(which is why i switched over to bourbon.)
So as a side question, whats a good whiskey? One that i enjoyed(from my moms mini collection. Lol.) was chivas regal, which im sure is out of my pricing range. Lol.


TL;DR what is a good alcohol to drink straight, and get hammered from. And what is a good type of whiskey for drinking straight."	t5_2qi6q	True

1349824371.0	117y2x	Cocktail Card - Las Vegas Edition (X-post from cocktails)	ahoyjmai	12	2	7	"A lot of my friends are still just getting out of college and are still very interested in the whole ""go to Las Vegas and try all the booze"" phase of their lives.

I tried to mock up a ""drinks"" card-- something that would fit on an index card that lists 80 or so popular/famous cocktails (adorned with a little checkbox next to each drink so you can mark your accomplishments). That way, when the waitresses serve you cocktails at the blackjack tables, you'll always have something new and fun to try.

However, I don't really know that much about cocktails in general. The point of the card is to have fun and allow people to explore many different kinds of cocktails in an attempt to find out what is ""their drink.""

I made it initially using cocktails I had heard on personal experience, but I figured that's too limiting. I then made a version based on all the cocktails on the IBA standard cocktails list, but apparently the waitresses in Las Vegas haven't heard of many of the lesser known ones on there. And even though I think they're silly for not knowing the drinks, what's important is the user experience... I wanted the cards to be fun and easy to use.

Cork: do I cut an air hole while using cork method? Again, saturation time, and should I 'dry' it out a bit first?

I'll be using a good grade of vodka, apparently cheap vodka doesn't work so well. Also, a seeded 10lb + watermelon. 

Any other (better?) types of alcohol to use? I enjoy vodka and so do others so I'm really leaning to that. Plain vodka or flavored? (aka vanilla)

1oz cucumber vodka

3oz club soda

1 oz cucumber vodka

1 oz bacon vodka (every redditor has that around, right?)

Never submitted anything on Reddit before, but here goes. Forgive me if I break any reddit rules. Also forgive me if this post is a little all-over-the-place...just trying to get some insight.

I do not know how to drink. I am 25 and have been drinking since I was 16. I was in a fraternity in college and was also a US Marine. Both organizations involve a shitload of drinking. 

I have had plenty of practice but for some reason I tend to get shit faced wasted every time I drink. I do not become charming, more personable or more attractive in any way - I just get text book drunk.

A little about me...I am 5 foot 7, but I have been anywhere from 150lbs to 200lbs. I am currently hovering around 165-170. I have had periods of my life where I was very physically active and fit and times where I was extremely lazy and out of shape.

I will drink anything except tequila (taste) or rum (mildly allergic) but favor common light beer and good whiskey.

I used to drink 3-5 nights out of the week but do not do so anymore. However, I may as well, because no matter how much I drink or how often I do it I will black out and do shit I regret. I also get unbelievably bad hangovers. I always have - I cannot remember a single time, after drinking, that I was not hungover.

When I get drunk I am the typical drunk. I get loud, I won't shut up and I'll probably tell some girl I am mildly attracted to that I love her. I have ruined countless opportunities with girls due to me getting trashed and becoming a drunk slob.

I guess I am asking this - am I just a bad drinker?

TL;DR: I have been drinking for ~9 years but I suck at it. I get too drunk all the time, black out a lot and have seriously bad hangovers. Should I just quit or is there some way to get better at drinking?"	t5_2qi6q	True

I remember back when I first started drinking, within 15 minutes of sipping my first beer I would have a wave of euphoria come over me. Not like a great big high or anything, but a general ""nice everythings OK"" relaxing kind of feeling (kind of tough to explain). For about a year I drank around 2 beers each night, and was able to just relax and enjoy that feeling. Listen to some music, or play a video game and just enjoy that euphoria wave.

Somewhere along the line this feeling started to go away. I started drinking more; first around 3-4 beers per night, then it started progressing to 5-6. That went on for about 4-5 years and I rarely went a day without drinking. At that point I started to feel that alcohol could be a problem for me and so I cut back to only drinking on weekends, but that feeling never returned. Now I know part of that is just alcohol tolerance, but it's not like I can't become intoxicated. If I drink 8-10 beer in a night I will still feel pretty drunk, and I still enjoy alcohol as a social lubricant at parties and such. But I have never been able to get back that 1-2 beer euphoric feeling.

I'm not sure if other people know what I mean when I describe that feeling, but I'm wondering if it's possible to get that feeling back. Can I be ""re-sensitized"" to alcohol by giving it up for a certain amount of time, or have I permanently changed my brain chemistry?"	t5_2qi6q	True

I'm hosting a New Years party this year and I want to know what kind of drinks I can mix with what I've got. If there's a non-alcoholic mix I can use, or if I can make something awesome with just one more alcohol, let me know.

List goes like so:

* Cheapo sherry (used it for cooking once)
* Peach Schnapps
* Tequila
* Triple Sec
* Crown Royal
* Fireball
* Generic cheapish Rye
* Raspberry Sourpuss
* Butterscotch Schnapps
* Kaluha

I'm planning on getting a few liqueurs for my boyfriend when I get back to town after Christmas. I asked him if there were any he wanted to try and he said Drambuie and Grand Marnier. I haven't decided whether I want to get him one or both of those, but I'd also like to get something that is new to both of us.

Ones I know he likes are Ty Ku, Disaronno, and Tequila Rose.

I was watching the Britcom [""Chef!""](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NSCU8/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i02) and heard about a miraculous bit of traditional [Jamaican cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine) called a [Guinness Punch](http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/5696) that involved sweetened condensed milk and Nutmeg.

I found several recipes and tried many of them.  Here's how I suggest making it (but YMMV):

**Ingredients:  Egg, Sweetened Condensed Milk, Half-and-Half, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Guinness Stout**

Thoroughly beat an egg.

Add a halfcup or so of half-and-half, a tin of sweetened condensed milk, a teaspoon of nutmeg, a tablespoon of cinnamon, and maybe some cocoa powder or vanilla extract.

Take a healthy swallow from a bottle of Guinness Stout and pour the rest in.  Mix it thoroughly (a blender would be favorite), and either serve immediately or chill it for some time.

This tastes, not surprisingly, like eggnog, but has the complexity that is concomitant with a stout.

I hear if you mix this in a certain way you can kill the aftertaste of Guinness.  I didn't pull it off and don't mind.

Is it good?  Brownie scouts would drink this stuff.  I suggest serving it instead of eggnog at your adult-beverage-friendly holiday party.

*edit:  Half-and-half, beat.

*Later edit:  You can make this more easily just by mixing Guinness Stout with eggnog and adding some seasoning.  ...if you want."	t5_2qi6q	True

Being that I was not yet of age to drink, my parents left my brother and I with a stack of movies while all the adults went out to get sauced. Well, after 3 movies we got bored and picked the lock on the liquor cabinet.

There was one tequila in particular that I remember very fondly, and have not been able to find ANY information on it since. To the best of my memory, it was called ""HQ HOT"", it was a gold citrus tequila of some sort (very tasty), the logo graphic was a charging bull, and it came in a square bottle. Any help on tracking down this mysterious liquor would be greatly appreciated (as in, if you find where I can get some, I'll buy you a bottle). Here's a [quick photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/VQRZG.jpg) of what I remember the bottle looking like.
