1351737653.0	12fri2	State of the Subreddit	qnnplmr	155	13	30	"Hey all! We've had a slew of new subscribers (about 3k in the last 3 months) which is FANTASTIC. Always love to see a post from a brand new user! So first of all, welcome to you all.

Okay, now down to business. While crafting a theme/desktop combination to look just right feels amazing - and we all love those here - the true heroes of this subreddit are those that go digging deep into the code, making new takes on old skins or even creating brand new ones from scratch. That's right, I'm talking about the OC submitters. Original content is, to me, the very best part of this subreddit. So, to further encourage this, we'd like to start bringing recognition towards those that submit OC. This will be in the form of some super-awesome badass flair that will be implemented soon. 

If you have posted OC in the past or post some in the future, send us a mod message with a link to your post within. If we see that it's an original work of yours, we'll give you the flair! Also, importantly: We define OC as either A) a theme that you made from scratch or B) a theme that you modified off of a source enough that it's nearly or totally unrecognizable from the original. If you're doing this option, please credit the original author in the comments, as the framework of the theme can be the hardest part.

PHEW, almost done guys, I swear. One last bit.

The rule in the sidebar that reads 

&gt;Words like ""Simple, Minimal, Clean, First, Attempt, New, Etc."" are BANNED! BE CREATIVE WITH YOUR TITLES. 

hasn't really been enforced lately. That's been my personal choice, and if that's been bugging you, I really apologize. From here on out, if it is a post with some really good, fresh content that violates that rule, I will issue a warning. If it's a post with some basic omnio/enigma skin with nothing unique to offer, I will message the OP of their error and remove the post, allowing them to re-submit.

Okay, that's all from me! Please, ask any questions, leave any opinions, or shower us in compliments. Anything you want. Especially that last one.

With enthusiastic respect towards each and every one of you,

-Qnnplmr

1353180670.0	13d2rc	[RESOURCE] Introducing Rainpad, a program that allows people with no programming experience to create their own Rainmeter applications.	SXHarrasmentPanda	117	12	28	"Over the past few days I've been developing [Rainpad](http://georgebroadhurstdesigns.com/?page_id=315), an application designed with the intention of simplifying the creation process of Rainmeter applications so that anybody who knows how to use a keyboard and mouse can work with Rainmeter.

This is only the first build of Rainpad, and as such it can only be used for creating fairly simple Rainmeters. [This](http://sxpanda.deviantart.com/art/Rainpad-Example-338238898) is an example Rainmeter I created in about 5 minutes through Rainpad.

Future versions will allow for more complex creations, as well as (hopefully) further simplifying the creation process.

You can download it [here](http://georgebroadhurstdesigns.com/?page_id=315), including a PDF tutorial on creating your first Rainmeter application.


Rain pad currently supports:

* CPU
* Memory
* Hard disks
* Time
* Date
* Battery/Power
* Images
* Buttons (as Images)
* Strings
* Bars
* Roundlines

Things that I intend to add for the next build includes network information, weather, drop-down menus and the seemingly popular Windows 8 style panels. If you have anything else you would like me to add, or changes you want with existing features then just let me know in the comments and I will be happy to abide.

I welcome your feedback :)

EDIT: The Rainpad101 PDF was just updated to include a section on using images, as well as how to use them as buttons.

This is not a ban on any particular skin, but simply an exhortation: Go out there! Find skins buried 15 pages deep in deviantart, look at the new and re-updated skins. Better yet, make your own! If you need help in crafting or creating a skin, I'm here to help! Message me freely with specific issues, I love making/editing skins. The greatest thing for this community would be some true OC. 

To be clear, this post signifies no changes in rules or the way that this community will be moderated. Simply a public service announcement to bring the point into the awareness of the whole. Thank you all for your time!

The objective in this contest is to make the most ""User-Friendly"" Interface with a combination of RocketDock, Rainmeter, WindowsUI(MetroUI), [Xpadder](http://www.xpadder.com)  to allow for a seamless mouseless desktop interface. Think of multimedia applications to intergrate as well like [Plex](http://www.plexapp.com)

This is a challenge to the entirety of the subreddit and have already asked mods about it. Use rainmeter in a way some people normally do for creating a unique style of showing date, weather, system information, or just a unique setup for launching applications. 

Now get the creative juices flowing and the controller in your hand for the future of how we interact with our desktops and show your best work!

* [Basic Circle](http://www.deviantart.com/morelikethis/308072207#/d53f21b)

Based around circles, has basic amenities (system monitors, weather, clocks, mail, etc). Very simple. [Sample pic.](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/175/f/5/basic_circles_v1_1_by_unforgivenrevival-d53f21b.jpg)

* [Do I Need A Jacket?](http://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Do-I-Need-a-Jacket-264544648) 

""A simple, straightforward interpretation of the weather."" Shows weather conditions in very simple terms.
[Sample pic](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/294/a/d/do_i_need_a_jacket__by_flyinghyrax-d4di3yg.png)


* [Encoded](http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Encoded-v1-2-3-215992941)

Based around small square boxes that show various sorts of system information. Minimalistic in general, not very big, but very nice if you don't want to fill your screen to the brim.
[Sample pic](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/180/8/d/desktop_decoded_062911_by_lilshizzy-d3kh16q.jpg)



* [Elegance](http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Elegance-1-0-214509019) and [Elegance 2](http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Elegance-2-244373054)

Big letters, straight lines, thin, and, most of all, elegant. [Sample pic](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/214/4/3/rainmeter___elegance_2_by_lilshizzy-d41hrge.jpg)


* [Elementary](http://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Elementary-Rainmeter-1-5-1-244031084)

Plain text, simple info, easy to work with. [Sample pic.](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/275/4/c/elementary_rainmeter_1_5_1_by_flyinghyrax-d41afl8.png)



* [Popup Notifications 2.0](http://manci5.deviantart.com/#/d5hsw6y) 

A simple popup that shows you what music is playing and fades in and out. Works with iTunes, Winamp, Windows Media Player, and foobar2000. [Sample pic](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/287/e/1/popup_notifications_2_0_by_manci5-d5hsw6y.png)

* [SimpleSentenceThree](http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=simple+sentence#/d2ws62q)

Info that would otherwise be in blurbs or numbers tossed about the screen are now sentences casually telling what's what. Besides that, there are a variety of small simple clocks and meters. Comes with configuration tools so you don't have to fiddle with .ini and .txt files. [Sample pic.](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/193/a/6/simplesentencethree_by_white_baron-d2ws62q.png)

* [Straight Skin](http://customize.org/rainmeter/skins/70460)

Looks more eloquent than most other skins on the list. Has the basics (clock, system monitors, music player). [Sample Pic](http://files.customize.org/download/screenshots/70211/74491/Red_Girl_Desktop.jpg)

Input from the community on this is pretty much a necessity if this list is going to be awesome. Suggestions/recommendations are highly appreciated. I know there's more than just this out there. 

When posting a skin recommendation, have a sample picture of what it looks like in use if you have one.

1353447292.0	13j3ke	[RESOURCE] Rainpad v0.2 released! Create complex skins without writing a single line of code.	SXHarrasmentPanda	60	7	14	"[Here it is](http://georgebroadhurstdesigns.com/?page_id=315)

This version allows you to create Windows 8 style panels, drop down menus and image arrays with ease, as well as making some improvements to the existing Rainpad functions. The download also includes a 19 page tutorial document to get you started creating Rainmeter skins without having to learn the code.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/Na55v.png) is a screenshot which shows off some of the new things you can easily create in Rainmeter using Rainpad.

Please try it out and let me know your thoughts on whats good, whats bad, and what you want to see in future versions.

For those interested, here is the changelog:

New features:

* Added Windows 8 panels creation
* Added image array creation
* Added drop down menu creation
* Added a preview window to string meters

Changes:

* Removed the restrictions of using predefined variables so that each meter may use its own color and font values
* All entries now have default values to make Rainpad more intuitive
* You can now choose images using an open file dialog
* Some hints have been added to various windows

Fixes:

* Fixed a bug that prevented users from choosing the colour of a bar for a hard disk
* Fixed a bug that caused hour bars to display incorrectly
