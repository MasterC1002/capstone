I thought something was off when I saw little droplets on my window, but I figured it was probably bird piss, so I shrugged it off and went to take my morning deuce.

I finished up my morning routine, grabbed a piece of toast (buttered) and made my way for the door. I knew something was up because it was a lot darker than normal, but I didn't think anything of it. As I stepped outside however, my worst suspicions were confirmed. It was raining.

Dammit.. It's been so long since it's rained.. and I mean REALLY rained. I've almost forgotten what it was like. I stood in my doorway for a few moments, lost in thought. I started to get angry. Why? Why now? Why today? I fell to my knees, cursed at the sky, and cried out, ""THERE IS NO GOD.""

Then I went inside and got my umbrella.

All in all it's been a truly harrowing experience, and I think I am forever changed. You can ask me anything, but be gentle, as I am still pretty fragile... and wet.

“We won’t need this now.” She trilled lustfully, kissing my labia before tossing the discarded sex toy across the room where it landed with a soft thud. “I’ve got something much better planned for you.” She then pierced my folds with her beak and her tongue began lashing at my inner walls like there was no tomorrow. The sudden feeling of pleasure from the contact made me gasp and moan out loud, earning a giggle and a sly look from Ava. “You like that, don’t you?” she teased. “Well, you’re about to love this.” Ava went back to eating me out as her expert tongue found every nook and cranny she could reach and explored them thoroughly in her quest to make me cum and if she kept this up, that wouldn’t take long. I thought it couldn’t get any better until my avian lover proved me wrong by using her feathered wingtips to play with the sensitive pink nub that rested at the top of my slit. This new stimulation from the flying-type increased the pleasure I felt tenfold and if you’ve ever felt feathers on your clit, you’d agree. "	t5_2sff7	True

My name is Serious Block and I am a dissident and ex-prisoner of conscience from Azkabanz. In 2009 I posted a video that mocked the ridiculous overspending (purchasing Crookshanks from Slitherin at USD 40,000 each) by the Government of Azkabanz. Two weeks later, my friend and I were attacked and severely beaten up by Munchingkillers while dining in one of the local schnazzbars. We went and complained about the event to the Rowdy Crowd Control. Eventually the thugs were let go, my friend and I were arrested on trumped up charges of excessive frockling and causing massive consumption of hallucinagins. We spent 17 months in jail. The case caused wire international outcry, eventually Harry Potter and Beatrix Kiddo spoke on our behalf and we were freed on parole. 

I have been lurking here for a while, decided that the first post should be an AMA about myself. Hope this will be intradasting.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Reddit (stylized as reddit; pronounced /ˈrɛdɪt/) is a social news website where the registered users submit content, in the form of either a link or a text ""self"" post. Other users then vote the submission ""up"" or ""down,"" which is used to rank the post and determine its position on the site's pages and front page.
Reddit was originally founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. It was acquired by Condé Nast Publications in October 2006. In September 2011, Reddit was split from Condé Nast, and now operates as a subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications."	t5_2sff7	True

I always have stocked grocery stuff. Today out of the fucking blue they assigned me to Housewares and Appliances (basically all the shit you put in your kitchen including coffee machines and blenders). Because it was my last day, and this was a completely unfamiliar area to me, I knew I wasn't going to get too much done. I ended up adopting a sort of ""ah fuck it"" attitude. 

I didn't slack off or anything but I definitely moved at a leisurly pace and took any legitimate opportunity to go do something else (for instance collecting all of the empty pallets at the end of the day for everyone nearby).

Luckily I got to keep my box cutter. Yeah its only a box cutter, but its a good one at that. With that said the best thing about today was having a lot of my coworkers tell me how they really appreciated the work that I did alongside them. This includes my manager who is helping me transfer to another Walmart (not as a stocker anymore).
