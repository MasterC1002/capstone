1352052526.0	12mcrj	As an atheist, it bugs me when other atheists think that there is nothing to be learned from religion.	silveraw	177	36	152	"An example is the image that gets posted saying to the effect, ""God can't be all loving if he would torture you for eternity for simply being unconvinced.""

It really bugs me that people just hop onto the bandwagon without giving it a second thought.  If you actually look at the concept of heaven and hell, there is a lot to be learned from it.  The idea being that God is love, and hell is the separation from God, therefore being a separation from love.  Looking at the simple theology behind it gives you that much more insight to it.  I think most everyone can agree that if you separate yourself from love, you are going to have a bad time.

Just a pet peeve of mine, that I am sure others in this reddit can relate to.  The hatred of religion shown by many people demonstrates a lack of understanding about it.  I mean, how many people go around saying, ""~~Buddhism~~The Iroquois says the world is on a turtles back, we have pics to prove it isn't. Checkmate ~~buddhists~~Natives American Religion!""  Obviously in this example the Iroquois religion is using imagery to demonstrate a point about our relationship with the earth.

We hear so much in the news about loudmouths that scream bigotry, intolerance, and racism and claim they represent Christianity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Here is a good example of how true Christianity is.  Note that there is no press release or nationwide media coverage of things like this, which is one reason why people get such a bad view of religion.
&gt;Dear Church Family,
 
&gt;Several months ago, a certain unnamed pastor here in the city spoke out
&gt;publicly in a derogatory fashion about the Islam faith and its adherents.  As
&gt;the Pastor of Dallas' oldest deeded and dedicated Christian church, I took
&gt;the opportunity to call the Imam at Dallas' oldest mosque to apologize and
&gt;express that not all Christians hold the opinion of that pastor and promised
&gt;to work with him toward understanding and peace.
&gt; 
&gt;Last night Suzanne and I were invited by Imam Khalid Shaheed and his wife
&gt;Bettie to attend an interfaith Ramadan Iftar banquet at the mosque in Richardson.
&gt;It was a wonderful experience!  What struck me the most was that we were
&gt;Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu Americans all sitting down at the
&gt;tables together, breaking bread together in peace and respect.  It truly felt
&gt;as though we were one nation under God.
&gt; 
&gt;The United Methodist Church was very well represented by clergy and lay
&gt;persons from various churches around the metroplex.  It was a real honor
&gt;to sit at a table with the Imam and his wife, the executive Director of Jewish
&gt;Community Relations and a representative of the Roman Catholic diocese.
&gt;Suzanne and I were very proud to represent Cochran Chapel and we look
&gt;forward to continued good relations with the Imam and his wife.
&gt; 
&gt;Jesus has certainly set the example for us as Christians willing to sit at
&gt;table and break bread together in unity and peace.  Last night for two hours,
&gt;persons of many different faith expressions did just that, broke bread together
&gt;in unity and peace and respect.  And, I believe, God was pleased indeed.
&gt; 
&gt;Peace and grace to you,
&gt;Pastor Joe

I don't like getting handed pamphlets or preached to either, but I always feel like the person is trying to help me, and is just misguided.  I do not understand why someone would hate the person or get nasty over it just because you believe something different.  I guess religious intolerance is just as popular in r/atheism.

Salutations, my fellow redditor!

I write this letter to you with good will and in the hope next year we improve our relations. Like it or not, we are going to stumble upon the others' postings and stoke the passion that fuels the internet. Before we jump back into our trenches, I've got some goals for myself I'd like to share with you.

**I respect your passion.** We're going to butt heads and I'm ok with you getting angry with me. Heck, you can even pray for me or at me. I don't mind.

**I will give you the benefit of the doubt.** If you can give me convincing arguments about your position, I'll respect them. I am, however, the judge of what convinces me, what changes my point of view, and I'll explain my reasons.

**I will try my best to be civil.** We've been on the internet long enough to know that anonymity creates brave cowards. I'm not going to deny I'm going to get pissed from time to time. If I cross the line, I ask you point it out that I'm being a jerk.

**I will do my best to use facts.** In our passion to prove each other wrong, we're going to have to agree on something. While you and I may widely diverge on origins (the ""why"" something happened), we should be able to respect a wide range of facts and the basis on which those facts are derived. I will do my best to link to sites explaining those facts.

And finally,

**I respect your right to practice your religion.** The separation of church and state means a lot to me, and as long as you and every other person can practice as they freely and choose without coercion, I'm ok with it. And while I may not like your religion or your religious nature, I can agree you have a right to it and I can support your right to it.

Thanks for reading, happy New Years, and may your religion bring you enlightenment, peace and joy throughout the year!

Your Atheist redditor,

-HeresyBob

This reaction often draws criticism from the overly zealous Politically-Correct loving fanatics who can't sympathize with the sentiment. They will say things like, ""its about the victims right now, don't you have sympathy instead of being selfish...""

Here is where the phrase ""please don't be Muslim"" is lost upon many. The tragedy (Newtown, Aurora theatre, Boston Marathon) already occurred and the innocent lives have been lost and nothing we can do can bring them back and its heart breaking. The ""please don't be Muslim"" phrase already includes these presumptions. The phrase ""please don't be Muslim"" is a prayer/hope that the killers/perpetrators not be Muslim so that millions of Muslims in the West not be harassed, detained, assaulted etc. and innocent children and civilians in (Insert possible Middle Eastern country) not have their lives turned upside down and/or be killed as a reaction to the individual terrorist's atrocity. 

These are not far-fetched delusions but experiential knowledge of the Muslim Ummah over the last 12 years. No one is going to hold candle-light vigils for the drone-killed innocent children and civilians in whatever country the hypothetical terrorist might be from, nor is anyone going to be affected as countless Muslims in the West feel their lives and identity under a microscope. So please save your Politically-Correct BS and let me have the under my breath prayer/hope of ""please don't be Muslim"". 

May God grant patience to the families of the victims and grant the victims a speedy recovery. May God also prevent any fitna/trials to come upon the Ummah through this tragic event."	t5_2qh39	True

\- They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners.

1373180871.0	1hsjob	A dear friend of mine volunteered at a church to feed the homeless, and was asked to leave because she was Muslim. I think she handled it beautifully.	soapywaterandbubbles	65	13	24	"This his HER story, not mine.  She posted it on FB and I am changing names of the church and the person who asked her to leave.  I just wanted to see what anyone thought of her experience.  

""Today I went to First Baptist Church of _________ to volunteer. They were having a feed the homeless event and I signed up to help as a student from Iota Kappa Chi which is the nursing club at ________ College. After serving food to several people, the person in charge, a woman named 'Linda', came up to me and told me she had to ask me to leave and that I am not allowed to help out. I asked 'why not?' And she says because they are a Christian church and therefore cant allow ""someone like me"" to be there and help out. I told her it was not as if I was imposing my beliefs on anyone, I just wanted to help feed the homeless but she wouldn't have it. I was completely speechless and did not know what to since I haven't dealt with such Islamophobia especially being completely alone and not knowing anyone at the church. So with tears in my eyes, I went outside and headed towards my car. 

I was going to leave but then I realized I did not have to accept being treated with such intolerance from anyone. Who was that lady to tell me to leave just because I'm a Muslim. So I wipe away my tears and walked back into the church. I asked another lady who was in charge and she pointed to 'Linda', the lady who kicked me out. So Linda comes over and I asked her why wasn't I allowed to help. She just repeated what she said previously. I asked how do she know any of the other students from ______ were Christian? How did she know they weren't atheist or something? That's when she revealed her true reason for kicking me out. She said ""if you were dressed in normal street clothes, we wouldn't have a problem with you but we can't have here dressed like that."" I said ""but these are my normal street clothes. This is how I dress everyday. It is a part of my beliefs."" She kicked me out because I looked like a Muslim. She then said ""well your beliefs are completely different than ours."" At this point I realized how ignorant of Islam Linda really was. I told her our religions were really similar, that we both believe in God and Jesus. She then said the most ignorant thing ever. She said ""No, the Jesus and God you believe in are different than the ones we believe in."" I told her If someone wanted to help Jesus with something, I'm sure he wouldn't reject them just because they not christian. She agreed but still wouldn't let me help. I realized how ignorant she was of her own religion so I couldn't blame her for being ignorant of Islam. So I told her I wanted speak to whoever was in charge of the church. She told me the pastor was in charge but he wasn't there today so I asked for his contact information. She went and got me the church's business card and I left.

It is 2013 and I live in Southern California which is one of the most diverse places in the US so I never thought I would the be recipient of such tolerance, especially from people who claim to be followers of Prophet Jesus. I don't care if a place does have a right to kick out anyone. I would have gladly left if I was being disruptive or disrespectful but I was simply kicked out because I wear a hijab (headscarf). After controlling my emotions, I realized this is an education opportunity. May Allah is testing me to see how i react. How I handle this situation. I can't sit back and have people be ignorant and intolerant of Muslims for no apparent reason. I thought about what I should do. I visited the church's website and since tomorrow is Sunday, they will be having a service. I am going to go there and see if I can talk to the pastor. If the pastor can make things right then Alhamdulillah, but if not then further action will be taken. I'm writing this experience just to make everyone aware of how intolerant people are even though we are in 2013. Experiences like these just make me proud to be a Muslim and make me stronger because it motivates me to stand up for what's right. I make dua that Allah makes something positive come out of this."""	t5_2qh39	True

So I posted **[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/eito5/if_every_member_of_rchristianity_donates_just_445/)** thread.

Inevitably, one of the folks over on r/atheism posted **[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/eix3p/ok_battle_stations_everybody_tonight_we_show/)** one.

The atheists (probably because there are so many more of them!) moved much more quickly a got a group fundraising page for Doctors Without Borders set up in no time! 

The air of competitiveness that sprung up around this idea is bothering both Christians and atheists alike, and I thought it would be great if theists and atheists on reddit could set aside their differences for a while to do something good for the world. So I donated. And in the comments section, I wrote ""reddit.com/r/religion.""

I know that almost everyone here has had at least one truly genuine &amp; productive conversation with an atheist about the nature of the universe, and I think many of them would say the same.

I'll start by saying that Quakers typically have a large diversity of beliefs, so you could be getting 4 different answers from 4 different people here. 

I'm relatively new to Quakerism, so I'll reserve the right to say I don't know or I'll get back to you later on any questions I don't know the answer to. I'll do my best to be on Reddit periodically throughout the day to answer all your questions. 

Quakers typically hold beliefs on Pacifism, and the Inner Light of God inside everyone. Typically Quakers reject the Bible as the 'word of god' but still seeing it as a very important book, and reject clergy. Quakers also have strong emphasis on social justice. Finally, we have very unique worship services, typically held in silence. 

Here's some resources if you want to look further into the Society of Friends:

By: David Mc

David Mc:  Could you tell me your full name please?

Fred Phelps Jr.:  Fred Phelps Jr...which, by the way, if you Google it... you know the swimmer Michael?

D.M.:  I'm sorry?

F.P.:  You know the swimmer Michael Phelps?

D.M.:  Yes

F.P.:  If you Google his name, his name is Michael Fred Phelps Jr.

D.M.:  [chuckle] Oh is that right?

F.P.:  Isn't that interesting?

D.M.:  [chuckle] OK, I have about 9 questions here to ask you and if that’s too many just let me know and I will not ask all of them. And if you would prefer not to answer a specific question please feel free to do so.  First off, what is your definition of love?

F.P.:  Oh...truth.

D.M.:  Proof?

F.P.:  No.  Truth.  

D.M.:  Oh, would you care to elaborate on that or are you going to leave it at that?

F.P.:  Well, in the context of our experiences, the Bible says the first commandment is to love your neighbor and that is to tell them the truth about what is going on.  Not...uh...when we go up against the very places we do all these counter protests their definition of love appears to be gushy, mushy, meaningless crap or all those fag parades...their definition of love is lust.  Physical lust.  

D.M.:  Uh-huh

F.P.:  The Bible's definition clearly says so is...telling your neighbor the truth.  Warning them that their sin is taking them to hell.  And that's proof.  And that's love.

D.M.:  Ok, second question is do you believe there are different levels of sin?

F.P.:  ...Yes

D.M.:  Could you elaborate please

F.P.:  Well, obviously stealing a candy bar is different from homosexual sex and--

D.M.:  --but do you believe there is a different punishment for these different levels?

F.P.:  Absolutely, I think the Bible clearly talks about different degrees of punishment and there's never been...the only example of sin in the Bible that has destroyed a nation is sodomy....Sodom and Gomorrah...Are you still there?

D.M.:  Yes, I am.

F.P.:  Sodom and Gomorrah was physically destroyed. If you believe what the Bible says, fire and brimstone completely wiped it off the planet.  And their sin was surrounding Lot's house, sodomites surrounding their house wishing, commanding that they have homosexual sex with the 
angels that were in his house and that's grievous... that’s a sin the Bible calls abomination.

D.M.:  OK.  If you could define salvation, how would you define it?

F.P.:  Rescuing..uh..a sinner from his eternal damnation...

D.M.:  ...OK.  How important was Jesus's ministry on earth in your opinion?

F.P.:  Well, I think without that, without the ultimate sacrifice...crucifixion...there would not be any hope for the  human race so obviously its important.

D.M.:  Yes, sir.  OK, what is the most important thing for a christian to accomplish?

F.P.:  Well, what Christ said, his last words to his disciples was to go on and preach...

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  And feed my children, feed my lands, feed my sheep.

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  And that's not talking about physically feeding...I mean it could include that, but it means providing them with physical food and sustenance so those two things would be near the top, if not at the top of the list.  Preaching to the world and providing for their children.

D.M.:  OK.  If..I'm not sure if you’re familiar with the verse, but what does John 3:17 mean to you?

F.P.:  Well, I don't have my bible right in front of me...

D.M.:  OK

F.P.:  But, obviously its right after John 3:16, which is one of the most misused verses of the bible on the planet--

D.M.:  --Well, i have the verse in front of me if you'd like me to read it to you.  I did type it out--

F.P.:  --Sure.

D.M.:  It is “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”

F.P.:  ...Yeah, and then the next verse...read the next verse.

D.M.:  Well, I don’t have the verse available to me right here--

F.P.:  OK, well the gist is here, it also talks about 16 itself or 18...if you don’t believe on him, you're not going to be saved. I don't remember the exact lines...whoever believes on him will be saved.  “The world” is used in many different ways throughout the Bible.  It refers to the earthly geographical, sometimes it refers to the gentiles as opposed to the Jewish world, it..at no time does it include every single human being really...if...they included that at time in the front cause even then it didn’t include every human being.  It's misused.  It's clearly not every human being that...God did not come to love every human being or every human being would be in heaven. His love is impotent...his salvation is impotent if he has to rely on some week sinful humans to accept it.

D.M.:  OK.  Yes, as I'm saying...I'm writing this research paper on the Westboro Baptist Church's interpretation of the Bible and, in my searching, I came across the Five points of Calvinism and that seems a lot like one of the five points.

F.P.:  Uhh...whats one of the five points?

D.M.:  Well, you're mentioning the world and how it talks about the man of spirit within the world of flesh and--

F.P.:  --Yeah, the closest it would come with the five points is limited atonement.  The atonement is limited.  It's not for every single human being.  Did Hitler go to heaven?

D.M.:  I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.:  Did Osama Bin Laden go to heaven?

D.M.:  I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.:  Did Christ die for him? Did he send his son that Osama Bin Laden might be saved?

D.M.:  I don’t know, sir.

F.P.:  Did Adolph Hitler or the tyrants and murders...Stalin?  We have dealt with this in great detail on our website. There is a special paper called the “John 3:16 Lie”.  We’ve gone into great academic detail cause that verse is so fragrantly and sadistically misused.  If the students in our colleges, such as yourself, treated other scholarly works the way they treat superficially John 3:16, they would flunk 
out of school so I would refer you to that paper that’s there on the website, the “John 3:16 Lie”, i think that’s what its called.

D.M.:  OK.  Is there any place for repentance for homosexuals?

F.P.:  You know...uh...we've certainly been asked that many times over the years. there’s two passages in the bible that pretty well convince me the answer is “no”, although I would never say 100 percent cause there’s another verse that suggest that some of the numbers of...I forget what church it was...might have been church Galatia where Paul writes...says some...if days go by some of its views on mankind a reference to homosexuality and all like it.. and now they read it at the church but i think the answers probably “no” and I say that because, in Romans Chapter 1, where three different times describing homosexuals...god has given them up. You can't come to repent that so God has 
given you up and then the other passage would be, I believe revelations chapter 22:15, where there’s a list...5 or 6 types of humans who will never go to heaven...and the first on that list is dogs, and dogs is the Bible's metaphor for homosexuals.

D.M.:  We're very close to being finished here.  So this is kind of branching off of that question. Is it the church's opinion that it is entirely a choice to be homosexual?  [crosstalk]  Now I'm not asking about performing homosexual acts...I'm asking about, within your heart and mind, does 
your church believe it is a choice to be a homosexual?

D.M.:  Well, it's our belief that that is a condition that god has placed that person in. just like Pharaoh's heart. You know, the old story of Pharaoh and Moses. It's a condition that he places them in. It's part of his judgment of that human because they rejected...again, Roman Chapter 1 describes this in great detail. They rejected, refused to acknowledge him as God.

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  You know, you kind of remind me of my son a little bit; he says ""uh-huh"" a lot like you do.

D.M.:  [chuckle] Oh, well--

F.P.:  --How old are you?

D.M.:  I am 26, sir.

F.P.:  Well, he's 37 so he's a little older but he does have that as well.  So you're only 26? Where are you going to school?

D.M.:  I'm going to school at..uh..its a community college in New Bern, North Carolina.

F.P.:  OK, well i hope you have a good experience there, I hope your efforts are successful.

D.M.:  Well, yes. I hope so too, sir.  I just do have two last questions for you.  It seems like your church elevates homosexuality above tax cheaters, adulterers, and murderers.  I'm not sure if you would interpret this as true, but could you comment on that?

F.P.:  ...Whats that again? Tax cheaters?

D.M.:  Well, tax cheaters, adulterers, murderers...

F.P.:  ...Well, I would say to you, I would say two things, there. First thing is we do indeed preach to...uh...we have signs that say “Divorce = Adultery” and we have signs about abortion, which certainly is the main fashion of killing in this nation anymore. Tens of thousands of babies killed every year so we do indeed press those issues but that leads me to my second point I would make on this 
is...we don’t control the media.  The media has been pushing this fag filth for several decades.  They are the ones who have pushed this onto the front pages of the nation's newspapers and the lead stories on the 6 o’clock news and the national news...this homosexual relentless **** beatings that’s bound resulting in same sex marriage across the nation so that’s the part of our ministry that seems to get most of the media attention as that’s part of their agenda. So that would be my second major point. 

D.M.:  OK, well i have just one final question for you, sir. I'm aware from my research that the Westboro Baptist Church is comprised mostly of family members, immediate and distant...uh...children and adults alike, this is correct, right?

F.P.:  Well, i don't know what the percentage is, but there are a lot of people in our church that are related, marriage or otherwise.

D.M.:  Alright, well, suppose that one of the children ,who are under the age of 18,...essentially...came out and announced they were homosexual.  What would be the church's opinion on...the decidings[sic] of the individual?

F.P.:  Well, we don’t...first of all, that has not happened and we would not expect that to happen in the true church of the lord Jesus Christ...if you're talking about if they were a member--

D.M.:  Well, essentially, Mr. Phelps, I'm trying to find--[crosstalk]

F.P.:  If they were not a member, if they're just...you know..i mean...a child of one of the church members...there wouldn’t be any different reaction. we've had people leave this church for all kinds of reasons, they obviously would not be comfortable here...

D.M.:  What I'm really trying to find out with this question is...you know..obviously this child would not be able to legally leave...or become emancipated.  I'm trying to find if the church would..i mean..place the child up for adoption? Or if the church would--

F.P.:  --[chuckle] No, our job is to preach and that’s what we would continue to do to him or her or anyone else who is in the hearing of our voices.

D.M.:  Well, its just...I'm sorry I'm not putting it quite as eloquently as it is in my head.  All these members..the several that have left the church, they’ve all done on there own volition, but I'm trying to find out if someone in the church wasn’t “up” with someone else in the church, in this case a child, would this child have to leave?

F.P.:  No, our responsibility is to raise our children and that’s what we do.

D.M.:  Well, I think that’s all of my questions, Mr. Phelps.  At the end of this, I'd like to say if you're not too busy, if you have anything you'd like to add...I mean, the floor is entirely open to you. As I said, I will be transcribing this and I will be presenting this to the classroom so...eyes will be seeing this so if there's anything you'd like to add please feel free to say anything you like.

F.P.:  Well, of course I don't know what your topic is on per se'.

D.M.:  Well, we were instructed to write on the Bibles influence on western culture and I specified by choosing the Westboro Baptist Church and I'm writing essentially about the five points of Calvinism.

F.P.:  Right, OK, well I think its fairly well known who we are and what we're about. It's not rocket science. The Bible...we believe the error free word of God...that’s life and hope for the human race and that’s what we preach and have believed and preached since 1955, that’s “one-nine-five-five”, and...you know I've appreciated the opportunity to respond to your questions and I hope it helps you and anyone else who hears it

D.M.:  Yes sir, you certainly did and I'm very glad I got this opportunity as well.

F.P.:  OK, well you have a nice day out there and we'll talk to you later or not... but thanks for calling.

D.M.:  Thank you very much, Mr. Phelps.

F.P.:  OK, bye.

D.M.:  Bye.

I will answer any questions.		57	13	70	"I grew up Catholic and decided I was an atheist shortly before leaving for college. That didn't work for me too well so I kind of adopted a more spiritual approach, especially after taking a class on Buddhism.

Two years later, as a drop-out, I found my way into Scientology. My life was a complete wreck. Due to my lack of upbringing, I lacked a lot of basic adult skills. After one Scientology class, I was amazed at how well presented such novel, and yet useful, concepts of life were being displayed... ready to be picked up and used.

I quickly went aboard as a staff member and was fully immersed for about 1 1/2 years. Eventually, problems with my college debts forced me back into civilian life. The tools I learned did help me bootstrap myself and start a new life.

Within a few years, I was able to pay off about $10k of debt from the services I received as staff and continue with my Scientology services as a lay person. 

Over the next decade or so, I did as much Scientology as I could and hold down a full-time job. I also streched all my accounts and assets to the limit to 1) make donations that served the church's causes and 2) pay for my own services, both in taking courses and receiving Scientology therapy.

Eventually, I found myself getting tired of going into the church and feeling like I had a $ on my forehead with an arrow to my wallet. I spent about a year and a half slowly backing off before formally ending things in a private manner.

My life has been 'interesting' since... not in the way you might suspect. I have had to come to terms with my own lack of spiritual identity, do a lot of soul searching, shrug off a lot of lies and relook at the world; amidst my own emotional battles.

Anyways, ask me anything and I will be at least as truthful with you as I am with myself.

**Edit:**  Thanks for the Reddit Gold, Mr. Anonymous - knocked my socks off.  Now, I need to go figure out what it does.  :-)

**Edit #2:**  One thing has solidified with me on this review of my past experience.  The biggest fault I have with Scientology is that it takes itself too seriously.  One man had to do it all.  One church has to maintain a monopoly on the entire body of research and forces you to accept all or none or be accused of perverting it.  Eventually, we should see the church loose power and funds and disappate.  Hopefully after 200 years of forgetting how much everyone used to hate it, people might start looking at it again and incorporating what is needed at that time."	t5_2qh39	True

(Written for the People's National Party—P. N. P.-of Jamaica, 1965)
By Bertell Ollman

Is this true? Listen to the words of Jesus and decide for yourselves whether Socialism is Practical Christianity.

SOCIALISM MEANS BROTHERHOOD:

    ""all ye are brethren."" (Matthew""23;8)

    ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.""(Matthew: 22; 39)

    ""All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."" (Matthew: 7; 12)

    ""Let everyone who possesses two shirts share with him who has none, and let him who has food do likewise."" (Luke: 3; 11)

    ""Give to every man that asketh of thee."" (Luke: 6; 30) 


SOCIALISM MEANS JUSTICE:

    ""Give and it shall be given unto you...for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."" (Luke: 6; 38) 

SOCIALISM MEANS BEING FOR POOR PEOPLE AND AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS:

    ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...to preach deliverance to the captives."" (Luke: 4; 18) 

SOCIALISM MEANS OPPOSITION TO THE GREEDY RICH:

    ""Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.""(Luke: 6; 24).

    ""No man can serve two masters…Ye cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew: 6; 24)

    ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.""(Matthew: 19; 23) 

SOCIALISM MEANS CHRISTIAN CONCERN FOR SOCIAL PROBLEMS:

Jesus' life, as well as his teachings, was a model of concern for his fellow human beings. Though poor in material things, he and his disciples shared what they had with all about them. For centuries afterwards, those who called themselves Christians were most noteworthy for the cooperative fellowship that characterized the community in which Jesus lived. For these men, Christianity was a matter of making over their lives to bring the greatest good to mankind. So, too, for many of the early Christian missionaries who came to Jamaica. It was Churchmen like Knibb, Burchell and Sharpe who fought the planters and got slavery abolished. Land settlement to provide land for the freed slaves and public education for the children of the poor also came about through the efforts of these true Christians. George Williams Gordon and Bogle of St. Thomas were Churchmen who were willing to suffer martyrdom to improve the conditions of the people.
SOCIALISM MEANS THE SOLUTION:

Then, as now, it was not possible to love God without loving one's fellow man, and putting this love into practice. In the modern period, unemployment and its accompanying ills have replaced slavery as the principal evil. Today in Jamaica no true Christian can remain indifferent while hundreds of thousands of his countrymen are ill-fed, badly housed, illiterate, and without proper medical care. Pained by the sight of so much suffering, many high minded Christians have turned to socialism as the solution.
SOCIALISM MEANS AN END TO CAPITALIST INJUSTICE:

Capitalism, the system under which we are now living, may be described as a way of life in which, ""One soweth, and another reapeth""(John: 4; 37). Well might we say to the wealthy few who own our large estates and factories what Jesus said to his disciples: ""you…reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor""(John: 4; 38). The capitalists cease from resting only to eat, while you cease from working only to rest, and eat only when you can. Do you believe that Jesus favored such injustice, he who said, ""by their fruits ye shall know them""(Mathew: 7; 20)? The fruits of capitalism in Jamaica can be seen even by the blind; they are poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, crime, greed, and disease. Could the kind and loving Jesus have wanted us to live like this?
SOCIALISM MEANS LIVING THE GOLDEN RULE:

Socialism is the exact opposite of capitalism. In socialism, every man carries an equal burden of work and shares equally in the good things that society has to offer. There is no poverty, because all the idle land and machines have been put to use to produce the things people want. Production is aimed at satisfying the needs of the masses rather than the profit interest of a few. There is no unemployment, because a plan has been created to put everyone to work. Illiteracy is soon abolished, and the diseases that plague people are reduced to the few for which advanced medicine has not found a cure. Each individual is given the chance of developing himself to the fullest, with everyone helping him in whatever way they can. The Golden Rule—""as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise""(Luke: 6; 31)—has become the rule which all men follow in their daily lives.
SOCIALISM MEANS THE PEOPLE OWN THEIR COUNTRY:

The journey to socialism is long and hard; but Jesus never said Christianity was easy. The road to socialism passes by way of public ownership of large estates and factories, that is the replacement of private capitalists by the workers, the consumers, the local community, or the national Government. In this way people will own their places of work, either directly or through some body duly elected to represent them. If a man works on his own as a farmer or craftsman, he will continue to do so or become a member of a local cooperative. The choice is his, and, no matter what he chooses, socialism will bring him outstanding benefits in the way of a fair price for his products, security during ill health and old age, greatly improved educational, medical, recreational, and cultural facilities, and much else. Those who work for large firms and estates, on the other hand, will become the common owners of their enterprises. Throughout, cooperation, the brotherhood called for in Christ's teachings, is at the center of socialism, and it will be encouraged in all walks of life and by every possible means.
SOCIALISM DOES NOT MEAN WHAT ITS ENEMIES SAYS IT DOES:

There are a few rich people in Jamaica who hate socialism, because it would take away their special privileges and make them our equals. These selfish men, who own the press and the radio, try to scare people by telling them lies about socialism. These are the ""false prophets"" of our day. Jesus, too, had put up with many lies told by those who disliked his teachings. Here are some of the worst lies you are likely to hear about socialism. Don't you be fooled.

It is a LIE that socialism is against Christianity. How can it be when socialism is Christianity put into practice? It is a LIE that people cannot worship freely in socialism. It is a LIE that socialism means cutting your goat or house in two and giving half to the government. It is a LIE that socialism means that the small farmer will have his land taken away from him. It is a LIE that socialism will make us all prisoners of the Russians or the Chinese or the Cubans. What nonsense, yet our capitalists are counting on you to believe it.
SOCIALISM IS COMING—WITH YOUR HELP:

If, indeed, SOCIALISM IS PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY, it is the duty of every Christian to help bring it about as quickly as possible. Keep in mind—all that is needed to win a victory for EQUALITY and BROTHERHOOD is for enough of you, the people of Jamaica, to want it and to will it. In politics, as in religious matters, we have much to learn from Jesus' words:

    ""Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you""(Mathew: 7; 7).

So, a survey recently popped up in a couple of subreddits on the subject of religion but people weren't too happy with the questions. I've attempted to compose a more versatile and inclusive survey.
This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.
Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Survey Link: http://www.screator.net/showform.php?f=620542889

A full list of the subreddits being surveyed follows: r/Christianity, r/Atheism, r/Buddhism, r/Hinduism, r/Islam, r/Pagan, r/Judaism, r/TrueAtheism, r/Agnosticism, r/Deism, r/NeoPagan, r/Satanism, r/Scientology, r/Humanism, r/Taoism, r/Shinto, r/UUreddit, r/Pantheism, r/DebateReligion, r/ExploreReligion, r/Catholicism, r/NewAge.
If you have any subreddit suggestions, please comment! I'll probably post it there as well. The survey ends Sunday, July 22, 2012.
Also, it may take a little while for me to get ALL of these topics up. There is a wait between submissions. But they'll all be up tonight.

Note: I am posting this on behalf of [Ragnaramble](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Ragnaramble), who is pretty overwhelmed with managing all the posts in different subreddits and asked for help with the ones he missed.

I've never actually spoke with God, all these miracles seem like optimism and luck playing its part in life. It's just seemed like I've been wasting my life holding myself back from experimenting the world, spending 5 days a week at church.
**Lately**: I've been feeling like there is most definitely a superior being out there, that could be both the good and the bad, something similar to Karma where what you do affects your future. I was doing research on how when you die your brain releases a natural-occuring drug abbreviated DMT, which is a super-psychadelic said to be heaven sent. DMT is also cycled while you sleep and is believed to cause the psychadelic dreams you have whilst asleep, and also why it's so surreal. I thought that since your brain releases so much of it right at the time of death, then whatever you think your 'Heaven' is, is what you're going to hallucinate and trip.
**Reason For Posting** I Posted just to see if anyone else has gone through the same thoughts.

1263438947.0	apdof	Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson are NOT Christians.	rDr4g0n	60	29	78	"This post isn't about believing in Christianity or Jesus or anything like that. I know many of you simply do not. This post is about the retards that appear to be leaders of Christians and how they don't follow the rules of the faith they profess belief in.  

&gt;**Luke 9:52-55**  
...Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, ""Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"" But Jesus turned and rebuked them, and they went to another village.  

Though he might have just been trying to cover the fact that he can't really reign fire down on cities, he was probably telling them to quite being retarded, and turn the other cheek. Speaking of which:  

&gt;**Matthew 5:38-40**  
""You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.  

Sounds an awful lot like Pat and Rush need to be going to Haiti right now and giving the villagers their *own* clothes. In fact, Jesus had a reputation for hanging out with 'sinners'.  

&gt;**Matthew 9:10 - 13**  
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and ""sinners"" came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, ""Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"" On hearing this, Jesus said, ""It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.""  

Once again, the idea is that Christianity is the cure, and Christians aren't supposed to just hang out with each other acting like they're better than everyone: They're supposed to be out there with the 'sick', healing them.  

I'm not trying to convert anyone, or say that Christianity is the ultimate answer, etc, etc. I'm just pointing out their own hypocrisy. 

**Fuck Rush and Fuck Pat. They need to read the fucking Bible.**

---

1\. **The books are geared toward shutting down reasonable discussion, not opening it up.** They are pushing a particular perception of religion, and rigidly oppose any suggestions that religion might not be as they describe it. Their arguments are built toward justifying a particular kind of opposition to religion.

*examples:* See below.

2\. **They espouse a shallow and misleading view of history.** The view of history they present as a long clash between religion and secularism breaks down when you look at the details. The flaws in their arguments can usually be shown by looking at the very sources they cite. They ignore evidence that doesn't contribute to their arguments, even when that evidence is more relevant.

*examples:* Harris' account of the Gujurat riots ignores evidence of political, economic and historical motives; Hitchens' account of the Rwandan genocides focuses mostly on incidental details; Dennett's inquiry into the origins of religion is wildly speculative.

3\. **The gods they reject are gods that they themselves have created.** They start off on the wrong foot by assuming that gods are, for most theists, a way of explaining the unexplained. They dismiss or misunderstand the traditional argument for God. As a result, their arguments are calculated to knock down straw men.

*examples:* Dawkins' argument that God is improbable only works against a version of god that differs sharply from the Abrahamic tradition; Harris' descriptions of gods are mostly inconsistent; Hitchens' complains that a real god would have created a better world than this, then results to ad hominem.

4\. **Their criticisms of faith are based on faulty accounts of belief.** They imply that religious belief is psychologically abnormal. They paint it as necessarily and inevitably dangerous. Meanwhile, their own beliefs *about* belief and religion are riddled with logical contradictions. To cover for those contradictions, they sometimes insist on the right to assign beliefs that religious believers themselves disavow.

*examples:* Dawkins insists on ""the religious mind"" as an ad hominem; Harris insists that beliefs are held as logical propositions; Dennett's study of ""non-believing"" clergy misrepresents its subject by constraining them to a narrow definition of gods.

5\. **The ways they define and identify religion don't match up with religion as we observe it in the real world.** They're committed to the idea that religion boils down to creed. By their criteria, some things that everyone acknowledges as religion would be excluded from the category, while some things that we don't recognize as religion would be included. It might be better to identify religion according to the way in which it uses ritual.

*examples:* Harris insists that Buddhism is not a religion; both Harris and Hitchens identify certain political movements as religions; Dennett insists that religions must focus on supernatural agents, like gods.

6\. **They consistently mangle moral philosophy.** In arguing that religion is inherently immoral, they commit themselves to opposing moral relativism. The moral systems they argue for are mostly casuistry with no apparent foundation underneath. At times, this leads to a kind of moral elitism, where normal people are excepted to cede moral responsibility to specialists.

*examples:* The evolution of altruism does not, on its own, provide the basis for an objectively moral sense. Dawkins argues for a progressive moral Zeitgeist; the problems with *The Moral Landscape* are too numerous to list here.

7\. **Their real innovation was to revive an outdated philosophy.** Nearly all of the major points of the books are updated versions of 18th century arguments. The history of the last 300 years has shown how dangerous some of those positions can be. They gloss over valid criticisms mostly by ignoring or cherry-picking the past.

*examples:* Dawkins updates the historical dialectic as a moral theory; Harris and Dennett undercut John Stuart Mill's rights of conscience; Hitchens espouses a Freudian interpretation of religion.

8\. **They're committed to dividing society up along partisan lines.** The books are preoccupied with classifying the right people as atheists, even if it means contradicting or denying what the purported atheists have to say on the matter. Any atheists who oppose are villified as ""accommodations."" Fundamentalists are presented as ""true believers,"" while religious moderates are dismissed with ""no true Scotsman"" arguments. The division of people into opposing camps grows into a vision of a zero-sum conflict between atheists and theists.

*examples:* Dawkins extends to fight over Einstein to include most scientists, even those who claim to be religious; Dennett tries to claim clergy, even when they object to his definition of theism; Hitchens argues that MLK fought for civil rights *in spite of* his religious beliefs.

9\. **They don't seem to realize that they are deeply conservative with respect to religion.** Like the Neoconservatives, they see themselves as defending the tradition of Western Liberalism by opposing what they take to be a threat to that tradition. This has sometimes led them to ally themselves with the Bush administration and defend European fascists. Ultimately, it leads them to flirt with policy suggestions that would undermine the very values they claim to defend.

*examples:* Harris gives the rationale for installing benevolent dictatorships as an element of foreign policy; Dennett suggests a name-and-shame campaign reminiscent of McCarthyism; Dawkins and Dennett suggest a legal rationale for removing children from otherwise non-abusive religious environments.

10\. **Atheists can do better.** No one need endorse books filled with that many specious arguments in order to make a case for secularism and toleration toward atheists. Ultimately, no needs a better reason to be atheist than that they don't find gods convincing. And the extent to which the ""New Atheist"" arguments have alienated moderate religious believers may have ultimately only made it harder to find allies.

Devistator	38	8	6	"First off, I am not a Muslim and I am not a Christian. I'm Agnostic. Even though I do have a small amount of hatred towards organized religions, I would never stoop to the ignorance of burning books. Rather than fall into the ignorance towards a religion, it makes more sense to learn it from an academic standpoint to form a proper debate. 

As I sit here, I'm watching Hardball with Chris Matthews interview one of the proponents of the Quran Burning Protest. One of his rebuttals to Matthew's questions on why even do this, he responded saying something like, ""Islam wants to rule the World, and it's us against them!"" I doubt this schmuck has even read the Bible.

So how about a Read the Quran Day? You don't have to go out and buy one. There are numerous sites on the net where you can find full text. I've listed a couple below. I bet just reading a handful of the passages will make you know more about Islam than those book burning bigots. 

**[Quran.com](http://quran.com)** Full textual break down with audio if you prefer. 

**[Quran Explorer](http://www.quranexplorer.com/quran/)** Seems like a search engine for certain passages and wording.

**[Listen 2 Quran](http://www.listen2quran.com)** It's like a boom box that plays whatever passage you select.

Like, who the fuck cares what other people believe, it's their life, let them believe what they want. Yeah so what if it's stupid that a magical guy popped out of a virgin and people center their lives around it. Just as you have the right to say,""hey that's stupid and I'm going to tell you why that's stupid and post it all over LITERALLY EVERYTHING"", they have the right to go,"" hey this is what makes me happy and gives me hope at the end of the day when I realize how shitty this life can really be"" without being criticized. Maybe it's just because I spend a lot of time on reddit, but I find far far more attacks towards Christians from atheists than I do the other way around. Any time I've talked to someone about why they're atheist, I get a vibe that they feel more entitled, like THEY are the ones who have it all figured out and everyone else is wrong and stupid for believing otherwise, when really, not a single one of us has it ""figured out"". Believe what you want, and voice your opinion about it all you want, but don't go around putting other beliefs down to raise your own up, because no one is ""right"", and at the same time, no one is ""wrong"".

You know, sometimes I think the Rabbi and the Cantor are hazing me for wanting to follow in their footsteps. ""You wanna read a portion for the High Holidays? Sure, here, have the one where God tells Abraham to sacrifice his only son. You wanna do a D'var Torah? Sure, here, have Korach.""

Korach. Wow. Ok, let's review. Korach, Dathan, Abiram, and 250 of their closest friends decide that maybe the Kohanim shouldn't be the only family to have the right to be high-priest. They decide to stage a coup. God opens up the Earth to swallow them and their families whole.

Alright, not the prettiest story. And let's be honest - many of the women and children who were ""owned"" by those rebelling men were innocents, caught in the crossfire of a war on God that they never asked for. But hey, I get it, God put the Kohanim in charge, and Korach and his friends were making a direct threat against the Kohanim themselves. Korach, too, was greedy - he wasn't saying ""Someone else should be in charge,"" he was saying ""*I* should be in charge."" And yes, you could argue that this was a declaration of war, and in war, innocents are lost.

But then came the next day, when the Israelite community protested those deaths. Men and women, innocent themselves but for seeing this mass death as an alarming overreaction to the simple defiance of a few of their cousins. And God sent a plague to kill 15,000 of them. For the crime of daring to question an injustice.

Whoa.

Someone once told me that the difference in Reform and Conservative and Orthodox Judaism is really a function of how those branches view changes in societal philosophy, and how they decide whether and how to adopt those changes. Orthodox Jews say ""If the Torah says we don't do it, we don't do it. We may find a way around the rule, but we'll never break the rule itself."" Conservative Jews say ""We know in our hearts that a change must happen, so we'll consult the wisdom of the Rabbis, and look for how they interpreted the intention of the Torah, and hopefully in so doing, we'll find a way to justify that change.""

And then you have Reform Jews, who say ""I don't care what the Torah says. I know, in my heart, what's right. And what the Torah, this ancient script upon which I've built my entire Faith, this book containing the greatest wisdom of God Itself, is telling me about how to think and pray and live and believe is just . . . it's not. Right.""

If you're a fan of the T.V. show The West Wing, as I am, you may remember an episode when the White House communications director argued with his Rabbi, who was hoping that his President would commute the sentence of a man who was to be put to death that evening. When his congregant pointed out that the Torah says ""an eye for an eye"", his Rabbi said, ""You know what it also says? It says a rebellious child can be brought to the city gates and stoned to death. It says homosexuality is an abomination and punishable by death. It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking reflected the best wisdom of its time, but it's just plain wrong by any modern standard.""

This. This is why I am a reform Jew. Because I'm far too busy devoting my time and energy to the brand of Judaism that is focused on fixing the World than to waste one second questioning whether any great Wisdom about loyalty and keeping your mouth shut can be gleaned from these words. For whatever reason God had at the time, and maybe it was what needed to be done in that moment, I know in my heart that this God in my World would be The Devil. It would be Stalin, it would be Pol Pot, it would be Hitler. And I would fight it with my last dying breath.

Don't get me wrong. I love and revere My God, precisely because I don't recognize My God in this text. And maybe that's the point, maybe that's the wisdom to be gleaned from Korach. Maybe God is writing us a love letter from long in the past and it says ""If you have the basic common sense to see my actions in the story of Korach as absolutely monstrous, then congratulations, you've learned to think for yourself. And maybe you now understand that this book was written, in part, for another people, in another time. And that's not to say you should abandon it, it's still a gift, a tome of incredible wisdom, but you now have the tools to see which words were meant for you, and which were meant for a small hoard of desert-dwelling nomads five millenia ago.

My words may sound blasphemous. Even treasonous. And if they are, I'm sure the Earth will swallow me whole. But the thing is, my words are God's. By which I mean, just as God gave us bread from the Earth by giving us all of the tools and skills and knowledge to make bread, so did God give us wisdom from the Torah by giving us the tools and skills and knowledge to find it. Our every breath and footfall are given to God - this notion is so engrained in our Judaism that we say ""Adonai s'fatai tiftach. Ufi yagid t'hilatecha."" ""Adonai, open up my lips, that my mouth may declare your praise.""

Well, today, God opened my lips to read a D'var Torah that condemned God's own actions. And can there be any greater evidence that we have, in five thousand years of study of Torah and supplication to God's commandments, been granted the right to question the unjust, no matter how Mighty?

If you don't know, here are some things to catch you up:
The Black Hills are considered sacred by these tribes. It is their genesis site, the setting of important myths, and many rituals are performed there.

By treaty, the land was granted to the tribes as a concession in the war between Sioux leaders such as Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, and Sitting Bull and the U.S. government.

Not surprisingly, the government illegally changed its mind when gold was found in the Black Hills, and they now no longer belong to the Sioux tribes.

Now about 2000 acres of it is for sale, because the Reynolds family (private owners) is auctioning it off on August 25th. The Rosebud Reservation has pledged $50,000 to purchasing the land, but the tribes are trying to raise as much as they can to win the auction.  Otherwise, the state of South Dakota has publicly stated their intention to develop the land, which includes building a road.

I stole this text from the friend who told me about all this.

TL/DR: Sioux have a chance to get a small part of a sacred site back but need some [help.](http://www.indiegogo.com/PeSla-LakotaHeartland?c=activity)

The cape is mostly white with small black stripes on it.

Every once in a while he will pull the cape over his head and wear it like it has a hat... and then bow an irregular number of times (ranging from 10 to at least 30).

1301601207.0	gfrvc	I did linear regression. After adjusting for standard of living I found no link between religion and violence		50	17	60	"I did a simple linear regression comparing 2004 murder rates by country with inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), and a gallop poll on importance of religion in various countries. I used 2004 murder rate per 100,000 people because that was the year that had the most countries represented, and I did not want to add economic variation into the data, so I stuck with one year. 

I used IHDI rather than HDI to adjust for countries with great income disparities where rich pull the index down and poor pull the crime rate up. 

I also used murder rates rather than rapes or some other crimes, because murders tend to be reported everywhere while rapes may not be due to social stigma. 

All of the data came from Wikipedia

[Importance of religion by country]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_of_religion_by_country)

[List of countries by intentional Homicide rate]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)

[List of countries by IHDI]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI)

Regression was done with Excel regression tool. 

Results:

Regressing IHDI against murder rate gives us a slope of -11.2 and a p-value of 16%. That means that for every one unit increase in IHDI there is a drop in murder rate of 11, and there is only a 16% chance that this is by accident. 

Regressing religiousness by murder rate gives us a slope of 6.2 and a p-value of 36%. That means that with every unit increase of religiousness, murder rate increases by 6 but there is 36% chance that this is by a pure chance (i.e. no real link).

Now it’s known that both religion and crime correlate with the standard of living which means that they should also correlate with each other. So by regressing murder rate with both IHDI and religiousness at the same time, we should see how much each variable contributes and explains the murder rate. 

The result is that for IDHI, slope is -11.8 and p-value is 29%, and for religiousness it’s -0.7 and 94%. It appears that after adjusting for standard of living there is almost no correlation between murder and religiousness, or if anything, religion decreases murder rates.

1297204163.0	fhrmd	I believe that Science and Religion can co-exist.	Maclimes	45	11	50	"Imagine the following scenario:

I spent years building for you a music box. This was no ordinary music box, though. Inside, dozens of tiny figurines, detailed and elegant, danced in complex patterns and beautiful maneuvers. The music itself is created by a harmony of tiny bells, creating a symphony of breath-taking majesty and skill. The outside of the box is decorated with amazing silver and ivory work, featuring your name embossed in gorgeous golden filigree.

I present this box as a gift to you, never telling you that it was actually a music box. You love the box and it's amazing craftsmanship. You set it on your desk, where you admire it's beauty every day. But you never thought to open the box. To you, it is still a gorgeous and wonderful gift, one that you genuinely appreciate. But to me it is bittersweet, because I know that you haven't seen the true beauty of the gift. All you see is the pretty box, never knowing that inside was an amazing and complex pattern of interconnected music, gears, and dancers, all made just for you. I am pleased you like the gift, but I am sad that you missed the most beautiful part of it.

That, I imagine, is how God feels when we ignore science. The universe is an amazing creation, a complex system of interactions. Protons and electrons, carbon and hydrogen, amino acids and antibodies, lungs and heart, bees and flowers, clouds and rivers, Earth and Moon, stars and black holes... All of it is part of the dance inside the music box that God has created for us to enjoy. 

To embrace science is not to turn your back on God. The opposite, in fact. To embrace science is to truly see and appreciate his creation.

So, for God's sake, open the box."	t5_2qh39	True

To be a little more specific:  if G-d was Mary's partner in conception then only Mary's lineage matters as Joseph has no genetic link to Jesus.   Its my understanding that this link to King David is major evidence supporting Jesus as Messiah as this link is specificly indicated in the old Testament as a requirement of the one true Messiah.

Did something change or is someone wrong?	simonmitchell13	38	10	184	"In the King James version, let me know if you need book/chapter/verse numbers, God tells Moses things like ""you can only eat animals with cloven hooves that chew cud or else you are unclean."" Then later Jesus says ""things you take into your body don't make you unclean, only the things that come out.""

To me, this sounds like a clear cut case of someone being wrong. Did Moses misinterpret? Was Jesus clearly not in line with whomever it was that told Moses the laws?

I'm 37 now.  This is really hard for me to describe, but for the past 10 years or so, I keep having this feeling like.. I don't know how to put it in words.  It's just.. I find myself looking into the sky at night and feeling things that don't make any sense. 

I'm educated in the sciences, I don't believe in magic, I see stars and nebula, and I know that they are.  I see life all around me and recognize the similarities and truly believe that they evolved along side my species.  I'm not saying science has 100% explained anything, I know for a fact we're probably wrong about everything.  But that's how science works.. and I believe in the struggle to understand through logic, even if it means making a lot of mistakes.

I've read the Bible (both books) a long time ago, and the Koran (given to me by a kindly cab driver a few years back).  

I have this feeling in me that won't go away.  I find myself overwhelmed with emotion sometimes when I'm by myself in nature. I feel like there is *something* there, but I don't know what to call it.

But the holy books read like something written by a human- they are more concerned with population expansion and politics than they are about understanding our place in the universe.  They don't feel in any way divine to me.  And every time I speak to a ""holy man"" regardless of their denomination/religion they just come across as being very opinionated and stuck on a handful of irrelevant (and to my mind, incorrect) facts.

The thing I'm trying to understand feels big and profound, but when I talk to the people I know, they're understanding of it makes them more hateful than good.  

So I'm here on Reddit asking if anyone else is as lost as I am. I know its a journey that probably has no destination. Maybe I'm just looking for some company along the way.

1. Counter to any claims, ID is **not** a scientific theory. Science is about empirical study of the natural world. A scientific theory is a refutable *model for natural phenomena*, not a philosophy about what the physical nature is or should mean to us.

2. A scientific theory can be refuted on the basis of either empirical evidence that can't be explained by (incompleteness) or contradicts (physical incorrectness) the model, or by logical contradictions in the model itself (logical incorrectness). Anything that can't ever, not in a billion years, be refuted empirically, is utterly useless and shouldn't be called a scientific theory.
 
3. Natural selection, as a process, is a fact, not a theory: things that survive, survive more than things that don't survive.

4. Prior to any attempt at refuting evolution, one must accept all the well established yet-to-be refuted theories that support evolution (such as nuclear isotope dating), or otherwise refute them too.

5. Evolution is NOT about ""advances"", it's about adaptation, so all the attempts to refute it on that basis are wrong.

6. There is a heap of evidence in favor of evolution, so you need to counter each and every one of them.

7. As far as I know, ID:

  * Is not a scientific theory (irrefutable)

  * Does not refute any known, well established scientific theory



Now, as a religious person:

1. My religion is about ethics and philosophy (dealing with the meaning of my life in the world, and the right way to live it),  not about science (structure of the natural world, and how we can use it)

2. I **do** believe that the world is ""created"" by a unified entity, each and every moment (insert some philosophy here), but I don't think my religion really wants to talk about the natural history of the world.

3. I don't need any ""scientific"" theory to support my beliefs, because science does not and **can't, won't ever contradict** them.

4. Part of my belief is that human logic is a basic valid tool for making decisions and finding things out, so at any apparent contradiction between logic &amp; religion, there must be either a logical or religious mistake. Logical mistakes can be discovered, albeit not always easily (mostly the source is wrong assumptions).

To get an idea - my cousin missed church on Easter once and they found out. My grandfather lectured her for over an hour and she said that it was the worst hour of her life.

My grandparents aren't crazy - they're amazing and caring people, but they take religion VERY seriously. My parents are the same, so I won't get any help there... they want me to go to church but don't lecture me about it and won't force me to. I'm 28yrs old. I'm not a child and can make my own decisions - they know that.

Anyway, I'm atheist and will only do church on holidays to make my parents (who I owe the world to) happy.

I won't tell my parents or grandparents that I'm atheist. It would crush them and I'd never hear the end of it. That won't happen... a) I don't want to hear their lectures for as long as they're around and b) it would seriously hurt them and I don't want to do that.

Anyone have advice on how I can handle this maturely and without it ending in my family and losing all respect for me?

PS - Maybe this is a post for r/atheism, but I think you guys may be able to provide better advice. They'll tell me to man up and tell them the truth, but I really don't see that happening. It would ruin a relationship with people that I love and have given me so much.

Apparently this guy is a hero because he was let into the police force and not made to trim his beard. He did not stand up for his beliefs, the police let him in to show how mulitcultural they are. This guy refuses to shave because he believes that hair is part of the body God gave him and he has no right to alter it. That's a great belief and I stand by him 100% in believing it. However, I do not stand behind the fact that the only reason he was ALLOWED to believe it was because he was a Sikh. 

Muslim girls cover their hair so that they are not ogled by men. This was advice from Muhammed iirc, I may be wrong. Again, I stand by their right to do this. Schools allow them to do it even if it's against dress code because they strongly believe it is right to cover their hair. The problem I have is that if a white girl covered her hair and dressed modestly because she didn't want to be ogled her teacher would say ""take the hat off!"" Even if she said she didn't want to be ogled she'd be forced to take it off. The only reason Muslim girls are allowed to is because ""it's part of their religion.""

Guess what, guys? Religions are not giant identical blocks handed out to people. Everyone gets to believe whatever they want. We ARE allowed to pick and choose what we believe.

I recently had this conversation with my mom. She said I wouldn't be allowed to wear a beard because ""I'm not Sikh."" I told her that although I am a nontheist I could very well believe that shaving a beard is wrong. ""You're not Sikh though, so you can't do it. If you want to pray to the Sikh gods every day and wear a turban you can wear a beard all you like!"" 

Discuss.

EDIT: If it wasn't clear, I'm not saying ""they shouldn't let the Sikh guy wear a beard"" I'm saying ""if they are willing to let a Sikh guy wear a beard because he believes God wants him too they should let anyone else with similar beard-based beliefs wear beards regardless of their other beliefs."""	t5_2qh39	True

1268161560.0	bb9aa	How to Keep Jehovah's Witnesses Off Your Porch	moralnihilist	37	13	43	"I've seen this discussion happen a few times and seeing that I used to be a JW I felt I should rectify a number of misconceptions people have about the sect, specifically in why they keep coming back to your house.  I found that most people either have no idea (or even the wrong idea) of how to keep the J-Dubs away. There are a number of pitfalls one can find him or herself in when dealing with Jehovah's Witnesses, so here are some tips to avoid them:


**DO NOT** accept their literature just to get rid of them

To a Jehovah's Witness, accepting their literature is tantamount to an invitation to come back.  It doesn't matter how glaringly obvious your body language was to the contrary, JWs are exceptionally thick when it comes to nonverbal hints that you're not interested.  Even if they realize you aren't interested, they're hoping that *you will be* after you read what they've given you.  They are instructed to follow-up with *everybody* they place literature with, so accepting said literature only gives them the wrong impression.


**DO NOT** just say ""I'm not interested""

They may say thank you and leave, but they also might try to figure out *why* you're not interested. They are taught how to overcome objections, and whether or not they actually attempt this depends on how much tact the individual JW has.


**DO NOT** say ""I have my own religion""

Jehovah's Witnesses don't knock on doors looking for other Jehovah's Witnesses. They are specifically targeting people who don't share the same beliefs.  That's what recruiting is.  While you might think telling them that you're a Catholic or a Hindu is going to get them to back off, what you're actually doing is telling them ""I am the person you're looking for.""


**DO NOT** hide

Jehovah's Witnesses divide their local area up into territories. Each territory is worked every six months if possible. In order to consider a territory to be ""worked,"" *every single person* living in that territory must be contacted.  Hiding from them will either result in them coming back in a few days, or getting a pamphlet stuck in your door.  Besides, as someone who did their door-to-door recruiting thing for the first two decades of his life, I can assure you that *they know when you're hiding.*  Most people really, really suck at it.  Seriously.  After standing at your door for a few minutes they go back to their car and laugh at you.


**DO NOT** assume your ""No Solicitors"" sign will stop them

A solicitor is someone who is selling a product or service. While it is true that Jehovah's Witnesses used to sell their religious literature, this has not been the case for nearly two decades now.  Ever since a court case in California ruled that sales of religious literature can be taxed, the Witnesses now *give away* their literature free of charge. They ask you for a voluntary donation in order to support their ""world wide work,"" but receiving their publications is not contingent on you giving a donation.  A Jehovah's Witness will give you anything they're offering without you paying a cent, and legally this is not soliciting.  They know this, and routinely ignore ""No Soliciting"" signs.


**DO NOT** open the door naked, tell them you worship the devil, or otherwise behave erratically

They might be flustered, but typically in this situation it makes for an interesting ""war story"" on their part, but they don't write any of it down. You're not going to scare them away forever by answering the door in a devil mask.  Plus, chances are if you run into a sufficiently jaded JW, they're not going to believe you anyway.


**DO** post a ""No Trespassing"" sign clearly visible on your property

Until a few decades ago it was legal for anyone to walk to your front door and knock without it being considered trespassing.  That ruling has since changed and Jehovah's Witnesses were advised many years ago that violating such a sign is now done *at their own individual risk* and that their organization would not help them with any legal troubles as a result.  If a JW knocks on your door despite the No Trespassing sign, they are committing a crime. They are regularly advised this, and most will not risk violating one.


**DO** ask to be placed on their ""do not call"" list

Jehovah's Witnesses keep ""do not call"" records for every territory, and they will comply with any request to be placed on their list.  Once on this list, they will only contact you once a year or so to make sure that A) it's still the same people living in the house, and B) you still feel the same.


**MAYBE** tell them you're disfellowshipped

Jehovah's Witnesses are not supposed to talk to disfellowshipped (a.k.a. excommunicated) former Witnesses. Most of the time, telling them this at the door will result in them abruptly ending the conversation and leaving.  *However*, elders *are* allowed to speak to them, and if a church elder is at your door, he may start to probe you for information. Use this at your own risk.

They didn't understand the term, and I noticed that a lot of people don't for some reason. I wrote this up to try to help them understand.


The definitions following are the modern usage of the words. 

- Theist: Belief in a deity. 

- Atheist: Lack of a belief in a deity. 

- Gnostic: Position that we can ultimately know whether or not a god exists. 

- Agnostic: Position that we can't ultimately know whether or not god exists. 

Gnosticism can also be known as a ""Strong position"" and Agnosticism known as a ""Weak position."" 

So people can be 1 of 4 things. 

- Gnostic Theist: Belief that a god does exist, and we can ultimately know this is true. 

- Gnostic Atheist: Belief that a god doesn't exist, and we can ultimately know this is true. 

- Agnostic Theist: Belief that a god does exist, but we can't actually know if this is true. 

- Agnostic Atheist: Lack of a belief in a god because we can't ultimately know if one exists. 

Many religious people and theists are Gnostic Theists. 

Most self-proclaimed atheists and agnostics are Agnostic Atheists. 

How to tell what you are: 

*Do you personally hold a distinct belief in a deity of any sort?* 

- If you do not believe in a deity, you are an atheist. 

- If you do believe in a deity, you are a theist. 

*Do you believe your position is absolutely correct?* 

- If you do, you are gnostic. 

- If you don't, you are agnostic. 

Think about it this way. Which one of these do you agree with the most? 

- I know God exists. (Gnostic Theist) 

- I know God does not exist. (Gnostic Atheist) 

- I think God exists. (Agnostic Theist) 

- I think God doesn't exist. (Agnostic Atheist)

Problems may occur when defining ""deity."" Deity is typically defined as: a recognized preternatural or supernatural immortal being, who may be thought of as holy, divine, or sacred, held in high regard, and respected by believers.

Here is a chart.

Within the terms theism and atheism, there are many branches of other beliefs, such as deism, pantheism, apatheism, etc.

Edit: Well now, this has started a good discussion. It seems as though many people feel as though these are new terms that aren't used widely. Although, I use them all the time because I believe they reflect beliefs accurately.

For example, I don't believe in a deity. In fact, I believe the chance that a deity exists is very small. The thing is though, I don't really know if a God does exist or does not exist, so I can't honestly say, ""a god does not exist."" What does this make me? An agnostic or an atheist? Well... an agnostic atheist, right? That'd be the most accurate definition."	t5_2qh39	True

Which was the primal germ cell of the mind
The Seers, searching in their hearts with wisdom,
discovered the connection of Being in Nonbeing.

A crosswise line cut Being from Nonbeing. 
What was described above it, what below? 
Bearers of seed there were and mighty forces, 
thrust from below and forward move above.

Who really knows? Who can presume to tell it? 
Whence was it born? Whence issued this creation? 
Even the Gods came after its emergence. 
Then who can tell from whence it came to be?

That out of which creation has arisen, 
whether it held it firm or it did not, 
He who surveys it in the highest heaven, 
He surely knows - or maybe He does not!""

Not only does this poem come from possibly the oldest book ever ~1300BC, The Rig Veda (some indian religious book), but it puts a russian dolls perspective on the universe, something I haven't thought about in such a way. Even though it's from an ancient religious text, it's just such a mature contemplation. That even as we accept the gods in heaven, they are merely a part of this world. Just the notion that while people knew so little about the world and how it worked, they still pondered the very basic questions we haven't begun to answer today, and to such depth. it blows my mind.

Help?	anonymous9000	35	9	90	"My closest friends and I started having a discussion about religion recently. Usually I shy away from these because I am greatly outnumbered and not totally confident about my beliefs (or non-beliefs). Turns out; it doesn't matter. From what I have been told, under Christianity I am going to burn and rot in hell for the rest of my eternal existence along with my parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

Now, ""that's an odd way to phrase it"", you might say. But I say it specifically that way for a reason… During our conversation I would say something along those lines and it would literally make my friends cringe and respond with ""don't put it THAT way!"". 

So, my questions to you are: Is that the actual teaching of Christianity? Do they condemn morally good people (such as myself, and countless others) to hell for not practicing their form of religion? Is there no morally good person loop hole? How do they expect all humans to hear of Christianity so they can become ""saved"" before they die? How can they be some of my best friends but also believe what they are telling me? Wouldn't that create a huge conflict within themselves? How can they request that I phrase it nicer when they are the ones condemning? How is it that I have never once thought because they practice a different form of religion than me, that they would end up in hell? (I know Judaism doesn't believe in hell, but I digress.) Does condemning people to hell not cause a moral conflict by itself? ""I'm not a mean person!"", they would say. But, from my perspective, that's about the cruelest thing I have ever been told.

Thank you sincerely for your help, Reddit. Hopefully you can lead me to some answers. "	t5_2qh39	True

I’ll tell you that I was in Texas, but won’t be more specific than that. I am from an upper-middle class white suburban family. This occurred during a 3 year stretch of my early adolescence. About five or six families met in a home every Sunday night. The group was mostly adults but there were about 15 kids as well, one of which was me (age 10-14ish). Me and my two siblings were the only ones who weren’t homeschooled. There was a clear leader of this bunch who claimed to be and was seen as a Christian prophet. His teachings centered on an obsession with the biblical prediction of the apocalypse, and the idea that Christ was returning extremely, extremely soon.  Often members would come and report on visions or dreams that they had to be interpreted. There was also an obsession with angels and demons. Several “gifted” members, namely the leader’s wife and oldest daughter (my age) would have visions of angels while around the rest of the group and would converse with them, asking them questions on the behalf of the ungifted members, treating the angels like oracles. The leader would report to having seen visions of demons and taught that demons lived inside of people and caused them to sin. This belief led to exorcisms becoming weekly common-practice. These aren’t exactly like what movies show them as, but usually involved extended periods of laying hands on members while praying in tongues. The recipients of the prayer would often react violently speak on behalf of the specific demon that was inside of them. The people praying would speak to the demons, calling them out by name (“spirit of fear”, “spirit of rebellion”, etc). When a woman would act outside of the permission of her husband or go beyond the groups idea of normal activity for a woman , an exorcism would be performed to remove the “spirit of jezebel” from them. Oddly, most of the sexism was implemented by the women.  


This “cult” reached it’ climax when the leader’s eldest daughter reported seeing angel armies marching through the house we were in, which signaled the beginning of the apocalypse. We stayed up until the morning praying, chanting, etc. I think when we went back to our lives after this, people realized how crazy it all was and we haven’t met since. 


Feel free to post questions. 

p.s. I still consider myself a Christian, but nothing like these people.

1325254256.0	nw93i	"""The myth of religious violence"""		34	9	8	"This is the daring if somewhat misleading title of a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Religious-Violence-Ideology-Conflict/dp/0195385047/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325253458&amp;sr=8-1) by theologian and historian William Cavanaugh. It is slightly misleading because Cavanaugh's argument (as he is at pains to repeatedly make clear) is not that religious people hardly every commit violence at all, but his claim is much more fundamental: **he questions the use of the very distinction between religious and secular forms of violence; the idea of ""religion"" as a transcultural, transhistorical phenomenon, and as a result the distinction between religion and secular that lies at the basis of the modern secular state, is a myth in both senses of the word.**

1. It's a myth in the sense of a falsehood in that religion is simply not analytically separable from 'secular' parts of society like economy, politics etc. So to talk about what role ""religion"" played as opposed to politics in, for example, the crusades, is hopelessly anachronistic and simply not helpful.
2. It is a myth in the sense of a foundational narrative to justify certain societal arrangements, in that the distinction between ""religion"" and ""the secular"" was used in the early modern period in Europe to justify the transfer of power from the church to the national state, which then styled itself as secular. Moreover, modern secular states often draw upon the narrative of how ""religion"" is especially prone to irrational violence in order to justify its own policies regarding peoples who are described as being religious. In the words of Cavanaugh:

*""But what is implied in the conventional wisdom is that there is an essential difference between religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism, on the one hand, and secular ideologies and institutions such as nationalism, Marxism, capitalism, and liberalism, on the other, and that the former are essentially more prone to violence—more absolutist, divisive, and irrational—than the latter. It is this claim that I ﬁnd both unsustainable and dangerous. It is unsustainable because ideologies and institutions labeled secular can be just as absolutist, divisive, and irrational as those labeled religious. It is dangerous because it helps to marginalize, and even legitimate violence against, those forms of life that are labeled religious. What gets labeled religious and what does not is therefore of crucial importance. The myth of religious violence tries to establish as timeless, universal, and natural a very contingent set of categories—religious and secular—that are in fact constructions of the modern West. Those who do not accept these categories as timeless, universal, and natural are subject to coercion.""* (p. 6)

I'm not being sarcastic, My elementary school left me convinced that there was one indisputable bad guy.  To this day, I'm fully convinced that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party were the worst institutionalized bigotry the world has ever seen.   

That said, over the past 5-10 years or so, I've grown increasingly concerned that I hold antisemetic views.   
I'm an unabashed lover of the underdog, and maybe watching ""Death in Gaza"" completely undid the lifetime of sympathy for Judaism I had from books and movies, it's not likely though.  The problem seems to me to have eerie parallels to European/Native American conflict, without all the small pox to declare a decisive victor, but my intention isn't to start a middle east discussion.  

I have little doubt, if I am an antisemite, it is rooted in Zionism.  

Another antisemitic concern I have is that Jews represent 2% of the population of the United States, but seem to be way over represented in many fields of influence, by an order of magnitude.  I won't list them all because I'm not in the business of spreading antisemitism.  

Are these views reasonable or have I stumbled myself into a form of bigotry?"	t5_2qh39	True
