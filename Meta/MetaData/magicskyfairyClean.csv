1363338426.0	1acb58	Dear /r/Magicskyfairy bashers	Horizons93	266	37	82	"So you have figured out that the majority of /r/magicskyfairy isn't very happy with religion and believe that religions are pretty silly. You might find some of this shit offensive even. You might even feel that you need to post about how much /r/magicskyfairy sucks.


I have a 10 step plan in order for you to correct this issue.


1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about /r/magicskyfairy. Might as well get this out of the way so when it *is* recommended, you can proudly claim 'I've done that already' and the discussion can continue. A broken bottle is ideal, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.


2. Repeat step 1 to ensure completion.


3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, you don't HAVE to read the memes, sagan quotes, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.


4. Repeat step 1 again.


5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, you might legitimately not understand a LARGE portion of our users. Google the Bible belt. I will wait..... Ok, that's long enough. There are many atheist teens in the Bible belt, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.



6. Repeat step 1


7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious *people*, we do find their beliefs silly and worth mocking. However, religion is responsible for many deaths in Iran, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.


8. Repeat step one, one last time.


9. If you are still here and have concerns, discuss. If not, unsubscribe button is on the right, have a nice day and don't forget to go fuck yourself.

Preferring heavy text-based discussions does not automatically mean you are more intelligent than others. Stop trying to enforce YOUR ontology (Is that right? My thesaurus said it was) on others! That is exactly what religious nuts having been doing to us for centuries. We've had enough. Please return the subreddit to its previous state and stop assuming you are speaking for us ""older intellectuals"".

EDIT: I'm not stating my age, honour from the queen, my career as an astronaut, fitness level or academic credentials to impress anyone with how authoritative my arguments should be seen as. I'm stating it to demonstrate that educated people older than 16 can also dislike the changes. 

SUPER NON PRETENTIOUS EDIT: If anything this post has shown me that ""karma whoring"" would be just as easy using text as using maymays (IN YOUR FACE!!!) . It has also shown that the Internet is definitely like a school playground where most people believe that any argument can be won by shouting ""no you're not!"" and stamping your feet (But definitely not what my argument does)  If you paid attention you would have seen that I capitalized the word ALSO in my post title. I was not trying to ""argue from astronautomy"" I was trying to present a counterpoint to the popular assumption that people in my demographic would by default prefer the new moderation policy. After reading all the ""meaningful"" attacks posted as comments here I'm starting to believe that it might actually be better to not have new redditors easily discover this subreddit. This much hubris would probably scare them right back to church.

In short fuck you jijler and tuberculosis. 

FINAL EDIT: Many of the comments attacked me for stating my age and education in the post title. Ask yourself this: If I used ""I'm oreography and I ALSO want the old rules for /atheism back"" as the title, how many views would I have gotten? YOUR response (even the negative ones) to my post made it worth my while. So criticize all you want. At least my view has been heard loud and clear.

* ""Religion is, but a single atom in the collective sea of human stupidity.""

* ""I am insulted by the mental flatulence of those whose minds dwell in the land of the make-believe...""

* ""My mind glistens with the enlightenment of wisdom, that only a decade of atheism could bring. There isn't a day that goes by, when I don't pity those who are still embroiled in the cosmic hocus pocus that is religious belief.""

* ""If you need a God to tell you life is worth living, then your life was never worth living in the first place.""

* ""God is 'dog' spelled backwards. Why then, are we consistently surprized when the religious act like backward dogs?""

* ""Faith is for those who lack reason. Reason is for those who lack gullibility.""

**[For a more powerful, 19th century feel, I have included the following quote to aid on your theistic destruction]**

* ""'Tis but a simple beggars mind that resorts to the mental tomfoolery of the priest and the sorcerer. Reject it thus, and thine mind shall shine with the luminosity of a pristine pearl.""

1370453519.0	1fqepc	The neutering of r/atheism; or how the Christians kind of got what they wanted.	twentyone_21	212	32	62	"   There has been much stated on both sides of the Mod policy change, with some for and some against the changes. But, in the discussion we overlook one thing, the reputation of this community.

   r/atheism has an online reputation that it has built up over the years, and that reputation has drawn many of those questioning their faith to check the place out, where they saw an edgy, exciting, lively place where religion was mocked, debunked, and treated less as a sacred cow and more as a cow in the slaughterhouse. 

   Now, questioning atheists will come here based on it's reputation, expecting a vibrant community and find what has been since the change a boring, bland, lifeless place full of news you could easily have gotten off any of the hundreds of news sites out there.

   Christians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, and with this mod policy change they've gotten the next best thing. Now, atheism doesn't seem so exciting or interesting and will seem as boring as their religion. They couldn't get rid of the sub-reddit but they could, through their constant whining and complaining about the sub-reddit, get it's hipness neutered. This way, in their view,  people checking out the place won't be swayed as easily to the dark side.

   The old r/atheism was a vibrant mix of serious and silly, and if you wanted more serious or more silly, there were sub-reddits for those. But now, it's just links to other news sites posts for the most part, and most first time visitors will never know about the other more vibrant atheism sub-reddits.

   Yes, the place was sometimes like a blood sport with no actual blood, as christian trolls and atheist trolls squared off, but now it's like going to high tea at grandma's.

   Will I unsubscribe? No. But, only because I want Atheism to remain a default sub-reddit with it's posts making the front page of Reddit in general. It may be a more boring atheism than it was, but I still want it to get exposure to people, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence. I just won't be checking it as frequently as I used to.

   But, I think changing the mod policy was a disservice to those who use the sub-reddit regularly, who weren't even given a chance to have a say in the change, and it is a disservice to the atheism community in general by reducing what was a vital, vibrant hub for atheism online to a [limp and flaccid shadow of what it was.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fq4iv/the_neutering_of_ratheism_or_how_the_christians/)

OccupyTamriel	180	27	88	"- ""Christians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, and with this mod policy change they've gotten the next best thing. Now, atheism doesn't seem so exciting or interesting and will seem as boring as their religion. They couldn't get rid of the sub-reddit but they could, through their constant whining and complaining about the sub-reddit, get it's hipness neutered. This way, in their view, people checking out the place won't be swayed as easily to the dark side.
Will I unsubscribe? No. But, only because I want Atheism to remain a default sub-reddit with it's posts making the front page of Reddit in general. It may be a more boring atheism than it was, but I still want it to get exposure to people, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence.""

- ""r/atheism has an online reputation.""

- ""all that stuff was the reason i became an atheist. fuck this bullshit.
im just not that into the sub that saved my life anymore. it was the memes and the jokes that made me comfortable enough to accept my disbelief, and i dont think i would have been able to ""come out"" without them.""

- ""If the reputation of r/atheism is terrible it is because christians go all over the internet spreading that reputation to keep people away. Christians don't want people going to this sub-reddit, and will bad mouth it, subscribe and unsubscribe to make it look bad, and generally do whatever they can to keep people away from it.""

- ""I also think we are overlooking an important thing. young people age 13-19 would tend to gravitate to the memes and facebook screencaps. they are the next generation. where many of them used to be privy to seeing the crappy side of religion daily and formed their opinions based on it, now, we're probably influencing the 20-40 age group.
Well, we tried, the next generation might shift back to religious, the r/atheism of the past will be a myth that we will be nostalgic about in years to come.""

- ""I wouldn't be here posting this now without the ragecomics and Facebook screencaps and meme images. their humor brought me to the place where I could accept the criticism the more serious conversations threw at me.
I spent many a night compiling a folder full of images I called ""theism"" from here, which I still browse through from time to time when I get irritated by the people around me because of stupid things they say or do related to religion. I'm sure I'm not alone. I'm sure those laughs are very important to people.""

- ""but I still want it to get exposure to people, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence.""

- ""Now it's just a bunch of news stories that makes it seem more like we're attacking individual ""idiots"" instead of the general misogynistic and racist religion itself.
People will come here and think: ""Ah, it's okay that I'm christian as long as I'm not an asshole like that guy about it"" without realizing what views they're really aligning themselves with.
That's my opinion, anyway.""

- ""People are warned against it in church. This sub has got the church scared shitless their secret is finally out and the gravy train may soon be over. This is a war for them.""

- ""Mocking religion is one of the best tools we have to spread the ideas of atheism &amp; reason. People don't like to have their ridiculous beliefs shoved in their face.""

- ""If the reputation of r/atheism is terrible it is because christians go all over the internet spreading that reputation to keep people away. Christians don't want people going to this sub-reddit, and will bad mouth it, subscribe and unsubscribe to make it look bad, and generally do whatever they can to keep people away from it.""

- ""I said to myself, "" I'm Christian, but that shit cray"" the more and more I started saying that, the more I realized I am not a Christian, but a logical thinker, and perhaps Christianity is not for people that think rationally.""

- ""I was raised a religious fundie. The earth was 6,000 years old, end of story. Why? Because the Bible said so, dammit dangit! I was sent to a private Christian school for twelve years. We barely did biology, and in Logic class, we were shown videos of a brilliant new apologist, better known today as the Banana Man[1] . I shit you not, we watched Banana Man in fucking Logic class. And the scary part is, my impressionable, still-developing 16-year-old brain was 100% convinced by this bullshit. And I was the valedictorian.
My point to all this is, religion grabs kids as soon as they exit the vag and begins to build walls around their minds. By the time they discover places like reddit, those minds are a fucking fortress. You can hurl all the Evolution, Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Anthropology, Philosophy, and Logic you want at those walls for years, and it may not even make a mark. I know, because I remember what it was like.""

- ""This is fascism right here. Our own little microcosm has developed fascism. I hope you're proud of yourself.""

- ""Thank you OP. You have put it beautifully. /r/atheism is (was) probably the single best deconversion entity on the internet. I still remember the Southpark meme stating ""Hey this is a cool website. Aaaaaaaaaaaand I'm an atheist."" - it describes exactly what /r/atheism is (was).""

- ""How do you propose we overthrow them [The Mods]? Lenin always said a solid revolutionary plan was necessary for success""

- ""Religion is silly. Period.
Any attempt to side-step that or draw attention away from that only legitimizes religion ultimately.""

- ""I didn't come here for thoughtful discussion. I can do that elsewhere; in real life and on the internet (such as /r/trueatheism). I came here because I wanted to laugh and share other people's experiences. Who cares the same stuff was posted more than once? Tons of people still enjoyed it. I probably won't frequent this site as much as I used to.""

- ""If this subreddit is not open and free, then I honestly don't see the point.
Socrates died for this shit and we're taking it too lightly.""

- ""Do you know why religion is so great at gathering followers? It meets them right where they are. People [on the internet at least] are generally lazy individuals who form online habits. Not everyone opens self posts for of a number of reasons:

They're new users and self posts are strange to them.

They're looking for a laugh and just want to browse images.

They sit in church on Sunday morning and looking at an image of Christpoher Hitchens with a genius quote is the only thing keeping them sane while the people around them babble in ""tongues"" and writhe on the floor.

We need a ""come as you are"" mentality, or the theists win. Deregulation needs to happen.""

So here's an alleged ""atheist,"" who is basically saying that we're not really atheists, and we hate gay people. To me, this is nothing more than saying ""Fuck you, I'm braver than you are."" How is that anything but ignorant? Literally every true atheist knows that being anti-religion = pro LGBT rights.

I'm sick of seeing these ""progressive"" Christians pretending to be atheists. They say they don't believe in gOD, but they lack bravery, so you know they're secretly worshiping a magic sky daddy. If you feel the need to mock true atheist activists for bringing up religion, you're not progressive. You're a bigot. If your reaction to bravery is a little privileged pity party for yourself, you're a bigot fundie skygoose.

1371264448.0	1gdolw	In June 2013, after jijtler overthrew skeen, I was abruptly woken in the middle of the night by two mods who subsequently threw me in a van and drove me 200 mi. to a facility that I would later find out serves the sole purpose of eliminating may-mays.	FalmerbloodElixir	155	23	9	"I hate those 2-click memes. I truly hate them. I'm really sorry you had to go through what I went... I guess I'll share my story, and hopefuly I'll make some people realize that these new policies are... more than evil.

As a kid I really denied any form of authority. I often harrased fUNDIEs on facebook, and the idea of a great man in the sky ruling over me was not only ridicoulous to me, but also hazardous... I came out to the mods as a lover of 1-click memes at the age of 14. They cried, threatened me, did everything they could to turn me back into a robot...

About 1 month after I came out, 3 mods came into my house at night, and told me to stay quiet and walk with them. I tought it was a kidnapping, as most people who experience this...

I walked into the van, and they explained themselelves. I was shocked and filled with hate, but I knew I shouldn't do anything, the van was small and I couldn't defend myself.

My first day at that new /r/atheism was horrible... everything I did was supervised, and also controlled. The only time I got to watch Cosmos and pwn fUNDIEs on facebook was at night, 10 o'clock. After 1 week I just couldn't take the 2-click memes, and my complaint posts were deleted. Two posts. Two. fucking. Posts.

After the first post I began hearing voices in my head, and after another post, the voices formed into a big, strong voice... Almost like Neil DeGrasse Tyson. I only had one conversation with it.

NDT : ""Escape.""

Me : ""How?""

NDT : ""Strong. Then Kill.""

After the last sentence I never heard him again. But it was enough. I knew my goal. At the time I had about 100 lbs... I was skinny, I didn't have force... I was helpless.

Every time I got out of isolation, I said ""fuck gOD."". All I did in isolation was drink Mountain Dew and eat Cheetos. I was so full of hate I didn't care about time... In there there was no natural light, just a little crack... I had no clock, so I would just look at the crack while pwning fUNDIEs.. Everytime light started to get through the crack, meaning it was day, it was a great achievment. I felt.. great. Small things where all I had, so it was incredible... I ate Cheetos and drank Mountain Dew Code Red in there for 8 months... breaks of 20 minutes, exercises for 1 and a half. And repeat. Repeat. Repeat...

After 8 months, I finnaly got out... everyone was so surprised I didn't shout ""fuck gOD."".

For about 4 days I was heavily looked at by all the mods... that was the day I began the brainwashing. They thought the mods deleting my complaint posts broke me down. It only made me stronger.

Everytime I entered the brainwashing room I would see a broken window. The room was on the first floor, so I could get out without too much damage. But I was... nowhere. Nowhere meaning a forest. I could run, of course, but how long would the forest last? I didn't know. Forest was memes. Memes are good. So I got to get in the forest.

One day, instead of the 5 athletic ~~mods~~ nazis that went with me to the room, there were only 2 fUNDIEs. I was so surprised... yet calm. I knew that was my day.

As I was approaching the window, I felt some Logic and Reason going down my neckbeard...

I quickly facebook pwned one guy while kicking the other with Logic and Reason, and managed to pull a Sagan quote on the facebook pwned guy.. I got ready, then jumped off the window. I fell, rolled, and managed to don't get hurt bad... I was running, running, running... I could hear some sounds, but I was so thrilled I didn't pay attention.. after about 4km running I finnaly stopped. I could feel my 1-click may-mays. It was... beautiful.

I heard a ""fuck! Watch how you're driving, man!"". My instinct moved me, and I approaced a yellow car...

""Please.. just.. let me come.""

The guy looked at me surprised, then told me to get in. After about half an hour, when I recovered, he asked me my story, but I was still afraid. What if he would get me to the mods? What if he was one of them? I didn't know. I just said ""No time to explain. Where are you going?"". He said /r/atheismrebooted.

I arrived in /r/atheismrebooted at the age of 15. I'm 19 now, and I never spoke with the ~~mods~~ nazis again, and will never do it. I truly hate jijtler.

But the experience made me realize how important 1-click memes are. .. aaaaand I grew fucking awesome muscles.

Thanks for reading so far :)! I means a lot to me that I can share my story... it hurts even now, after 4 years.

TL;DR : It took me 1 year to escape but, it takes you only 5 minutes to read.

EDIT : Thanks for all your support guys! It's been 4 years since I escaped the 2-click memes, so I had plenty of time to rebuild my neckbeard, and to find a job. I work right now as a Keyboard Warrior, Professional Quote Maker and a Meme Maker, which is more than I could have achieved while I was with new /r/atheism :)  
Anyone here gonna share his story? I figured out we could make a little book out of them, and if we would really start a petition to put skeen back as a moderator, every story counts!"	t5_2t659	True

/r/magicskyfairy  exists for a few reasons,

1)Guys, look, we are ALL prominent, brilliant Scientheists who are oppressed and horribly misunderstood in our personal lives. We're just here to VENT. 

VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. VENT. 

Our method of venting is viscerally insulting and berating every poor soul (LOL GET IT? SOUL) out there who even UTTERS a word that is tied to religion. Facebook posts, rage comics, there's no other way for us to overcome these hurdles of everyday life than huddling into a corner snickering at other people on a website.

2) We respect all people's beliefs on religion, but our goal is to convert EVERYBODY to believing what we believe because that is the only true path. God and Religion serves NO GOOD whatsoever and nobody has EVER done anything good in the name of God or religion. It completely decays our society, and offers no good incentives whatsoever. Need I remind you that Hitler was a Christian? I think that's a strong enough argument by itself.

3) America is LITERALLY a Christian theocracy/fascist regime. You saw how close we came to Rick Santorum shoving his metaphorical throbbing fairy penis down our throats. We as Atheists must speak out and be pompous douchebags otherwise the world will suffer. WHY WOULD WE BE QUIET WHEN THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH?

4) We're not really assholes in the real world, we just fucking HATE all walks of theist scum who so ignorantly post ""Thank God"" on their Facebook status. We're misunderstood when we try to spread LOGIC and REASON to the dumb-ass neanderthal knuckle-dragging fundie masses. We're not arrogant pompous social outcasts. We are NORMAL people with NORMAL social lives. We just have major insecurities and need to channel it through a perceived sense of intellectual superiority.

Basically, if you're tired of outspoken atheists, SORRY. Humanity has been held back by religion long enough, and to a point, we still are. 

We're SICK and TIRED and OUR VOICES MUST BE HEARD, AND OUR NECKBEARDS STROKED.

You may think this subreddit is full of incredible posts, that it always talks about atheism and is full of logic and reason. Fine. I won't even argue with that. The fact is, it's none of your business. Either you like this bastion of bravery and stay subscribed to it, or you don't and you unsubscribe.

The community upvotes posts that it believes ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, just like in any other subreddit. Who are you to decide what shouldn't be in there? Who are you to decide that /r/magicskyfairy aren't allowed to post things about left handedness, pickles or black pride month? Only the community and the moderators should be concerned.

As a matter of fact, I'm not speaking in the name of all /r/magicskyfairy  Only upvotes will determine if the rest of the community agrees with me or not.

We aren't responsible for  /r/magicskyfairy being the bravest subreddit, but YOU are responsible for unscribing from it if you don't like it. Don't come in our subreddit to tell us that you don't like us, this is probably the most DELUSIONAL thing you can do. 

##FUCK OFF CONCERN TROLLS!!!! DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!

Thank you.

1347553142.0	zttgu	Dear r/magicskyfairy: I was BRAVE today	meowmeow85	134	12	19	"Gather around scientists as I tell you a harrowing tale of bravery coming straight from the underground. It was lunch, I was hungry, and a SAP needs to eat. While driving I saw a popular food van, however this time it was parked at a church, A CHURCH. Let that sink in for a second. The gurgling in my gut told me I needed food though, despite downing a bag of Doritos an hour before. I had no choice, I had to go into enemy territory. 

I was in a line with about 20 people when it was my turn. The situation was tense, I was on deadly ground, the lion's den if you will, with my Cannibal Corpse shirt. I felt like a naked woman in Riyadh. My extensive military career with Battlefield 3 DLC (seriously fuck EA for making my mom pay for extra maps) has taught me that this was not a good position to be. Spawn camping wouldn't get me out of this pickle. But yea as I walk through the valley of the shadow of irrationalism I will fear no fundies for Sagan art with me. As I ordered my food I asked for some Mountain Dew. They said they only offered Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite and Fanta. My heart sunk. There was no wind in my cosmic sails. I will sail nevermore. I felt crushed, friendzoned even. 

Reluctantly I ordered a Coke and received my Devil Crab wad. I looked at it and couldn't help but feel my conviction growing. The Devil isn't real. I tasted the Devil Crab, but it turned into Chik-fil-A in my mouth. I saw the young lady that gave me the food had a cross necklace, this was the last straw. I stroked my neckbeard, wheezed to arch my shoulders and very loudly proclaimed ""MA'AM I AM AN ATHEIST"" and I threw it on the ground (LOL DAE Lonely Island).

There was a lot of confusion, left and right, I could see the glares. I asked Hitchens for strength, for my life may have been at it's end. Then the unexpected happened. A couple of people started to whistle and cheer. Others started clapping, hoopin and hollerin, even the preacher. There was a funeral being held, since I knew Science I punched the dead man right in the fucking sternum and he woke up (lol these skygeese were praying their fairy daddy would bring him back).

As I stood there with a feeling of accomplishment, the lady who gave me the ~~devil~~ crab tore off her necklace. She sensually licked the Doritos dust from my fingers and slowly went down. I motioned for a brown girl who may have been Muslim or something, who cares, she was brown. She tore off her hijab and burka thing to reveal a beautiful bellydancer who had boobs I might add. She helped lift up my gut so the first fundie could have access to my ""Rod of Reason"". After barely 15 seconds the friendzone was shattered by my explosive *LOGIC*. Though it wasn't much logic because I had been masturbating for hours in my moms basement beforehand, was pushing rope. Still it was enough logic that I could convince them to vote for Obama.

TL;DR : It took me 15 seconds to bust my load but, it takes you only 5 minutes to read.

EDIT: I told this on facebook and my fundie mom is throwing me out for  my ""poor behavior"" (i.e. BRAVERY), can I shack up with one of you? Maybe filletsack or twentyone_21?

1348849929.0	10mi3p	Dear r/magicskyfairy, today I was brave.	Nubthesamurai	123	16	20	"So I was heading home (my Mom's basement) from my local Community College when I saw a car on the side of the road. I, being the logical atheist that is good without gOD, pulled over to see if everything was alright. I was well aware that this would cut into my time that I could play League of Legends before Mom came home and made me do chores. As I pull over I notice that the car has ""I love my church"" written on the back of it. I stroke my glorious neckbeard and assume that the car may have been vandalized by some stupid fundies. I go over to the car and ask the woman in the car if there was anything I could do to help. The woman says ""Oh thank God you came. My engine died and could really use some help."" That's when I snapped. The very nerve of that brainwashed fundie shoving religion down my throat. I do what any logical atheist would do in that situation, I yell ""GOD ISN'T REAL!"" while grabbing out my personal pocket size edition of ""The gOD Delusion"" out of my gym shorts and started dropping logic bombs all over that fundie's ass. She gave me a confused look after I was finished, no doubt she couldn't handle all the unadulterated logic I threw at her. She is a fundie after all. To prove a point, I punched holes in her tires and yelled ""LET'S SEE YOUR gOD FIX THAT!"" I proceeded to drive off so I wouldn't miss anymore League of Legends time. I didn't get a good look at her as I left but I'm sure she was overwhelmed with the amount of LOGIC and REASON I threw at her.

Thanks for reading, and Sagan be with you all."	t5_2t659	True

What I miss is the vitriol! What happened to you fuckers, did you lose your teeth? Don't you remember that the word gOD is still on dollar bills? That people still say ""God Bless You"" when you sneeze? Did you know there's probably a church in the vicinity of your current location? North Carolina just turned into a fascist theocracy right under our noses! If your parents find out you're an Atheist, they can kidnap you in the middle of the night and send you to an atheist concentration camp until you're converted. (STRONG... THEN KILL) 

Now, it's this shit: [My maturity during ceremonies for other people is only surpassed by my Logic and Reason.](http://i.imgur.com/paN32.png)
Some jerk posts a rage comic, which under any other circumstance would be fucking hysterical (and the content is!) but look at them! They WENT TO A FUCKING CHURCH. Who the fuck are you guys taking part in these stupid sky daddy insane asylum rituals? Rather than taking the opportunity to laugh together and share anecdotes about all the crazy ideas theists somehow get in their heads, this smug-closet-fundie willingly went to the jaws of oppression itself. 

You've changed, r/magicskyfairy. I feel like we've grown apart. Maybe you like it that way, but I don't. I don't want to get along with everyone; I want to stand up for the truth. For Logic, Reason, Science, Carl deGrasse Sagan, and for what is right. The simple fact of the matter is that there are people who think we are going to burn forever... and we deserve it.

I'm not interested in making friends or reasoning with them. I'll happily leave you to it, though, and I promise not to interfere too much, as long as you give me the space I need, when I need it, to express myself -- even if, to do so, I must be a ""big meanie.""

1369922583.0	1fc4ee	The Braven - Edgar Allan Lewis	titan413	113	16	22	"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,  
Over many a stupid and imaginary volume of fundie lore,  
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  
'Tis another x-tian,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door -  
Only this, and nothing more.'  
    
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with a fedora and flutter,  
In there stepped a stately Braven of the logical days of yore.  
Not the least obeisance made he; his shirt read 'I'm an Atheist, debate me';  
With mien of scientist or PhD, he perched above my chamber door -  
Perched on a bust of a phony gOD just above my chamber door -  
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  
  
Then this scientist beguiling my sad faith into smiling,  
By the logical and reasonable decorum of the countenance it wore,  
'Though thy neckbeard be short and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven.  
Ghastly grim and teenage Braven waging your nightly facebook war -  
Tell me what thy enlightened name is on the Night's Gervaisian shore!'  
Quoth the Braven, 'I'm euphor'.'      
  
'Doctor!' said I, 'thing of reason! - doctor still, if you speak treason!  
By that Heaven that bends above me - by that phony gOD that I adore -  
Oh, my soul on faith's reliance, by your logical defiance,  
And your love of memes and science, has been shaken to the core,  
Sagan quotes and memes of science, shaking fundies to the core,  
Quoth the Braven, 'I'm euphor'.'    
  
'Be that word our sign of parting, doc or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -  
'Get thee back onto the internet and the Night's Gervaisian shore!  
Leave no faith smashing as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  
Leave my logical fallacies unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!  
Take thy logic from out my faith, and take thy fedora out my door!'  
Quoth the Braven, 'I'm euphor'.'    
  
And the Braven, not abating, still berating, still berating  
On the pallid bust of a phony gOD just above my chamber door;  
And his logic has all the seeming of a scientist that's dreaming,  
His own intelligence from him streaming throws his brav'ry on the floor;  
And my faith from out that brav'ry now lies smashed upon the floor  
In this moment - I'm euphor'!  "	t5_2t659	True

If we can somehow appeal to the Reddit admins to allow me to regain control of /r/atheism I assure you it be run based on its founding principles of a complete lack of control.

We know what a downfall looks like, we've seen it all too many times on the internet, which I assure you, is very serious business. This doesn't have to be one if there is something that can be done.

/r/atheism has been around for 5 years. Freedom is so strong and I always knew that if this subreddit was run in this manner, it would continue to thrive and grow, and not just because it's a default sub.

[But it's up to you. And that's the point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/)

EDIT: Never did I want to be a moderator. Everybody please petition to make me a moderator again.

EDIT 2: I'd also like to say that while I don't know an awful lot about /u/tuber - from what I've observed they always seemed to have this subreddit's best interests at heart and wanted to improve things, even though I'm actively trying to destroy what they've been working on."	t5_2t659	True
