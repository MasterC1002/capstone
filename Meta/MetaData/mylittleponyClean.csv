####Announcements

&amp;nbsp;

###12/11/12 - Guide taken down

So! What has happened to the guide you may ask.

Well, I was contacted by the reddit admins that they received a DMCA takedown notice from Hasbro on the guide itself. This was very unexpected, as reddit itself is not hosting any content, and these are only links. Linking to copyrighted content is very much a legal gray area. There have been some court cases on the matter, ruling in both directions, and especially against when the violator is turning a large profit off of it. To reiterate, this guide has never had any financial gain associated with it whatsoever, offers for donations were always prompted to going into supporting the show by buying the episodes.

Hasbro as a toy company, has not traditionally sought out DMCA claims, and they only seem to react when it's reported directly to them. What I will say is that the guide has been up for two years, and it's suspicious that it's taken down now.

**That's okay, though. There are many places to get the episodes online for those of you who don't have the legal means to watch. Go to ponyship.tk, or google 'yayponies' for more information.**

&amp;nbsp;

Signing out for now, 

RainbowCrash

&amp;nbsp;

P.S Do not worry about me, by the way. I am not in any legal trouble. They just wanted the links removed is all.

1352724882.0	1326sv	Unable to watch the S3 premier and probably never will, but I would still like to say thank you for this amazing ride.	Adween	3114	1256	409	"**EDIT: I can understand why people don't believe this, and I don't really care. I understand it's the internet and you don't beleive everything you read, fine by me. But do you really think you know a person just from a few comments they made? Stop deluding yourselves. If I wanted internet points, I would have posted her pictures or her hospital room filled with MLP merchandise. I'm not going to provide proof. I'm not going to fall to your level.**

**EDIT: Thank you for your kind words everyone. I just got back from work and decided to check this and it has over 200 comments. I'm at a loss for words. I might not be able to reply to all of them, but I promise you I'll read them all. Thank you everyone.**

Hello Reddit. I still haven't watched the Season 3 premier. A reason for this is because a friend of mine, we would watch each episode together religiously, passed away on Friday. I knew she was very sick and she didn't have much time left but she still promised to watch the premier with me. She couldn't fulfill that promise.

Today, I got an email from her sister and with her permission I would like to share it with you guys.

&gt;Dear Adrian,
&gt;
&gt;First off I want to say that spending time with you has been a blast. Ever since you introduced me to MLP:FiM I was able to endure the long and boring nights in the hospital. Thank you for that. Every week I would be so excited when a new episode comes out that I could hardly fall asleep. It was also partly because you would come and see me. The doctors said it was bad for me, but I couldn't help myself. I didn't tell you this because I knew you would stop coming, but I knew that being curled up next to you while we watch MLP was the best medicine that no doctor can give.
&gt;
&gt;When you first told me about it I was skeptical. I mean, come on, it's ponies, but it seems like you really enjoyed it so I gave it a try. After the first few episodes I was hooked too. The smile you gave me when I admitted that I loved the show made me smile too. We both found solace from this show. Cancer for me and depression for you. I guess you could say we complete each other, like how two broken pieces can create a whole even if it is mismatched. I knew it wouldn't last long though. We were near the end of Season 2 and there were no more episodes left. I felt sad that it was over. Watching the show gave me an escape from reality and it was over. I wanted to tell you to come back the next day but I didn't, I didn't want to come off as someone selfish. But I didn't have to; you came back the next day too. You showed me Reddit's r/mylittlepony. I enjoyed their drawings and the community; you gave me back the magic. You even showed me FiMFiction for stories the fan wrote.
&gt;
&gt;You kept coming back again and again, showing me new MLP stuff. Your drawings and even reading some of your own stories. You even offered to rewatch the series again, and I said yes. Truthfully though, the second time we watched it, I wasn't even watching. I just wanted to be near you, to see your face, to feel your warmth. Sometimes I would pretend to fall asleep so that you would put your arms around me. Or I would quietly sneak glances in the corner of my eye to memorize your face. And no matter what people say, you're beautiful. I never got the courage to tell you that, but you were braver than me. You would tell me things all the time. Things that made my day better.
&gt;
&gt;You would tell me that I looked beautiful even though I had tubes coming out of me. You would tell me I'm going to be fine even though we both know I won't. You would tell me that you were always going to be here for me even though that's impossible. You would tell me that my drawings and stories were good even though it couldn't compare to yours. You would tell me that Rarity is the best pony, even though Applejack is the best.
&gt;
&gt;You would tell me all of these things, but you never told me what I want to hear the most. You didn't love me, at least not the way I love you. I thought I was over you but you kept coming back. I never told you this in person so I'll write it.
&gt;
&gt;I love you. I really, really love you. So, so much. I never stopped loving you. When you rejected me back in high school I was hurt and tried to get over it, but I guess I didn't. I knew you didn't see me like that, but I could. And it didn't stop me from loving you. It might sound creepy but I learned a lot about you. I knew you had a rough childhood. I knew why you didn't have any friends. I knew that you hide behind your smile. I knew why you have that scar on your face. I knew all these things but I still love you.
&gt;
&gt;I'm going to miss our weekly discussion. I'm going to miss our small arguments on who's the best pony. I'm going to miss your drawings. I'm going to miss your stories. I'm going to miss you. I can't say it enough, but I'll miss you. 
&gt;
&gt;I wish that I wasn't sick. I wish that I could grow old. I wish that I could start a family. I wish that I could introduce my kids to the show. I wish that you could stay here by my side, watching our favourite show together, forever.
&gt;
&gt;I know I promised to watch the Season 3 premier with you, but I honestly think I won't make it. So I want you to have something. My Applejack plushie. I want you to take it with you whenever you watch an episode, so I can be with you. Remember to make those comments that I love hearing on each episode. Pretend that whenever you talk to Applejack, you're talking to me.
&gt;
&gt;There are a lot of things I want to tell you but I won't have enough time. There is one though that you should know. I hope you beat your depression. I won’t be able to beat my cancer, I know that and you do too.  But maybe you can beat your illness. I know you can. Every time we watch an episode, I wouldn't focus on the show at all. I would just look at you, and I can see that you truly enjoyed it. Use it to find a new meaning in life. Be a new person, go out, and make new friends that will understand you. You can do it. You were able to help me through a rough time and I can't repay you but just give you my words and I hope it's enough.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly I want to end this letter just like the letters the mane six write at the end of every episode. I guess you could say this is my last episode so it seems appropriate. So here's what I learned:
&gt;
&gt;That friendship truly is magic.
&gt;
&gt;Your best friend,
&gt;
&gt;Lisa

She loved to browse r/mlp just as much as she loved watching the show. I want to say thank you for everything. From your drawings, your stories, even the weekly discussion. Thank you.

I still can't watch S3 because it still hurts, but when I do, I'll have my Applejack plushie with me. Once again, thank you.

1348499587.0	10e8c6	MLP got me commended at work!	Worldtrekka	1700	521	184	"Quick background: I am a dental student and as part of the curriculum I had to spend a week in a very rural part of my state, assisting senior dental students.  This is a VERY poor area and most of the people who come in have serious dental issues.

Story:  First appointment of the morning and I am assisting a pediatric dental resident.  The resident complains about the kid that we are about to see because last week the kid couldn't make it through the procedure.  The kid needs 2 baby teeth extracted because they are impeding the progress of her permanent teeth coming in.

The kid arrives and it is a little girl with a rainbow dash shirt on.  On the inside, I do a little dance because it is MLP (duh).  This girl, lets call her Emily, is incredibly shy and doesn't want to get in the chair.  We manage to get her into the chair, but then she won't use laughing gas because she stand the smell.  The pediatric resident steps out of the room with her mom to have a talk about what to try next, leaving Emily and I alone.

As I am changing my gloves, I ask her who her favorite pony is and she looks at me and grumpily replies ""Rainbow Dash"".  I tell her ""Do you think Rainbow Dash would be afraid to go to the dentist?  RD wasn't afraid of the doctor when she broke her wing."" She replies ""Yeah, well I'm not as cool as RD."" 

Me: ""Well, even Fluttershy, who is afraid of almost everything, will face her fears when it is really important.""  

Emily: ""I guess so..."" 

Me: ""Even Pinkie Pie says that we have to face our fears""

Emily: ""Well...""

Me: ""Emily, you can do it, I believe in you.""


She tells me ok and then proceeds to hold my hand with a vice like grip.  She still refuses laughing gas, but the resident pulls both teeth with only a local anesthetic (gum numb, no shots!).  As someone who has watched grown men cry when shot up with oodles of anesthetic, I couldn't believe the courage of this little kid.

We brohoof as she walks out and the pediatric resident can't believe that I got the kid to do the procedure.  When she asks me how I did it, I told her that we talked about her favorite show, MLP.  She then asks me how I know so much about it, and I chicken out and tell her that I watch it when I babysit my niece (I don't have a niece).  Doesn't matter though because she is really happy and tells the head of the clinic about it and I got some serious brownie points.  Basically MLP is awesome.



**TLDR**:  I helped a little girl through a tough dental procedure with my knowledge of MLP and got commended for it."	t5_2s8bl	True

Fromkas	1977	806	534	"So I was attending Cloudsdale Congress (Still am) and decided to go get some fresh air and maybe some food, so I drove off for a little bit and went to a little corner store in old town. Now, I was all dressed up in a duster and a blue suit, I had slicked my hair back to resemble Dr. Whooves (Or tennant, but I was aiming for the pony for obvious reasons.) When I got there I saw a girl who must have been cosplaying, for what event I don't know. She was blonde, wearing yellow contacts (or was born with yellow iris') a grey shirt and pants with little bubble shapes on her upper thigh. I walked over to her, grabbed her on the shoulders and said ""Ditzy, come with me, I need you!"" She instinctively pulled away an kinda freaked out ""Who... Who are you?"" She asked, it was evident she was scared. ""It's me, The Doctor! Time Turner! We adventured together all the time!"" I couldn't help but laugh a little at the pun. ""She started hesitating ""Do... Doctor?"" 

""Yes! That's me!""

She was finally catching on and threw her arms around me and drew me in for a hug ""Oh Doctor! What happened, why are we walking on... Two legs? And where are my wings?"" She said, patting her back. ""The TARDIS must have malfunctioned again and brought us back to my universe, but this doesn't look like England..."" 

She started blinking and said, while starting to cross her eyes ""What are you waiting for? Let's explore!"" 

I started grinning and yelled ""That's the spirit Derpy! Avante!"" I yelled as I grabbed her hand and ran out as she said ""My name's Dit- Ah whatever.""

Many high fives followed and she gave me her number."	t5_2s8bl	True

Employee doesn't want to sell My Little Pony for Xmas for a little boy. 	zyrphir	1703	551	572	"From a friend's FB wall: ""Just came home from Toys'R'Us filled with rage. My two-year-old has been asking for a pony for Christmas every day for weeks now, so I went to find him a My Little Pony or equivalent. When I couldn't find what I was looking for, I asked a clerk if she could show me where the ponies are and mentioned that my son really wants one. 

She immediately got in my face about how he doesn't want a pony because they're a girl toy and that I should buy him a teddy bear instead. I repeated that he's been asking for Santa to bring him a pony every day, I was not interested in a teddy bear, and to please direct me to the ponies. She went on to argue and insist that I was wrong for about 5 minutes, and REFUSED to show me where the ponies were.

I told her that children's toys are not operated by their genitals and therefore EVERY toy is gender neutral. I then angrily ranted at her manager and another employee was kind enough to show me where the ponies were. Finally I was able to select 2 ponies for my son, who I can assure you will be thrilled to play with them. Almost an hour later, I am still steaming mad.""

Sure, she eventually got the ponies. But really, Toys-R-Us? You hire staff to enforce what they see as gender roles, and *refuse* to show people toys based on their own small-mindedness? (This was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, theoretically a liberal-minded city.)

Personally, I'm having a hard time not returning the Xmas presents that I bought from ToysRUs and attempting to find replacements elsewhere, despite the hassle."	t5_2s8bl	True

Pathogen-David	1408	409	522	"[](/b25) Recently, we had a [three-part charity competition](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/100178/benders_vs_bronies_final_results/) with /r/thelastairbender. Since we were both in-between seasons, we thought this would be a fun way to reinvigorate the communities, and do some good. We teamed up with the reddit admins, and together the idea really took off.

* Together, we managed to gather nearly **[150 years](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12)** of computing time [for the World community Grid phase](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/ypcln/benders_vs_bronies_charity_challenge_part_1/) (a distributed computing grid for sustainable projects, such as cancer research).

* We also raised **[over $33,000](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/rmylittleponys-fundraising-page)** (combined) for Doctors/Engineers without Borders for the [donation phase](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/zgere/benders_vs_bronies_charity_competition_part_3/).

**Why is the logo different?** The Reddit admins awarded it to us as a prize for winning the competition. It was designed by [/u/Leiden](http://www.reddit.com/user/Leiden), our [art phase](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/z3cct/benders_vs_bronies_challenge_part_2_art/) contest [winner](http://i.imgur.com/9T9Bn.png).

**Who is the pony in the logo?** Karma (the pony in the header) is the official mascot of /r/mylittlepony, and is a pony version of Snoo, the reddit alien.

**Why ponies?** You may be wondering about the show, and why it’s so popular currently online. We were confused too, until we watched it. It’s just a simple, fun show that transcends the expected demographic (think Pixar). Have more questions about it? See [this FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/np48q/why_do_we_watch_ponies_faq/).

**Why are you forcing ponies on us?** To make this 100% clear, **our intention here is not to force ponies on you.** People have different tastes, and that’s okay. We simply hoped to give some sort of shared-reward for the winner."	t5_2s8bl	True

I usually allow them to pick what they want to watch by voting, however if one child doesn’t get a show they want for a while I’ll let that child pick. Last night I had a group of five girls and one boy. The girls were bent on watching very girly shows. The one boy asked me very nicely if we could watch a “boy show”. Figuring he had quite nicely endured Strawberry Short Cake, as well as other such shows I was willing to let him pick a “boy show”. I asked him which show he’d like and he replied “The horse one” I told him there where many horse shows. Which one would you like? I couldn’t help but smile when the “boy show” he pointed to was My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. For the rest of the night we had a mini MLP FIM marathon. Best night ever. 	t5_2s8bl	True

There was actually a double meaning in the song. The song is in the key of Db Major (just like winter wrap up!) . That means that the root chord is a Db major chord. Usually, a Ab major chord will lead into a Db major. This is the V-I chord progression and it is also known as the Authentic Cadence (stick with me here). Now, it seems to resolve to a sadder chord at the end of the phrase. Instead of ending on Db major around 1:16, it lands on Bb minor: the relative minor of Db major. Now, when a chord progression seems to be heading to the root chord but lands on the relative minor instead, that is called a...

Deceptive Cadence


edit: After arguing with a few people in the comments (2), I think I have to clarify what I meant with this post. It's not supposed to be a mind-blowing revelation, it's just a little observation that makes the song a bit more enjoyable. While I don't think it was the point of the song to foreshadow that Cadence was a fake, I do think that having the deceptive cadence in the end was a cute little joke. It's clever but it's not serious.

When I made this post, I had come home from a failed job at Disneyworld in Florida. I was a costumer there, and although I knew I wouldn't be doing real costuming, what I've been trained to do for about 12 years, I was NOT expecting to be working in a warehouse, organizing uniforms, with no sunlight and no co-workers my age, and Dolores Umbridge as my boss. I came home after only two months, feeling like an absolute failure, and unsure if I could ever make my sewing a career. Heck, at that point, I was so depressed, I was scared I would NEVER find my calling. 

And then I made my Rainbow Dash hoodie, and BOOM! this community single-handedly helped jump-start my small, handmade business that has been my dream since I was 16! The support, compliments, and suggestions gave me the drive to get everything started up and running, and now I'm so busy making hoodies for all of my bronies, that I barely have time for anything else, but I'm soooooo happy!! I'm even doing a fashion show in the fall!

That was my first post on Reddit, and I really thought the internet was a mean mean place, but you guys have been nothing but loving and caring, and full of passion, which I love! 

All I can say is thank you. Thank you thank you thank you! Which doesn't even cut it! :D I love you guys, internet-forum-full-of-strangers, because you're awesome! 

I know my little business could get shut down at any moment due to copyright, but I will love and cherish this little business I have for as long as it lasts, and make a hoodie for every Brony who wants one :D 

If you want to see how much I've progressed because of you guys, you can see all of the crazy hoodies I've made here: http://theflyingpanda08.deviantart.com/gallery/

EDIT: Because of your awesomeness, I have reached 200 watchers on my Deviantart, which means I'm giving away a free fleece hoodie!! Here's direct link to the contest: http://theflyingpanda08.deviantart.com/#/d56q02f
Gah! Yay!

EDIT: As always, you guys are awesome! I wanted to share my story so that you realize that even a little compliment can make someone's dreams come true. Your comments here are blowing my mind :D Thank you!"	t5_2s8bl	True

1345741218.0	ypcln	Benders vs. Bronies Charity Challenge, Part 1	Snivian_Moon	1278	407	1010	"Attention pony fans, stalwart friends, and all readers of /r/mylittlepony!     
&amp;nbsp;  
  
[](/rrdsalute ""Bronies, report in!"")  Today we face a challenge. A challenge greater than any put forth to our subreddit in days past!  
  
Months ago, the subscriber count of /r/TheLastAirbender surpassed that of /r/mylittlepony, and to date has continued to exceed it. In response to this event, the moderators of TLA put forth a challenge to us, the pony fans. ""Our members are much more amazing than yours,"" they purported, ""and we want to prove it."" Of course, we here at /r/mylittlepony couldn't simply dismiss a challenge of this magnitude. Besides that, we know that *you*, the readers of this subreddit, are the most amazing bunch of people on reddit! As such, we've accepted their challenge, and we intend to show them the true meaning of the term 'friendly competition'!  
  
[](/louder ""Gotta show them our determination!"") Over the course of the next few weeks, the competition will unfold in three phases. Each phase will be revealed in turn, and all of them will contribute to an overall, weighted point total. The subreddit with the most points at the end of the competition will win! Win what, you might ask? [](/sp)   
  
[](/rdsitting ""That's an AWESOME prize!"") The winning subreddit will be awarded an amazing opportunity, courtesy of the reddit administrators themselves. Whoever comes out ahead in the contest will be allowed to create the **reddit header logo** for the *entire site* for a day, *plus* the privilege of replacing a sidebar ad in the same manner! There will also be additional prizes given out at the subreddit level for all those who participate in any event (those details will be forthcoming).    
&amp;nbsp;  

####Competition Details:  
&amp;nbsp;  

Though the entire competition will have several ways to participate, the initial phase will involve the **[World Community Grid](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/)**. The WCG is a distributed computing project, which allows users to invest their unused computing power toward solving important, world-impacting problems. This part of the competition will last the longest, starting **right now** and lasting until **Sunday the 16th of September**.   
&amp;nbsp;    

**[UPDATE: Please read this FAQ! It answers some common questions about the contest!](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/ywjf9/bvb_update_post_and_faq/)**  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
####How to participate:  
&amp;nbsp;    
    
Participating in this portion of the competition is simple! First, visit the World Community Grid **[sign up](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do)** page and make an account. (**EDIT**: For quicker and easier links to sign up *and* join a team simultaneously, use these links: Team **[Benders](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=JDSTCB5H12)** and team **[Bronies](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=JDSTCB5H12)**. Using these links to sign up will make an account and affiliate you with your team of choice). After signing up you'll be asked which projects you wish to work on, and you may choose any projects you want (working on *any* WCG project is okay, so long as you are working for the right team). Afterward, download the latest client software for your OS from [this page](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php) (Choose the latest stable recommended release).    
  
If you wish to, you can choose to allow the WCG use your GPU as well as your CPU for computations. To do this, look at the bottom of the project selection page on the WCG webpage while logged in, and select [this checkbox](http://i.imgur.com/zt1lm.jpg). Note that while this will improve performance, it may also use additional power and generate additional heat.    
  
Once the Boinc Manager is installed, launch the program. After logging in, you will again be asked which *project* you wish to attach to. Note that this is distinct from the previous question you answered on the WCG website. In this instance, you need to tell the Boinc Manager that you wish to participate in the World Community Grid, so select ""Attach to a Project"" and then select ""World Community Grid"" from the provided list. So long as the Boinc Manager is now running, you are donating your computer power to the WCG project. Be sure to look at the preferences and settings to ensure that you aren't slowing down your computer during times when you wish to use it fully.   
&amp;nbsp;   
  
####Choosing a team:
&amp;nbsp;   
    
Next, and **most importantly**, sign back in to the WCG site, so as to join the team wish to participate in. All hours of computation you produce will count toward this team's total in the competition, but only if you are a member of said team! Be sure that you've joined the team you wish to support! To join a team, visit the appropriate page linked below while logged in, and under the 'Team Control Panel' heading, click 'Join this Team'.  
   
**Benders** should join team **[reddit avatars](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=DDSTCB5H12)**  
**Bronies** should join team **[r/mylittlepony - Official MLP:FIM reddit community](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12)**  
  
And that's it! Now so long as you keep the Boinc Manager running in the background, all the computations your computer generates will count toward the total WCG points of your group.  
  
At the end of the competition, whichever WCG team has accrued the most computation time to the WCG will get 45 points. The losing community will net a percentage of 45 points equal to their WCG hours compared to the winner's total (For example, if the loser accrues a number of hours equal to 75% of the winner, they will earn 34 points). reddit Gold and other goodies will be given out randomly to those that participate, even if you can only give one hour! We'll let you know more about those giveaways toward the end of the contest. The WCG portion of this competition will be the longest running section, and one that we hope everyone can and will participate it.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
####Could you repeat that?    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
In brief, to participate:  
`1`. Make a new account on the **[WCG website](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do)**. Choose projects, and select if you wish to [use your GPU](http://i.imgur.com/zt1lm.jpg) as well as your CPU. 
**EDIT**: To sign up and join a team simultaneously, use the following links for team **[Benders](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=DDSTCB5H12)** or for team **[Bronies](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=JDSTCB5H12)**.  
`2`. **[Download](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php)** and install the software. Make sure it's associated with the WCG.  
`3`. On the WCG website, make sure you are joinied up with either the **[Benders](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=DDSTCB5H12)** team or the **[Bronies](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12)** team.  
`4`. Let the Boinc manager run, and rack up computation time for your team!  
&amp;nbsp;    
  
####Final Notes:
&amp;nbsp;     
 
In the coming weeks, we will unveil two additional aspects of the Benders vs. Bronies competition, which will entail a **charity drive** and an **art contest** (With the art contest to be judged by the reddit admins themselves). The specifics of these endeavors will be revealed when the time is right, but until then, please sign up for the WCG and let's get this party started!

[](/rdsalute) Citizens of /r/mylittlepony, our own kind is in need of each other now more than ever. Let's do our job and help out how we can.

As always, you can [donate to Red Cross Disaster Relief.](http://www.redcross.org/charitable-donations) You can text the word ‘REDCROSS’ to 90999 to make a $10 donation. You can also go out and donate blood to Red Cross for victims, as over 100 blood drives have been canceled due to the hurricane. But even here, there are things you can help do.

/r/MyLittleSupportGroup is a subreddit for bronies to get help and help out. If you are affected in a way where you need support from your brony friends, come visit.

/r/MyLittleCouchSurf is a new subreddit for bronies who need a place to stay. If your home is damaged, **or more importantly, if you have a place for affected bronies to stay that you can offer,** come join the subreddit.

Even if you can't offer a room, there is still ways you can help. Keep /r/mylittlepony and /r/MLPLounge full of kindness and laughter. The warm atmosphere of this community is enough to help people get through the night, even if only a small amount. Be a friend, check on your friends who may be affected and do what you can.

And as always, post ponies!

Good luck to everyone. Be safe, be smart.

Then he proceeds to ask me if Rainbow Dash was indeed my favorite pony and I said ""No, Fluttershy is.""  Then he says that Fluttershy is his favorite too.  At this point I am sort of confused but also surprised and happy.  

So in the end he decides to only give me a warning and we exchanged brohoofs before parting ways.  Best $25 I spent on a shirt ever, and also its amazing how cool people from the MLP community are!

[] (/colgate) Edit: The posts so far have made me laugh and cry, also i'm glad you enjoyed my story 

[] (/flutteryay) 2nd Edit:  Just got back from taking a nap after two long test days and some projects due for college.... (Also was playing some dota 2)  But I am surprised at the number of people that commented on this and upvoted / downvoted it.  Especially considering this was my first post on this subreddit... (I'm a shy pony unforunately)  Anyways you guys are awesome ! :)

[](/twipride ""There's so much here to be proud of!"") It's hard to believe that over three weeks have passed since the start of our friendly contest with the subscribers of /r/TheLastAirbender. We've gone through three different competitions in that time, and at every turn your enthusiasm, generosity, and dedication have been nothing short of overwhelmingly impressive! Between both subreddits, you've all accrued more than 147 *years* of donated CPU time for the World Community Grid, over *$33,000* in donations to the Without Borders programs, and generated tons of impressive and fun art! No matter who claims victory in the competition, the charities that benefit from these contributions are the real winners.   
  
[](/twibeam ""Thank you all so much!"") Before we move on to the final results, we'd like to take a moment to thank each and every one of *you* for being a part of this event. Whether you helped to crunch numbers, contributed to the donation drive, created art, or just lent your moral support to the rest of the team, *thank you all* for what you've done. It's nothing short of stunning what's happened here, and we're positively overjoyed to see how it all turned out. [](/sp)   
  

[](/twismile ""Time to get to the numbers!"") And so, without further delay we present to you: The Results! [](/sp)  
####World Community Grid   
The [World Community Grid project](http://redd.it/ypcln) kicked off on August 23rd, and came to a close this evening at ~6:30 PM PDT. In that time, over 125 years of CPU power were donated to a variety of research projects all over the world. Thank you everyone for participating.   
  
Sometime soon we will be doing random drawings for those who participated, and handing out reddit gold to those selected. What was achieved here was positively amazing, and we hope all of you will continue to use the program even now with the contest finished.    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
At the end of the competition, [the totals](http://i.imgur.com/OeSA1.png) are as follows:  
  
*  The **Bronies** contributed a total of 124 years, 257 days, 16 hours, 25 minutes, and 35 seconds, winning this portion of the contest to earn **45** points (Note that this time has been adjusted by three days to account for an accidental head start).  
  
*  The **Benders** contributed a total of 23 years, 13 days, 4 hours, 45 miuntes, and 22 seconds, earning themselves **9** (18% of 45, rounded up) points.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
This was a tremendous effort from all parties involved, and we thank you for it. Please, though, don't let the close of the contest make you feel as if you should stop contributing! Our [WCG team](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/team/viewTeamInfo.do?teamId=JDSTCB5H12) will be continuing to compute far into the future, and we now actively encourage everyone to spread the word and participate. Feel free to tell anyone and everyone you wish! Let's see if we can't keep the ball rolling.   
  
####Fundraiser

After an exciting [ten days of charitable donations](http://redd.it/zgere) the final results are in! The totals amounts collected by Crowdtilt are as follows:  
&amp;nbsp; 
  
*  The **Bronies** team donated a total of $25,299.00, winning the contest and netting **40** points.  
  
*  The **Benders** team contributed a total of $8,065.42, earning themselves **13** (32% of 40) points.
&amp;nbsp;  
  
We are amazed at these numbers. You guys really pulled through here and did a fantastic job. The 'Without Borders' organizations will be grateful for this donation. Remember that the 'Without Borders' organizations work to better the people of the world, regardless of nationality or race. Many of these workers put themselves in real danger in order to promote the health of humanity.  
  
Please rest assured that prizes will be distributed very soon! We are still waiting for the final donation breakdowns in terms of contributors, and as such it may take us some time to contact everyone. However, we promise that the prize winners will be determined soon, and that they will be contacted via email. **Please be sure to monitor your CrowdTilt email address**. If a winner does not respond to our contact attempts within 24 hours, we will be forced to redraw a different name.  
  
####Art Contest  
  
There was a positively *huge* amount of phenomenal and wonderful artwork submitted for [this portion](http://redd.it/z3cct) of the contest. It was not only impressive, but it made it very hard to choose a winner at all!  
  
To see all of the entires, see [this page](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/znnh3/art_contest_submissions/) for the art submitted to the **Benders** team, and [this page](http://rmlp.pathogenstudios.com/bvbart/) for the art submitted to the **Bronies** team.   
  
After much consideration, the reddit administrators chose their winner from both subs:  
&amp;nbsp;  

*  The winner for the Bender team was [/u/PancakeBear](http://www.reddit.com/user/PancakeBear) for [Korra Snoo-sledding](http://i.imgur.com/b8zBp.png).   
  
*  The winner for the Brony team was [/u/Leiden](http://www.reddit.com/user/Leiden) for [Pinkie's New Friend](http://i.imgur.com/9T9Bn.png).  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
And the overall winner of the art contest, as selected by the admins, is...  
  
.

.  
  
**[/u/PancakeBear](http://www.reddit.com/user/PancakeBear)** and **[Korra Snoo-sledding](http://i.imgur.com/b8zBp.png)** for the Benders team! Congratulations [/u/PancakeBear](http://www.reddit.com/user/PancakeBear) for winning, and earning 15 points for the Benders. Congratulations also to [/u/Leiden](http://www.reddit.com/user/Leiden) who won runner-up, earning the Bronies 8 points.

Congratulations to the Bronies team for winning the overall competition! Art for the header and sidebar will be awarded to /r/mylittlepony, as designed by [/u/Leiden](http://www.reddit.com/user/Leiden) (if Leiden so chooses). More details will be forthcoming soon, pending communication with the reddit admins.  

**EDIT**: As the question has come up often, please note that as of now **we're not sure when the banner and ad will be live**. We're still waiting on word from the administrators, and obviously Leiden needs some time to create, as well. If we're given a time table and permission to share it, we'll certainly make a post to let you all know. In the meantime, just look forward to it as a special treat somewhere on the horizon! You've all earned it, and we're proud of you beyond measure.     
  
Thank you to everyone and anyone who participated, on either side of the contest. This has been a tremendous event, and we've all worked together to make something great happen. You should all be proud of yourselves, and proud of the people you were competing against, as well.

1368131441.0	1e0vd0	My friend is missing and I don't know what to do	vindictive_rarity	1173	353	204	"I don’t know why I’m telling you all about this but a friend of mine has been missing for hours now and I don’t know what to do.
 
She’s an old teacher of mine that kept in touch over the years, and I know this sounds kind of weird, but she’s like family and I love her to death. I was supposed to meet her in this stupid little town for a festival the locals throw every year and now nobody can find her anywhere. I didn't even want to go to this stupid thing in the first place, but she insisted I go out and try to meet people instead of sitting at home reading.
 
She doesn't have a cell phone because she insists on communicating with nothing but handwritten mail. That seems kind of outdated, right? Anyway, it's our thing and I humor her because I think it's funny but now it's a serious problem because nobody can get ahold of her. 
 
The police are a complete non-entity out in this backwater shit hole and I’m afraid of what will happen to her by the time the any real search gets underway. I need some serious advice because I think I know who did it.
 
There are some others I met who also think some messed up shit went down and we're about to go out looking for some answers.

Most people don't know it, but my friend has a pretty fucked up past and I think it finally caught up with her. She's got this psychotic younger sister that absolutely hates her guts. I only mention this because she showed up at the party tonight and said some threats that leads me to believe she has something to do with it.

So anyway, the only way to stop her younger sister is by using these artifacts called the Elements of Harmony, but we have no idea where to find them or if they even still exist."	t5_2s8bl	True

**This warning would work best if repeated elsewhere. spread the news around if you can.**

[Reposting from EqD](http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/06/warning-tlc-my-crazy-obsession-seeks.html)

&gt;**""**I don't usually post things like this.  You are all free to enjoy pony however you wish, and talk to whoever you want about it.  Enough people have convinced me that a small warning would do us all some good in this case though.

&gt;A show called My Crazy Obsession is sending a reporter around looking for someone with a huge pony collection.  They are visiting various forums/communities hoping to find the perfect target, dropping messages similar to this:

&gt;&gt;*Hi Everybody!*

&gt;&gt;*I am casting a show for TLC about people with unique collections or obsessions. I found this forum and wanted to get in touch with anybody who has the most amazing My Little Pony collection to see if they'd be interested in sharing their story on our show. Please shoot me an email if this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of. Hope to hear from some of you!*  


&gt;My Crazy Obsession has never been about showing people in a positive light. The crazier the better. It makes good TV, we can't blame them for that!  If you do own a larger than average pony collection, I would recommend avoiding it like the plague though.  I might even run a ""show off your pony collection"" event in the near future if you want to brag.

&gt;Again, it's up to you!  This was just to give you guys an idea on what exactly the show is.**""**

There is nobody normal enough to not be made out to look like a freak by these people. These shows bank off people who think they can ""give other like them a good name""

if you're thinking of taking them up on this offer for the sake of making the fans look good, don't. they are masters at the art of making people look like degenerates. 

**edit:** If you aren't from around the states, Xyro further elaborates this show to illustrate how serious this is:

&gt;This warning is more serious than it sounds, guys. These shows are there SPECIFICALLY to make the target look as abnormal as possible, with the goal of shunning them from society. No matter how good or normal you are, the wonders of editing can make even the best of people look like a freakshow. 

For an example of one of the more mild examples from this show, [take this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF8eHuQuR1o) where they make an incredibly talented and passionate artist look like a madwoman who is off her meds and implies she is a danger to actual children. 

This is a MILD example of what this show can do. some will throw in elements like music to make the person seem even more deviant."	t5_2s8bl	True
