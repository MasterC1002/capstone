1356810116.0	15mwsb	Hello /r/socialengineering, I posted this originally in /r/confession, but they felt it would fit in better here. WARNING: Wall of text, but worth the read!	tweakofnature	546	104	136	"When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account… all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of ""stealing is wrong"" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this:

* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.
3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting.
* During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.
* Once completed I would do a ""fake transaction"" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.
* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my ""bag"" at a later time.

This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.

At the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking ""problem solver"" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. 

Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared ""Cash or credit"", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.

My General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. 

So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked.  I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. 

You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.

Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to ""crack."" One of the most commonly used techniques is the ""Loaded Question Tactic."" I will attempt to explain:

A loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda.

Example:

The question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded.

Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers:
	1. ""Yes, I have stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I was beating my wife.""
	2. ""No, I haven't stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I am still beating my wife.""
	
The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say ""I have never beaten my wife."" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me.

October 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. 

At the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report… he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get ""yelled at and it would blow over."" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said ""No."" But it wasn't a suspicious ""no."" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.

The sub has no FAQ, the mods are unresponsive, and every couple weeks we have people looking for beginner tools. 

I have a decade+ experience myself, time spent in this sub, learning new things from everyone, teaching others, and I've read all manner of books on the subject, and I can say first hand that **I can't do this alone.**

/r/SocialEngineering, lets get some ideas and recommended sources put together, huh? My goal end product is in three parts.

I'd like to write a document to serve as an unofficial course text for beginners, organized into sections going from such basic things as just talking to people and being social in the first place, ending with simple methods of winning people over. Each section will have activities of some kind to complete, testing each specific new skill. For this first document, its gonna be incredibly simple. Kindergarten of Social Interactions. 

My goal for the second part is a document that is beginner oriented, and will feature the basics of social manipulations. Going over questioning, FORM, pretext, etc the whole bag yadda yadda yadda. The activities and tests in this one will focus on a goal outside of the interaction itself. Information, a name, something. But real beginner level. I'd love to cite historical instances here. 

The advanced document is one I hope can be for serious Social Engineers, Pentesters, and perhaps even elite sales people. I'd like it to cover both social principles and psychological laws that govern social interactions. The activities here would challenge people to take their knowledge of these ideas and principles into consideration as well and perhaps develop their own tactics, strategies, and such.

Last, and most certainly not least, I'd love to create a video companion to each one and I'd love to make these free resources.


These won't be complete, as social engineering is as ever changing and growing as the human population. I hope that with the help of this sub reddit, we can realize this soon. Here's my call to action: if there is an idea you have now, give it out. Everyone involved will be credited unless the indicate otherwise. Give any and all ideas. What information goes where? How do we format it? Who is in the videos? Any skills to contribute? Is this a shitty idea? Let me know.

Now for each dock there is a gate with a passcode lock that is different for each gate. Now the first time I noticed this was a little over a year ago when I was walking up to my gate struggling to hold a cooler and someone ran over to open the gate for me. Now each section is very large so while at first I thought maybe they just recognized me, I realized that was unlikely. Since then if I ever want to just walk up and down the other docks for whatever reason, all I have to do is carry a cooler and if someone is nearby, they will almost always come open the gate. Not sure how many times you guys will find this useful but still a pretty cool trick to know.

His findings: if a present is wrapped up very nicely, then the recipient expects something very nice and  might be disappointed when the gift doesn't measure up to expectations.  

Conversely, if you just wrap it in brown paper, the recipient will have lower expectations and will appreciate the gift more, no matter how good of a gift is.

1329930291.0	q13ux	Simple, Non-verbal Instant Rapport Technique	acepincter	169	21	40	"Thought the community might enjoy this. We know how important rapport is, and many of us are consciously aware of their level of rapport with others. The understandings behind this technique will benefit you and, in applying them, you'll soon find people drop their guard and begin to open right up within the first few minutes. And, no one will notice you doing it. (provided you're not *completely* obvious.)

To fully understand this, what you should do right now is go and stand in front of a mirror, relax, and say ""hello"" to yourself, just as you would say ""hello"" to a stranger. Notice how you move when you say it. Notice whether you say hello by smiling, nodding, raising your head, tilting your head, raising an eyebrow, winking, blinking, smirking, grinning, etc. Do you dip? Do you bow? Notice as much as you can.

Now, understand that that ""hello"" is personal to you. It's how you say it with your body. It's how you say it from afar when you recognize someone you're walking towards and want to engage. It's how you say it when it's too crowded in the club to get close enough to shout, but you need to get someone's attention. Your face is on the other side of the room, broadcasting ""Hey! Hey! Hello! Over here!""

Now that it's right in front of you, you'll begin to notice that everyone else has their own personal hello. Again, some people go chin down, some go chin up, some tilt, some bend at the knees, some pop onto their tip-toes.

Something happens when two people greet each other using the same hello. There's a hundred unspoken assumptions that all take place in a split second. (Ok, this person seems nice. Something familiar about him/her. maybe we're from the same area? We seem to have the same status, and probably have other similarities. This person seems to have a similar manner and is probably not be a threat. This person seems friendly.)

So here's how it works. When you first meet someone, shift into neutral. Forget your personal ""hello"".  Let *them* lead.

When that person gives you a ""hello"", you give back the **exact same** ""hello"". The first person will probably do it again. You do it again, too. (For some reason I don't fully understand, it usually happens twice.) Bam! You've gone from ""stranger"" to ""friendly"".

Start talking. Carry on as normal. Try to remember that hello, because, later, if you either want to get the person's undivided attention or want to reaffirm the ""friendly"" vibe, you can repeat the hello.

I guarantee, if you broadcast the person's particular ""hello"" and are in their peripheral vision, they will turn their focus to you, if only for a second.  You can engage focus from there.  

If you've done this right, you won't have to worry too much about what to say, because the other person will spill their guts like you both went to school together.

(For NLP guys, the Bam! earlier is when you should anchor a subtle eye-cue like glancing at an ear. Later, looking at the ear will effectively give you a communications channel to the person's sub-conscious, bypassing conscious objections reserved for ""strangers"".)"	t5_2qlud	True

There have been an influx of threads over the past few months that just plain suck, people asking really dumb questions, people giving bad advice, poor quality posts and good threads getting ignored.

Some examples:

So what can we do? For a while people talked about having challenges on /r/socialengineering, but when I ran some months back, they weren't all that popular and nobody followed directions.

How can we improve the quality of the posts and comments in this subreddit?

All cons, tactics, strategies and manipulations can be reduced to one of these. Often, Social Engineering attacks or con games will use more than one, but you'll find that over it reduces to one principle or multiple attacks using one principle each. It can be argued that all security attacks use these principles (for example, trojans use the deception principle).

**The distraction principle:** While you are distracted by what retains your interest, hustlers can do anything to you and you won’t notice.

**The social compliance principle:** Most civilized culture trains people to adhere to perceived societal rules. Social Engineers know how to use social pressures and our desire to fit in against out better judgement. 

**The herd principle:** Even suspicious marks will let their guard down when everyone next to them appears to share the same risks. Safety in numbers? Not if they’re all conspiring against you. 

**The dishonesty principle:** Anything illegal you do will be used against you by the fraudster, making it harder for you to seek help once you realize you’ve been had. The best cons have you doing all his/her dirty work. 

**The deception principle:** Things and people are not what they seem. Hustlers know how to manipulate you to make you believe that they are.

**The need and greed principle:** Your needs and desires make you vulnerable. Once hustlers know what you really want, they can easily manipulate you.

**The Time principle:** When you are under time pressure to make an important choice, you use a different decision strategy. Hustlers steer you towards a strategy involving less reasoning.

I have borrowed this list [from](http://www.lonegunman.co.uk/2009/12/02/seven-psychological-principles-con-artists-exploit/), with some minor corrections for accuracy (the original article, I feel, could have represented Social Compliance principle better).

I was browsing a few old posts, and I see a lot of people asking how to get staff or employees to like them, or how to get friends to like them, or strangers to like them, etc. 

The method I'm about to outline is **NOT** the only one, it is **NOT** the best, but it **IS** effective, and with some creativity, can be applied even to people you've known a long time.

I'm talking about **F.O.R.M.**

**F**amily
**O**ccupation
**R**ecreation
**M**essage

When meeting someone new, or when trying to make friends (or rekindling old friendships), and knowing that people love to talk about themselves, here are some areas we all have common ground.

**FAMILY**

Whether we have a family, love our family, hate our family, or share a family, we all have an opinion on it. Families can be motivators, they can be stressors, they can be a great many types of stimuli on a person. Talking about your family can be a great ice-breaker, and timed with a great question, can get your new friend talking for hours. 

**OCCUPATION**

This covers school as well, but, same as family, everyone wants to talk about how awful, or, occasionally, how awesome work was. Listen to their motivators, their ""why""s and empathize with them on the subject of work. If they enjoy their career, get interested, ask difficult questions and let them show off their knowledge. If they hate it, find ways to hate it together, and have some fun. No need to get overly complex or involved, this whole method takes place in one conversation. 

**RECREATION**

Build them back up, put them in a great mood, and get them talking about their passions and hobbies. Talk about their recreations, and if you're knowledgeable on the subject, DON'T INTERJECT. Its their time shine, this is about them. They get to be the star of their own show, and you are the faithful audience, gripped with anticipation the whole time. 

**MESSAGE**

This is your message. This is where you tie everything you've learned so far into what you want from them. If your goal is to get them to buy your product, now is when you give them your message. 

""Its so awesome you've taken your health seriously. Your family will thank you for the extra time they'll get to spend with you. Listen, my gym has a discount card that would be perfect to help you lose that last few pounds you're working on. Would you like to hear more?""

Note that this is a random as hell example, but you see, it isn't a chance to say, ""Buy this,"" or ""Let me in free,"" or ""Give me all your money."" Its a chance to use the information you've gathered about them to get them interested in you, and willing to learn more. Sometimes, you may want an informant or a friend, or you may just be trying to build rapport.

""I totally agree, Gary Oldman is a talented actor. I've gotta go, but I wanna talk about movies some more. Listen, you should let me add you on Facebook, do you want my email or can I get yours, so I can find you?""

In sales, or recon, you want to get their contact information as often as possible, that way success or failure is your hands, not theirs. This is a great way to get an informant's number or their facebook, in this day and age. And with your new rapport, its possible you'll have a future customer, new friend, or source of dirty secrets in no time at all.

When the jar was completely empty, no one seemed to tip. It seems pretty obvious, seeing the cash indicated to customers that other people were tipping which would make them feel more inclined to tip. Also, being able to see cash is much more likely to make them think about tipping than an empty jar.

So, what i did each day was to take a dollar bill and position it so that it was sticking out and exposed.

1.) I carry dog treats with me. To avoid looking like I'm trying too hard for the tip, I often say something like, ""The puppies can always smell the food and get jealous. They'll like me a bit more for this anyways.""

2.) On my way to the door, I scope ANY information I can get on the people before knocking.

Some examples: 
Sports Team paraphernalia -- flags, bumper stickers, t-shirts, etc. to talk about, root for, or suggest. I've gotten great tips during the final four tournament doing this. 

College Paraphernalia -- same stuff^ but different topics. Can approach them about sports; I have claimed that their school is where I am attending (which has been true the times I have used it). 

3.) I compliment them on their property. Sometimes this opens them up for a little small talk and I can schmooze them for a friendlier relationship before they tip.

4.) Ask about the car in their driveway, if they like it, tell them it's nice, etc. This is just an opportunity to get friendly and for them to warm up.

5.) I always ask about their pets. Usually I am greeted by a dog and its owner. I tell them it's a pretty dog. What kind is it? What's his/her name? He looks like a good dog. He's just jealous of the food. No, they always love the guy with the food. 

6.) Sometimes children try to greet or talk to me. I show interest in what they are saying while the transaction is happening; don't ignore them. Sometimes parents appreciate that.

7.) ALWAYS be polite. Yes, ma'am. No, sir. Please. Thank you. Have a wonderful night. 

8.) Finally, be genuine. I really do like being friendly; yes, it is about the money, but being a nice and personable person is going to really get you there.

1373420874.0	1hz7vt	"Let's talk about the quality of ""charm"", how it works and how it can help you gain the upper hand of admiration and trust."	Captainstarbucs	119	15	16	"What makes someone charming? It's a quality that it is very hard to pinpoint the success of being a charmer, but the end result of charm is ultimately gaining admiration, whether it be friendly or romantically inclined, without necessarily being a ""people pleaser"".

The way I see it, charm can come naturally, or it can be developed by learning and absorbing the actions and reactions of a social situation. Personally, I wasn't born with ""charm"", but I think I was born with an attitude to be socially stringent, to listen more so rather than to speak in a conversation. USUALLY people like that kind of attitude, and through out my life, I believe that listening to other people will generally make you more likeable, but still not ""charming"".

Charm can be summed up as a low level mind control technique. Sure you don't have to be charming to have people LIKE you, but to ADMIRE you, it is something that requires being a charming person. So, what does it takes to be charming EXACTLY? Is it a quality or a technique WITHIN a quality? 

I can first tell you that charm is not directly linked with ""good looks"" body-feature wise. Perhaps charm is linked more so being clean and well kept, but not so much your body...to a certain degree anyway.

The next part of charm that I have noticed is your smile! There is no doubt that this is a major role in being charming. Having a genuine smile, making it look natural and enrapturing your...mark... to start to admire and trust you. Not only your smile, but the way your EYES smile as well. The two go hand in hand.

When not in person, charmers seem to be very eloquent when writing. English is a live, breathing language that currently seems to be bastardized by ""text speak"" in the past handful of years. One quality is to write well, without heaps of misspellings and being grammatically correct, but to the point where your language is so rigid that you sound like a robot. Using and playing with the English language as a tool, rather than just a communication device will net you admiration. Devise your own style of speech pattern, but don't deviate too much from the norm. Throw in some quarks, but don't let it be tacky or white-knighty. Picture a pimply faced fedora wearing teenager that speaks in that awful ""medieval"" speech pattern to their damsels who apparently are in distress. That is exactly the opposite of charm. In fact; that is a perfect example of trying too hard. If communicating electronically, it's been said before, but people usually love emoticons. Don't just use the same one over and over again. This can be used moreso romantically, but it still works between friendships. Just be sure to know when you're flirting and when you're being friendly.

:)  :&gt;  :V are some favorites of mine. They work very well. ;)

Body language is just as important too. Use your hands to accentuate what you are trying to say. Make it very subtle if you are speaking to someone normally, but if you are telling a funny story to someone, don't exaggerate the story, instead, exaggerate your arms and eyes to tell the story, stand up if you have to! Facial emotion counts just as much!

And I don't believe you can be charming without a teeny tiny little bit of cockiness. Not in the vein as being an arrogant asshole, but to the tune of being confident in yourself without making people believe that you are perfect and have all the answers.


Okay, so I've stated what I believe charm is, and it's not even a full opinion, just some bits and pieces that I have in my head at the time, but I'm curious... What do you guys think charm is and means? Please share your stories of how it got you an upper hand, and your techniques. Did you learn how to be charming or did it come natural?

Here is a TL;DR of how the attackers of Mat Honan managed to obtain enough information to SE Apple support (info from his [wired piece](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/)).


Now, all of this was aimed at getting access to his @mat account on twitter, so they needed his email.

* First, they grabbed, from emptypage.com, **his email**: mhonan@gmail.com
* Then, they tried password recovery at Gmail. Since 2FA was turned off, they were presented with the message ""We will send you an email to your secondary address: m*****n@me.com"" So, they knew his address was **mhonan@me.com**, and they had to gain control of his Apple Account. **Honan fail:** Two factor auth should be turned on.


* So they targeted his Amazon account instead! They grabbed **his address** from the whois info of emptypage.com, and called Amazon support to add a new (bogus) credit card to his account. **Info needed:** email address and billing address. Done. **Honan fail:**  Your real address is on the whois of your domain? Seriously? How is it needed for anything? To all the followers of the SEorg podcast, [this isn't news](http://www.social-engineer.org/episode-008-the-social-engineering-zero-day-revealed/) but then again, this was they key to everything else.
* Then, they called amazon again, to have his password reset. **Info needed:** email, billing address, and last 4 digits of *any* card number associated with the account. **Amazon fail:** they should require the card to have been ""validated"" by a successful payment/delivery. If they had done so, the card would have needed to be valid, and an unknown purchase made by a card you don't own is a big red flag.

* Now they have access to the Amazon account. From it, they lift **the last four digits of his (real) credit card number.**

* Finally, they call Apple support to have his password reset. **Info needed:** email, billing address, last four digits of credit card. Done. **Apple fail:** a credit card number is pretty much public information. Even more so the last four digits. (Fun fact: on credit card payment receipts, the masking of the CC number is inconsistent, sometimes the middle, sometimes the ends, so you can basically reconstruct it from various receipts left in, for instance, a car or a dumpster)

From there, it's the old password reset daisy chain. But they went with the tabula rasa approach to ensure control of the twitter account: change associated email address, deactivate gmail account, and wipe all devices associated with the AppleID.

Hope you enjoyed the writeup.

**TL;DR:** secrets are not secrets, masking information fails all around, emergency protocol and helpdesk is the weakest link.

1340937000.0	vrx8m	The best way to handle the common situation of inserting yourself into a new group.	bossman8	117	19	51	"Fairly straightforward, and quite common - you need to insert yourself into a group that you're not familiar with. This could happen at a new job/school/neighborhood/etc. Here's what I got so far, but there could be better approaches. Input appreciated.


My approach (a work in progress, haven't tested it yet)


1) Observe - take note of the group dynamics. Who is the leader, who are the little guys. 

2) Befriend. Instead of trying to insert yourself into the group immediately, focus your efforts on one member to become 'close' with. 

3) Use that member to gain access to the group, where your efforts then focus on becoming 'close' with the leader. 

4) You're now friends with the leader and in the group.

1372150538.0	1h10dm	Just a few things I've found to be helpful.	QuickestHipster	128	29	26	"First of all, to be a successful manipulator, you must at least maintain the appearance of being totally honest. If you think you can get away with lying, whatever. I'm not not here to tell you what to do. But I find it way easier to not have to keep track of lies. Besides, using only truth is much more fun and satisfying. Also, if you want people to listen to you, never repeat yourself unless someone asks you to and always be a source of valuable, accurate information.

If you want to know what people REALLY think of you, there's no better substitute for eavesdropping.

Nobody likes a thief. Don't steal from your friends (or people you may need something from later).

Do as few illegal things at a time as possible. For example, drive the speed limit if you have something The Man doesn't want you to have. And always make sure your car has all of its lights intact. It's way cheaper to fix a headlight than it is to go to jail because you got pulled over at the wrong time.

Never bring up something about yourself that the other person will obviously ask. For example, if you have bandages on your face (such as might be the case for someone with a badly broken nose) and start talking to someone for more than minute or two, the other person will ask you what happened 99.9% of the time. You'll be perceived as far more badass. 

Everybody wants something. If you give that to them, they will like you. If they like you, they will help you. You have to figure out what it is that they want, how to give it to them, and whether or not it is worth the cost of giving them what they want."	t5_2qlud	True

Con-men got their name from confidence. Not for the confidence they carried themselves with, that's expected of every man, but for the confidence they instilled in others. 

The social engineer requires the same tools. To get someone to believe in you, you must first get that person to believe in themselves. They must believe that what they are doing, who they are, how they live etc. is right. Doubt, you see, is what we rely on as humans to keep us alive. Was that a rustle in the bushes? Could it be a predator? Best check to be sure. Most times this reaction will result in nothing, but when it is correct, it is our saving grace. The mark, therefore, must believe so firmly that he is correct, must have such confidence in his belief, that he suppresses this evolutionary boon, and becomes complacent. That is the gift of a confidence man.

""Excuse me,"" a man asks, dripping wet and cold, ""could you help me get to King st.?"" The question of whether or not this man is serious never enters your mind, you can help him. You're confidant of that. This is the [Ben Franklin Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect). Once you've helped a person, you become more confidant in your ability to help them again, and the question of their motives never cross your mind.

This is the first step of any social engineering, trust.

**TRUST**

A man walks into an office building carrying a box. Long strides, big grin, eyes focused, everything about him says he has a purpose. People trust it. A man who is trusted is a man allowed. To gain trust, you must establish a non-malicious purpose. A motive which easily explains your story. A man with flowers in an office building? A clipboard outside of a house? An orange vest on the side of the road? Each tells a trustworthy story. 

Words are the riskiest way to get trust. People often say what they mean, even the social engineer. It takes a skilled wordsmith to shape words that convince and still fit a broader truth.

**WORD PLAY**

Even when trust is garnered, it sometimes comes to the Engineer to speak. Eloquent wording and a quick tongue are the most obvious tells of the liar. Life is awkward and poorly thought out. When asked a question ""fixing the pipes"" is less suspect that ""well, frank from the central office told me there was a bit of trouble on the second floor so I figured...""

Most people wouldn't give such odd speech a second thought, but if the social engineer is speaking, he's not worried about most people. He's worried about other engineers. That's the catch to the game we play, 90% of people are not our competitors. They are too entwined in their own games, their own lives, to even consider the insignificant nature of our own goals. The moral is to speak as little as possible, but that's not the subject of our final lesson.

**PARANOIA**

Knowing these three steps leads, invariably, to paranoia. Who else knows these tricks and are they being used on me now? The two questions of every budding social engineer. 

I will not tell you that you are safe. I will not try to instill confidence in you (if I could, you clearly haven't digested the lessons). To play this game is to accept a healthy dose of paranoia into your life. This is because you are lying. You are knowingly obscuring your own motives, and that weighs heavy on the mind. 

You can use your knowledge for good. You can create a code to separate the lying life from the honest life. You can do whatever you like to cope with reality. But know this -- to engineer a situation is to play with more information that those around you, and it's the weight from that knowledge, the weight of scheming, that will weigh on you. 

I'll take any questions about engineering. "	t5_2qlud	True

I never really realized how suspicious this might seem until one time I tried to get a money order, and they said 'oh sorry, the machine is down'.  Oh yes, *I'm sure it was* (sarcasm). What was I wearing at the time?  Gym shorts and a T-shirt.

So this got me thinking, what if my appearance was affecting people's judgment?  I mean, first off it definitely seems suspicious for a 21 year old to be using a card with 'long term customer' kind of shit on it, then to be dressed like someone poor would make people very suspicious of me being an identity thief.

So I tried a few places for money orders in small amounts to my girlfriend, 5 places when wearing 'street' clothes and 5 when dressed much nicer: A suit and tie, while holding a coffee.  I cleaned up and trimmed my nails well to give an appearance of being someone responsible.

Yup, 3 of the 5 places *declined* my money order when I was wearing street clothes, and none of them did when I was wearing the suit.

I thought this was a great idea but the enthusiasm seemed to have just faded away. 

If anyone's still interested I have an idea for a nice and easy first challenge to get us started:

GET FREE HBO
(or whatever other premium channels you want)

Call up your cable provider, ask to switch to their disconnection department and inform them that there are deals by other cable companies and you would consider switching-- but receiving free premium channels could change your mind. (Make sure you don't get convinced into getting a contract or anything.)

I called up my Cable Provider a few weeks ago, and I got 14 premium channels (for a year) AND $4 off the monthly bill. Now I get to enjoy Game of Thrones every Sunday night. 

So Like I said this challenge is very easy. [Here's a link](http://www.wisebread.com/want-free-hbo-or-showtime-just-ask) if you want a thorough explanation of what to do. If these weekly challenges catch on (which I hope!), we'll need some way to choose what will be the challenge for the following week.

1352358578.0	12ui1w	Social Engineering Through Text: Using subtle implications to present yourself differently	Balloons_lol	112	27	43	"Hello Guys Here Are Some Tips I Have Discovered For Aiding With Soical Enginnering

Just kidding. If you read that and were mildly annoyed by my grammatical errors, rampant capitalization, and lack of punctuation, you likely saw me as a bit less intelligent from the get go. In this post, I'm going to run down a few styles I've noticed and how they can be applied to present yourself differently by only altering your text. This obviously requires no facial expression, body language, etc., because it is an incredibly restricted medium. I won't really be going over word choice or sentence fluency as much as I will be going over deliberately breaking these rules, and how the patterns created affect the reader.

Perfect spelling, grammar, and punctuation is a standard method of communication employed by many. It's seen as the standard method of typing for most. It's professional, simple, and default to most people. While some use it while communicating with friends, it seems a bit formal to me. This type of language is best used whenever you can spare casuality - use it when talking to any higher ups in the office, any family members, and basically anyone you would want to impress.

but now if i talk without capitalization amongst a few other missing pieces of punctuation, the style is noticeably different. it's possible to seem foolish, stoned, or basically less intelligent this way, but if you present yourself well with a nice vocabulary, no blatantly bad spelling errors, and no horrible sounding sentences, the juxtaposition can have an opposite effect and will make you sound more intelligent. it frames the conversation differently. i am no longer a textbook reciting facts, i am now a guy speaking intelligently over the internet. did you notice the fact that i used a comma when i couldve used a semicolon up there? sometimes you can ignore question marks as well. see what i mean. this style should not use any exclamation marks though. you seem calm this way. you're not worried about appearing intelligent, you're just casually speaking.

NEVER USE ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE SHOUTING. THIS DOES NOT ADD EMPHASIS AS MUCH AS IT MAKES YOU LOOK LOUD.

Frequent use of elipses... makes you seem foolish I guess... can make you seem indecisive... it just sounds like you're trailing off... this should be avoided as well.


Punctuation overall has a massive effect on the reader. Ending a sentence with a period in perfect grammar is standard. Ending a period in lowercase mode emphasizes the point a bit more. Ending an all caps sentence adds a lot of emphasis but you are still coming off as confrontational because of the Internet shouting. Question marks don't always have to be used with questions. They can sow a lack of confidence or confusion. ""I'm already in that menu?"" when asking about tech support. ""You're already signed in though?"" when somebody posts about how they're having login issues. Similarly, ignoring question marks adds to the nonchalant style, and is better when used in conjunction with the lowercase style than the perfect grammar style.

Who the hell cares.

or

who the hell cares.

Seem a bit different. The second one sounds a lot more laidback.

Exclamation mark! These can be used for excitement! Do not combine with lowercase style unless you know what you're doing.

""yay!"" can come off as juvenile, but this can be used in your favor at time. A friend of mine has mastered this, essentially. He posted a picture of him holding a red balloon on Facebook with the caption simply, ""yay!"" It sounds more laidback than, ""Yay!"" for reasons we've already discussed. Simply saying ""Yay."" has an adverse effect. It makes you sound sarcastic. That applies to periods used in almost all normally happy sounding phrases. Hooray. Woohoo. Fun.

Now, continuing onward, what if you want to annoy your reader for some reason? Well, there's [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12siib/my_most_aggravating_grammatical_pet_peeve_is_when/) on askreddit right now. A few examples:

1. Talking Like This Is Really Quite Obnoxious Because The Reader Has To Wonder Why You're Capitalizing The First Letter Of Every Word. This Takes Effort. Laziness Would Be Understandable, Which Is Why Lowercase Style Is Inoffensive, But What The Hell Is Up With This? Plus, The Voice In Your Head Adds An Upward Inflection At Every Word. Gah! Annoying!

2. ThIs Is JuSt BlAtAnTlY aNnOyInG aNd MaKeS yOu LoOk LiKe YoU'rE tWeLvE. pLuS, iT's NoT eAsY!

3. mispell evryday wurds cn be anoying, as wel as l33tspeak, bt if u do it to oftin, it gets ovious.

4. Choppy sentences. Makes you hesitate. I picture an Asian guy. Chop. Chop.

5. Run on sentences can be particularly annoying, and if they go on long enough, the internal breath you take when you read sentences in your head can run out which is strange because you don't really need air to read something in your head but you do it anyway.

6. LOL! OMG! Capitalizing Internet speak abbreviations, as well as doing old fashioned smilies (adding a nose in your smiley :-) like that) can make you seem old. G2G, CYA later.

Now, for application. How can you employ these styles to your benefit? Well, annoying your audience is useless in almost all cases. Use it sporadically for parody or sarcasm but it is still annoying and if you overdo it, the reader will be annoyed at you as well. The right combination of spelling mistakes, missing commas, and other abbreviations can add to a personal style that many people have. For example, many teenage girls talk like this:

""i mean idk hes just cute ig, lol. tbh i dont like math.""

Which reminds me, ending sentences strangely can add to humorous effect. ""i mean are you just stupid or"" can be used. As well as ""well he said he was gonna pick me up now so"" is also usable. They present the reader with the burden of coming up with the alternative.

1335209740.0	somsh	Personality types and their susceptibilities? Took your advice yesterday and had great success.	FulminatedMercury	93	15	22	"So I read a while back here that certain personality traits have their weaknesses. One that stuck out with me was that people who are insecure are susceptible to flattery. The guy that is always talking about how great he is at everything can be given a few compliments and instantly he's social engineered into doing something. Well I am amazed. Not only did it work but it exceeded my expectations. 


So I was wondering, what other personality traits have susceptibilities? What will cause a narcissistic person or a passive aggressive person to give in to social engineering?

**Edit: Only took a bit more surfing to find what I was looking for. Wikipedia has a great page on psychological manipulation.** - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation

**Common vulnerabilities**


**Naïveté** - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or is ""in denial"" if he or she is being victimized


**Over-conscientiousness** - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim


**Low self-confidence** - victim is self-doubting, lacking in confidence and assertiveness, likely to go on the defensive too easily.


**Over-intellectualization** - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful.


**Emotional dependency** - victim has a submissive or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable he or she is to being exploited and manipulated. 


**Too trusting** - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc. They rarely question so-called experts.


**Too altruistic** - the opposite of psychopathic; too honest, too fair, too empathetic


**Too impressionable** - overly seduced by charmers. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming politician who kisses babies.


**Too naïve** - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world or if there were they would not be allowed to operate.


**Too masochistic** - lack of self-respect and unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.


**Too insecure** – those with oversized egos are overly susceptible to flattery


**Too narcissistic** – these types suffer from the constant pain of nobody else paying them enough attention. A simple “I was thinking of you when…” can work wonders. Narcissists are also prone to falling for unmerited flattery.


**Too greedy** - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way.


**Too immature** - has impaired judgment and believes the exaggerated advertising claims.


**Too materialistic** - easy prey for loan sharks or get-rich-quick schemes


**Too dependent** - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no.


**Too lonely** - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price.


**Too impulsive** - make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting others.


**Too frugal** - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason why it is so cheap


**The elderly** - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. 

**The ""disease to please""**

**Addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others**

**Emotophobia** (fear of negative emotion)

**Lack of assertiveness and ability to say no**

**Blurry sense of identity** (with soft personal boundaries)

**Low self-reliance**

**External locus of control**

1352574992.0	12z38i	Criminal Impostor intercepted my dinner and delivered Pizza to my house to steal my bank card (xpost r/Canada)	pain_perdu	108	29	32	"I posted this earlier this week but just heard about this subreddit and thought you might be interested as well.  So I ordered from [Pizzapizza.com](http://www.Pizzapizza.com) (largest pizza company in Canada) and chose the option to pay with bank card at the door.  I got a call (this was the first hint something was off) a few minutes later asking me to confirm how I planned to pay.  Shortly thereafter, a guy shows up with my order, I pay using my card and head in to eat my dinner.  In fact I actually called him back (the number that called me to ask how I was paying) to say he forgot a sauce I ordered, so he returned a few minutes later with that.

Fast-forward two days and I get a call from the bank saying someone tried (unsuccessfully) to empty my account in the next town over.  I suspected the Pizza company right away because I hadn't used that card for anything else in a long time so I called them up and after some questioning I found out that they logged a call a few minutes after I placed my order via the web, the caller provided all the details from my order and requested the order be changed from Delivery to Pickup.  [Click Here](http://imgur.com/a/xrIyf) to see the paperwork the pizza company subsequently provided me.

So **TLDR:** Someone (some gang) either hacked [Pizzapizza.com](http://www.Pizzapizza.com) or else they have a dishonest employee leaking customer orders to the gang who then change it to a pickup order, showup to the house with a skimmer and steal bank details while impersonating delivery drivers.

grrrrrrr.  Meanwhile cops have very little to go on and the Pizza company listened to my story but has not been in touch since."	t5_2qlud	True

1360645933.0	18d06m	What's the best thing SE's got you?	eoJ1	92	17	50	"At the request of a few people, I posted this, partly to tell how I did it and answer any questions, and partly to hear other people's experiences and thoughts.

Anyway, here's the request: http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/18bx8z/i_snuck_into_the_superbowl_without_paying_amaa/c8dmtky?context=3 So yeah, I got backstage and on stage at a major music festival, without anything. I also got a £20 ticket to the Olympics closing ceremony and got into the seats that were exclusively for the big time sponsors - to give you an idea, I sat next to the UK McDonalds heads, and I took the photo of a Samsung head for him. The seats had a value of £2.5k each. I also used the same tactics for getting very nice (often front row) Olympic seats.


Firstly, this post was incredibly helpful: http://www.nevblog.com/how-to-crash-a-party/ everyone should read it.

I'm gonna warn you now, I don't think anything I'm gonna say is gonna be mind-blowing, but I'll say it anyways.

For the festival, it was simple. Met up with some people I knew, turned out they knew someone and all had BAA (Backstage all areas) passes. This gave them a lanyard (fairly similar in looks to the one they gave everyone who came into the festival) and a wristband. Naturally, I wanted to get backstage, so I simply got in roughly the middle of the group of 6 (far enough from both ends to get the security at hopefully their minimum observation level), maintained a look and posture of confidence, but not so much as to draw attention. When it was my turn, I flashed my wrist briefly enough for them to see vaguely the right colour wristband, but not to be able to inspect too closely. I can't remember what I did with my eyes. Writing this, I feel as if it might be best to either make strong eye contact and say a passing comment to distract and build rapport, or look at somewhere other than the wrist. I think probably a combination, i.e. eye contact followed by a brief look in the wrong direction downwards to make them feel as if they've checked.

Olympics again, wasn't anything too groundbreaking. For the closing ceremony, I went upstairs first, to my legit seat, to scout the area and level of security a little. Then, I went downstairs, and used the toilet (I knew it would be my last chance for a few hours) then filled a bottle of water to the brim. I removed the cap, and put it in my pocket. Oh, darn! Looks like with a phone in one hand and a full, uncapped bottle of water in the other, I couldn't reach my ticket without spilling water everywhere.

There were two sets of security, the first the most heavily guarded, the second less so. The first I simply held back, used the fake call function on my phone so it'd ring, then pretended to talk on it, until the security were distracted with someone who was confused. I just acted like I was supposed to be in there, walked to the left of the confused people (but not fully in) and stood on the left side of some people that were getting their tickets checked, one step ahead of them, to give the impression that I'd already had my ticket checked. I stopped fairly deliberately, with a confused look on my face, acting like there was a particularly interesting part of my call. As they started to go, I began walking, keeping out of view from the security by using the people to block the view.

The second was easier. The stadium was circular, so I just walked around it (slowly) until I spotted someone about to go to their seats. Same tactic, phone call, wait until they're about to have their ticket inspected, sneak up the side, take a seat. After that point, all was fine, I was in, so no need to worry anymore. I got chatting with the execs and was totally open about it. 1 person asked if they could switch seats so they could be next to their wife, which I did.

If anyone wants to ask anything, I'm open to it. Also, it'd be really awesome if people could post their own experiences.

Proof: (Festival, meeting Ellie Goulding backstage - no that's not me, and sorry, I didn't take any pictures on the stage - however you can see the lanyards &amp; blue wristbands, as well as someone getting interviewed for the BBC on one of the benches) http://i.imgur.com/3nmIQKe.jpg

Olympics I don't have proof, however if anyone has the closing ceremony downloaded, look for the point where the athletes come through the crowd, I can be seen shaking hands with Mo Faraj.

1355951820.0	154ntz	Someone called a family member of mine trying to socially engineer information about me	onionsman	90	14	49	"I got a call from my sis saying a man called her asking about my personal information. She thought it may be a debt collector, but said he sounded suspicious and I have never owned a credit card, or taken out a loan. She told him to f-off, and she gave me his number. (or the number he called from)

I was able to reverse look-up the land line (which was activated in 1999), and locate his house. So he either works from home, or is a scammer. I found the name of the property owner while digging through some real estate data, but it didn't match the callers first name.

I have created a google voice account with his area code using a throwaway email, and connected it to a throwaway phone. 

The question is, what to do next. 

Anyone have similar stories or suggestions?

UPDATE: Called the number number provided by my sis from a google voice account with similar area code to his. The answer was 'Hello, Hello, Hello...' 30 second pause, then a hang up. I would imagine if he was with a collection agency, he would have answered differently. I found another number associated with his name. I am planning on changing the google voice number, and trying that later to see if the same man answers to explore the possibility of caller ID spoofing...

There must be a lot of capable Social Engineers, and I would love to read your stories!

Recently I've read a lot of posts in /r/seduction (subreddit for so-called pick up artists, PUA) and it was really inspiring. 

I think you can compare the two ""arts"". PUA is manipulating women, SE is manipulating other people. I apologize in advance, because I know that regarding SE as just a simple means to an end is generally frowned upon.

But let's have a look of what kind of posts are made in /r/seduction:

* 'Field reports': The redditor describes his own experience when applying what he learnt in the subreddit to real life, often describing a coherent scene. He then sums up what he has learnt and asks how he can improve his technique.

* Asking for advice on specific, but abstract problems.

* Just thoughts, ""mind experiments"", of what *could work*.

* Linking to newly found material (literature) on the general topic of seduction (or SE, respectively).

In /r/SE there are a lot of links to literature, which is not bad, but I would like to see more ""discussion"", not only commenting on what was written somewhere else.

Of course there are ""famous"" cases of applied SE which are worth discussing about, but I would also like to read more from Redditor-Social-Engineers, who **could then provide immediate Feedback to the community.**

Those field reports are kind of like a self-initiated AMA that tries to answer all the questions the community might have already, and then answers the remaining questions of the community.

So, what do you think? I would also like to know from the mod in case what I'm proposing is totally against the guidelines of the subreddit.

(repost from /r/netsec)	the_social_engineer	77	13	30	"So in the last year or so I have been primary doing social engineering and physical security. I'm close to friends, very close, and they are all privy to the type of work I do. In a recent argument I had with a friend who was having a falling out of sorts with me, he brought up that no one can 'trust me' because I do social engineering. He went on to further elaborate, ""you armed with social engineering means you can manipulate situations like this to get the best possible outcome for you"". He then went on further to say that this isn't the first time he has talked with one of my friends about social engineering and they think it's a real concern.

Obviously this is a strange position to be put in. Since I started this new role, I have never used any of the tactics or techniques I use on the job with any friends or family members. But these friends of mine have been friends for years, feel that since they have known me forever and know i can be the type to bend the truth, they feel this knowledge must inherently make me bad.

I ask you SE's if you have run into any similar issues with friends, family, etc. related to this profession and how you have worked it out.

I picked up my notepad and off I went.  I bumped into someone on my way and asked them if they knew which meeting room I was supposed to be in (it wasn't specified on the meeting).  They told me and away I went.

I got to the room and saw people were already in and I appeared late.  I opened the door, scanned the room for someone I knew (which was the office manager), then made my way to sit next to them while giving my apologies for being late.  

Everyone looked at me and I opened my notepad, straightened my back and appeared attentive.  Nobody asked me anything and the meeting carried on.

About 1 min later I realised I was in a company strategy meeting with members of the board and I had no reason to be in there whatsoever BUT because I thought I was supposed to be there and must've given off the right ""I'm meant to be here"" vibes not a single person questioned why a lowly member of IT should waltz into the meeting.

This subreddit has always helped me, so I'm happy to try to give back.

To start, some background: I'm 20y/o from the US, meaning I'm not legally allowed to drink yet. I have a fake ID that I would describe as ""serviceable"", meaning it'll work at college bars, but higher-end bars usually won't let me in. 

Anyway, I live in a pretty major city during my summers, and last night I went to a bar/grill with members of my company to grab some drinks/food before a show we were going to see. I decided that it wasn't worth it to try to use my fake ID, I would have to drive home that night, and there was just no real incentive. Everyone else with me (6 or 7 people) was 21.

We get to the bar, I inform the bouncer I'm not 21, he's okay with it but just tells me I can't drink, obviously. Anyway, I'm drinking water and everyone else is having some mixed drink. I'm feeling lame and childish. We were seated in the back of the bar, out of eyesight from the bouncer. I assumed that the bouncer hadn't told our waitress I wasn't 21, why would he? There were others at the bar who weren't 21, and he has other things to do. So, I try to order a drink, and the waitress looks at my suspiciously: ""You aren't 21...""

""Yes I am""

"" The guy at the front said you weren't""

At this point I'm thinking 'shit, now I'm lying to this chick right in front of my supervisor'. I decide I'm too far in the lie to turn back, ""That's strange, I have my ID right here"", I show her my ID. She accepts it and apologizes. 

5 minutes later and my supervisor points to our waitress, who is talking to the original bouncer and pointing at me. I'm thinking 'I'm so fucked, I'm gonna get us all kicked out, and I'll be humiliated'. Of course, it's too late to turn back now.

The bouncer comes up to me. I'm laughing and pretend I'm enjoying myself. He taps me on the shoulder and says, ""You told me you weren't 21."" I make solid eye contact, look at him in a confused manner, and say ""I'm not sure what you're talking about, I have my ID right here."" I pull out my wallet, not breaking eye contact. I'm smiling slightly, to come off as confident. He takes my ID and looks at it, looks back at me (I'm holding his gaze), he asks why I said I wasn't 21 earlier, ""I'm sorry man, I don't know what you're talking about, that ID says I'm 21, I'm not trying to start any trouble."" I'm still holding eye contact, he looks at me, looks at the ID, and looks confused. ""Are you sure it was me who said they were under 21?"" I look at him, slightly accusatorily, and put him on the defensive. He seems nervous now, a few people from other tables are watching. He gives me back my ID, ""really sorry about the mix-up"" he says. I'm staring right in his motherfucking eyes, ""No worries, mistakes happen."" 

Next thing I know the waitress comes around and gives me a drink on the house ""I'm sorry again sir!"". 

Moral of the story: Even if you're freaking out internally (my heart was pounding out of my chest), keep calm, stick to your story (as soon as you start to second-guess your original story, you lose all credibility), maintain eye contact (it comes off as confrontational, and 9/10 the person on the receiving end of your eye contact won't want any confrontation), and put the other party on the defensive, make them make a decision."	t5_2qlud	True

1348178923.0	107sb7	How to target someone who is easily distracted or is open to suggestion.	Travestine	78	16	37	"People react in various ways to situations, and this also applies to *hypothetical* situations. 

This works both as a probing question mid-conversation, and as an opener: Ask someone a what-if question, or make a hypothetical statement that paints a very vivid picture. 

For example:

* To the person who just made your milkshake: ""Jesus, this milkshake is thick. If I choke on this and die, I'm gonna haunt you.""
* To the person standing in line in front of you: ""Hey. What would you do if a bank robber came in right now?""

Pay attention to their reaction. Some people will react analytically/negatively (""I have never seen anyone choke on these milkshakes""/""There's plenty of security here."") Note that negative does not mean ""bad"", but more like unresponsive to the question. Other people will react emotionally/positively (""OH MY GOD, don't say that!""/""Do you really think that could happen?"") 

It is the latter type of response we are interested in. By reacting emotionally, they are constructing 'that moment' within their visual mind in vivid detail. This serves two purposes:

**1: This is a mind very susceptible to suggestion.** They imagine a situation before judging/analyzing the possibility of the situation. You could ask a girl ""Could you see yourself giving me your number?"" and she'll picture it in her head before thinking ""Oh wait, I can't, I have a boyfriend."" She might smile first. You could plant the image of a security guard's boss walking down these stairs right now and chewing the shit out him for not letting you in and costing the company money, before the critical part of his mind dismisses the idea. Also see: [Priming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/zu0th/a_primer_on_priming/)

To blur the boundary between reality and imagination, use examples that are in **your immediate surroundings**. 


**2: This is a mind easily distracted.** The human mind sucks at multi-tasking: [This research paper](http://www.psych.utah.edu/lab/appliedcognition/publications/cellphone.pdf) deals with the phenomenon of 'inattention-blindness' and the difficulty in mentally processing one's current situation with the attention required to be engaged in a cell-phone conversation. Even more significantly, there was a huge difference between in-person conversations and cell-phone conversations, because of the tendency to visualize the person you're talking to over the phone. 

For the purposes of distraction, you should not use the above-type examples (all which take place in the immediate vicinity and quickly imagined), and instead lead into a topic that **takes place outside/someplace else** (The parking lot, Zucotti Park, whatever) and then ask your hypothetical/priming question. The visual processing required to imagine one's self and other people will temporarily distract them from the present; they are *almost literally* 'not here'.

After a few of these presentations she apparently mentioned to her boss that I am ""hesitant to show my work"". This is really quite frustrating as I have been working on the more difficult aspects of the project and have made a lot of progress.  

I am wondering how to best approach the situation. She is out of town for a little bit so I am wondering if I should have a little one on one with her boss who I am on very good terms with, and who was the one to give me her feedback originally, and show him everything I have been doing. Or if I should send her an email highlighting all the work I have done. Advice would be appreciated. 

Edit: I should add that right now I am leaning toward emailing her because I don't want her to feel like I'm going behind her back to her boss or anything since she is my direct supervisor.

1353655920.0	13nqi5	Con Games in Virtual Space. A brief look into the EVE Online scamming scene	LetMeExplain	73	12	7	"EVE Online is a unique game in that not only do scams occur regularly, but when they do they are not punished by the game moderators; as all assets were transferred willingly, anything short of hacking someones account and giving yourself all their assets is fair game. In game based on spaceships and conquest, the metagame of deception is both accepted and necessary in order to further personal and alliance goals. This is not to say that everyone is aware of this metagame, many players living in the safe confines of high security space spend their time blissfully ignorant of the myriad of different cons out in the game universe. Players run missions for factions for in game money, mine asteroids, manufacture, and generally stay within the confines of their corporations (clans, guilds, whatever); many of which are small, specialized in a certain aspect of the game, and have limited interaction with the general player base, sticking to the safety of their cliques. This means that as long as there are people playing, there are marks to con. Here are a few points to keep in mind:

1. When you lose a ship in eve online, it is gone. Buy a new one if you have the Isk (money) for it. 
2. The game is notoriously complex, making it easy to deceive marks with aspects of the game that they have no experiance in.
3. Everyone wants more of something, whether its a larger community, better quality asteroids, better npcs to shoot at and make money off of, better opportunities for pvp on a large and organized scale, and better modules to fit on their ships. Basically, there are dozens of ways you can hook people into a con. 

With that, here is a list of scams that I have ecountered in the game.

**The Recruitment scam:**

This is the scam I have the most experience with by far. The hook is that you find a player looking for a new corporation to join, you being in a large alliance that lives in lawless, sovereign space have access to the best that the game has to offer. The line is feeding the mark the information he wants to hear, exactly what it is that your corp does is right in line with what they do, but you have access to premium resources which will make them more money than they could imagine. During this process you aquire the players full api key, a gadget that gives you a complete look at the players assets, wallet, mails, transactions, skills, and all other aspects of their in game character. The sinker is that you either 

a. require a security deposit to hold as collateral in case they are a spy (one part of the meta game aiding another) or awoxer (a player who joins for the soul purpose of killing fellow unsuspecting corp members)
 
b. you could forego the security deposit and instead offer them free shipping of their assets to your sovereign space, having them make a courier contract without any collateral for the goods to be shipped, letting you open the package and keep their items without reprimand. There are a great many aspects to this scam, and no two are the same from eachother, nor should they be. The meat of this con is in the line, building the illusion that you live in paradise, and they could too if they do what you say. Again, there are many aspects to the scam, ive even incorporated other scams within this one such as the Boxing scam or the Glim dropper at one point or another. [Here] (http://themittani.com/news/alod-gullible-aeon) is an example of a scam I pulled recently that was somewhat newsworthy. 


**The Pile of Items/ Misrepresentation scam**

This scam is similar to the money making machine scam. The hook is to make a post on the market forums for the game, stating that you are wanting to liquidate a large amount of items, and you are willing to take a hit on the value of said items for the convenience of getting rid of them quickly. The line is to buy up a large sum of cheap items, including the cheapest versions of popular rare ship modules to give the list legitimacy. The point is to amass such a large amount of crap, making it difficult for people to gauge the value of the items. After that it is a matter of being contacted by prospective marks, giving false time constraints, and giving them as little time as possible for them to review the contract and decide. 

**The isk doubling scam**

This is probably the most commonly seen scam in the game, viewable at any major in game trade hubs. The hook is to have marks send you any amount of money which will be doubled, or tripled. After that it is a simple process of naming various inactive characters in the local system and saying that they have won x amount of isk. Basically, name dropping inactive players to give the scam legitimacy. 

**The contract scam**

Also a widely popular scam, found being spammed in various forms day and night in trade hubs everywhere. The premise is to misrepresent the value of the items being sold, sometimes advertising selling a fully fit ship, without selling the ship itself. There is no line, simply throwing out bait and hope to catch a gullible sucker to hit accept on your bogus offer. The brilliant part of this scam is that it requires little effort, and bogus offers are mixed in with legitimate offers in local chat, being a trade hub and all. 

All in all, EVE online provides a playground for con games with impunity from the game moderators. Provided you learn the mechanics of player interaction. Once you understand that, it is not difficult to construct a con in order to abuse those mechanics. It is worth mentioning that Reddit has an EVE online corporation which is one of the largest in the game, founder of the largest soverign alliance in the game, owns over 3 regions of space, and allows members to scam; with the caveat that they do not use their Dreddit character for recruitment scams, this is easily circumvented by making a new character and placing them in a Player alt corp within the alliance (a collection of corporations under the same banner). Outside of recruitment scams, Dreddit members are allowed to do any other kind of scam they can think of as long as you are not scamming someone within the alliance or an ally. So if any of you young and enterprising social engineers want to refine your skills, please feel free to join in on the fun, and do not hesitate to contact me in game with any questions regarding cons. Nynjato is the name of my main character. 

This is not meant to be a definitive list of cons for EVE online, there are dozens or hundreds more that are viable. These scams outlined are merely the most encountered, and you know what they say, the older the trick the easier it is to pull.

Good morning,

I've been reading TFTS for a while, and thought I should start adding some of my own. This story takes place while I was a consultant working for a firm out of Texas. For this gig I was sent to a training facility to be their SysAdmin.

I arrive on site at the correct time, and am let into the building. The staff member asks why I've shown up, and I respond that I've been hired to be a Systems Admin for this site. The guy looked very nonplussed, gave me the root password so I could start looking around, and disappeared into a back room. 

Shortly later he leaves the site, leaving me alone. 

About an hour later, someone from management shows up and welcomes me there, shows me around, and gives me an in-brief. After seeing the site and learning what they want / need, I ask who the person was who let me in initially.

Turns out it was their old SysAdmin. No one had told him yet...

The original article at http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11gm63/on_how_i_found_out_how_to_be_treated_as_an/ )

Here is another tale of mine. It takes place probably two years after my last one. I am still a consultant, and doing a lot (100%) travel for my client.

In this case, I was sent to one of their offices in Boise. As a side note, there is really NO good reason to ever stop in Boise that I could find. On full expense account, I could not find a restaurant worth going back to a second time. Even Pizza Hut failed to live up to their (low) standards... I asked for extra cheese on a pizza and received a pizza with cheese slices on it.... But I digress.

I was at this location for a few weeks, and the employees were basically treating me like shit. I was being ignored, my requests were not serviced, etc. Essentially, since I was a contractor, I wasn't worth their time.
At the coffee stations they had throughout the building, they had little tiny styrofoam cups you could use. Obviously most people had their own mugs from home that they used.

One morning, I decided I had enough of these tiny cups that ended up burning my fingers and brought in one of the mugs from the hotel. As soon as people saw me with a real mug instead of using a styrofoam cup, they started treating me like an employee. People who had ignored me for the past two weeks started talking to me.
People who had ignored my requests for information on how their systems were configured started being helpful. The security guard who had been chasing me out of the building at 4:30 stopped.

I want to talk about legal moneymaking - although not necessarily ethical - businesses that have a fair amount of potential.

To start off, a good example is those reverse auction websites. Although there have been discussions involving legislation against these, they are at the moment still legal. However, like any good scam, the odds are heavily balanced towards whoever's running the business.

The basic premise of these as it's sold to the customers is that you can get valuable items like an iPad, HDTV, or even a car for a fraction of the retail price by reverse bidding. So the price will start at, say, $500, and every bid drives the price down. The price it ends at is the price it sells for. So if the new iPad starts at $500 but the winning bid is just $23, that's the selling price. As you can imagine, this shit is very addictive.

The genius of these for the individual(s) behind them is that you charge for each bid. Let's say each bid costs $2 and drives the price of the item down by $1 to keep things simple for our example. So that iPad that went down from $500 to $23 actually made $954 for the seller. Assuming $500 is the true retail value, the profit is $454 for that single sale. Of course in reality you'd buy the products in bulk rather than paying retail, so you'd make an even bigger profit.

Then of course you have the payday loan companies that charge you 2,000% APR and repossess your house if you can't pay it back. No further explanation needed there.

This was interesting to me, as my previous job was working as a makeup artist so I consciously avoided glasses. Now that I work in tech, I've ditched the contacts - and most of the makeup. 

I worked at a company where I had to wear business dress daily, and was surprised how seriously people seem to take you when you're in a suit.

I've heard other people say that an 'executive coach' told them people who wear thick or heavily rimmed glasses can be perceived as ""hiding"" behind their frames or not fully forthcoming.

I noticed that a lot of the body language walls people had put up against me were falling away as they gained respect for me. But not John. He continued to be contemptuous of my work and always tried to find faults in my work.

For the longest time I wasn't sure how to handle him. I tried being nice, that didn't work. I asked him for suggestions on how I could improve the project I could work on, and he nitpicked at the little unimportant details as if they were fundamental design flaws. Of course I would fix the problems he pointed out, but I hated the way he did it. I tried bringing him on to my work by asking him for help and patronizing him about how much more senior he was to me but that didn't work. I figured if I could bring him on I would be adding value to him, and therefore we would get along better but that didn't work. I was out of ideas and chose to completely ignore him for a while

As I was scheduled to present my project to a few different managers, I needed some external input to see any glaring problems with my project that could possibly be brought up during the presentation. Essentially QA testing. I've asked John to do this for me before but he shrugged it off. I emailed my boss saying that my project is nearly complete and the presentation is ready. I also said that I was going to ask John for his input on my project, and that John has been an invaluable resource during the project. Of course I CC'd John on this email. His nitpicking at the small details had actually really helped me develop something great, and my motivation to fix those problems was to spite him.

What I realized was that I was giving John a huge amount of external validation for not a lot of work, and that by emailing our boss about how helpful he has been, I made him look good. The next time I saw John he was incredibly nice and provided a lot of great input towards my work before the presentation. He's never been friendlier and we get along great now!

**TL;DR: I gave value to a coworker that always showed a lot of contempt towards me by emailing my boss that John has been a great support to my project and CC'ing John. Now we get along great!**"	t5_2qlud	True

1327346300.0	ot843	Let's talk about pickpocketing	wat_waterson	79	20	24	"Social engineering, lockpicking, hacking, they are all kinds of moral grey areas in each. While many of us use these skills for good, others do not. I don't often see a lot mentioned about pickpocketing when talking about social engineering, but I see a lot about lockpicking. While pickpocketing seems to focus on two areas at the moment: theft and stage magic, I feel that there is use in pickpocketing as a part of being a social engineer. A lot of the thinking behind pickpocketing translates into social engineering, profiling, pretexting, misdirection, basic psychology, etc.

I'm interested in learning more about this skill and I'm going through the process of acquiring practice dummies to hone my skill, much like I would get practice locks to practice my lockpicking. 

Anyways, enough rambling, here are some links:

[http://pickpocket.blog.ca/](http://pickpocket.blog.ca/) Blog by an amateur pickpocket. He doesn't steal, but he puts little cards in people's pockets or purses to let them know they should be paying more attention. He has some tutorials on his blog.

Psycology behind pickpocketing and marks: [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/11/01/my-day-with-a-master-pickpocket-behind-the-scenes-at-the-making-of-a-neuroscience-and-magic-video/](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/11/01/my-day-with-a-master-pickpocket-behind-the-scenes-at-the-making-of-a-neuroscience-and-magic-video/) (this highlights some of the SE skills involved)

Does anyone have any stories they'd like to share about using pickpocketing on an engagement, or any resources for others to learn this skill? (assume basic Googling has been done, because it has been)

edit: tl;dr: I'm interested to see if I'm crazy in assuming this would be valuable in SE engagements, or if other higher tech methods are better. (taking pictures of badges, cloning proxcards, etc)

Put different amounts of money, in small denomination bills (preferably one-dollar bills), in different pockets, so you have better negotiating leverage.  

Pockets should contain: $3, $5, $10 , $20.... and then ""hide"" the rest somewhere else.

So now you come upon an object you like. If the price $12 but you want to pay $10, pull out the $10, and look forlorn about it.  If the price is $25 but you think the thing is only worth $15, get money from the $10 pocket and the $5 pocket.... etc.

Once that transaction is done, redistribute money through your pockets so you can do it again at the next vendor (this is why it's good to have lots of small bills)

You can also ""plant"" additional money on your friend/spouse in the same way.

Pro version: If you're buying several things, ask for a discount.  Once they give you their ""best price"", act like you're rummaging through your pockets to find additional money, and proceed with the technique above...  ""Will you take $20 for all of it?""

He bends the rules and has a consistent habit of preying on college students. In particular he has a poor history of returning deposits. He is yet to return the deposits of people who moved out last year, despite saying he would.

It turns out[*] that he failed to install a fire alarm amongst other lesser issues, such as the fire extinguisher being empty. The former  is serious business as you can imagine, but the other is less so. I hope to use this as leverage to induce him to be more ... impartial this year when he is deciding how much of my deposit to give back.

Some internet sluething suggests that I must show that I must have already given the landlord written notice (by letter, not text or email) before the local authorities will likely do anything. He has already been informed verbally by two of my housemates concerning this issue.

I want to present him with a written demand, but to phrase it in such a way that he does not take it seriously, so I can persuade him to return the deposits. I have been nothing but polite towards him so far. 

I would very much appreciate your suggestions.

 I thought of discussing it verbally with him, but write it down on a piece of paper at the same time then give to him. The idea is that he will have recieved  a written demand from me.

I am aware of the difficulities, it seems wise to assume that the landlord is totally familiar with the law, so he will likely get his act together as soon as he recieves the letter. He is very greedy however, and is almost a caricature of Mr. Krabbs from Spongebob Squarepants! I am hoping that it would not be too difficult to persuade him that he can get away with doing nothing if I choose my approach carefully. 

**EDIT:** Some ideas I just had:

* It did occur to me that I could phrase the letter as an inquiry (please sir, will you install a fire alarm?), or even ask will the money for installing a new fire alarm come out of the deposit! I would imagine so long as the letter indicates that fire alarm is missing, it will hold up as evidence that I gave the landlord written notice that it is missing, even if I don't explicitly demand that he fix it. It would definititely give the him the impression that he could ride roughshod over me, essentially acting weak to get him to lower his guard. 

* In line with the above theme, if I were to handwrite it, but print it like a child instead of cursive, it may also contribute an impression that the letter isn't serious. 

* I could also push it through his lettterbox instead of posting it?

* Feign ignorance of the law by including something such as ""I'm not sure what the rules for this are..""?

I'm looking foward to your ideas!

**TL,DR** Getting my landlord to ignore a written notice to install a fire alarm, so I can threaten to go all /r/pettyrevenge on him if attempts to cheat me out of my deposit

One notable highlight was that he successfully performed open chest surgery while posing as a naval officer.

&gt;He had come to two beliefs. One was that in any organization there is always a lot of loose, unused power lying about which can be picked up without alienating anyone. The second rule is, if you want power and want to expand, never encroach on anyone else's domain; open up new ones. ""I call it 'Expanding into the power vacuum'"" Demara explained. ""It works this way. If you come into a new situation (there's a nice word for it) don't join some other professor's committee and try to make your mark by moving up in that committee. You'll, one, have a long haul and two, make an enemy. That way there's no competition, no past standards to measure you by. How can anyone tell you aren't running a top outfit? And then there's no past laws or rules or precedents to hold you down or limit you. Make your own rules and interpretations. Nothing like it. Remember it, expand into the power vacuum!""

1370817169.0	1g09ed	How do I start casual conversations?	Nexus2045	80	25	47	"I've always preferred having serious, logical, analytical conversations. Unfortunately most people don't seem to lean this way. The normal person tends to prefer banter, fun conversations that uplift them in terms of emotion, not having to use brainpower to make logical deductions.

Its for this reason why I can't even make friends efficiently (and without this, I doubt I'll ever get into social engineering properly). 

When I make myself talk to people, usually all I can come up with on the spot is a close-ended question that doesn't elicit anything at all. ""What time does this place close?"" ""What shoes are those?"" Maybe sometimes the conversation might extend. But sometimes the other person does not share any more information other than the answer. Basically, it would become an interview-mode conversation where I would feel dejected after 2 or 3 questions.

Other people seem to all effortlessly do it. Come in with a smile, joke about something situational or observational, then have a light-hearted conversation about it. I can't make any fun or sense of anything around me. I don't find anything around me interesting or funny or worth discussing. 

Most of these conversations are within short time-frames, so discussing about F.O.R.M/F.O.R.D or even just asking ""What do you study at school?"" will be pointless. And even if I asked that, the conversation mood would not be LIGHT or CASUAL anymore - it would be serious and logical in tone. I found that most ""cool"" guys or women do not respond positively to these conversations, especially when you're not someone of value to them.

What can I do?

Sometimes I use this to my advantage. Not for materialistic gain, but more of a personality/trust enhancer. If I'm talking to one of those friends about a subject that they already gave me info on, I will tiptoe around the subject to see if they still remember what they told me. If it doesn't seem like they remember what they told me, I will angle the information back to them in a way that they'd be amazed that I remember that from long ago, or simply fascinate them by making them think I'm an excellent ""people reader"".

&gt; Chat with the person when you make the delivery.
If the interaction is transactional, then the tip will be transactional (a set percentage). But if the interaction has some kind of emotive content, then you're more likely to get a higher tip.
So, make the guy laugh, flirt with the girl, any positive emotion flowing from you to them = higher tip.


Another user replied with:

&gt; I disagree. Assuming this is in America, people prefer short, automatic interactions when getting food delivered. Nobody cares what the delivery boy has to say and nobody wants to be hit on by him unless he's a 10/10.
Get there fast, bring extra condiments and napkins, ask if everything is alright, and be polite. Give them helpful tips about where you work if you can. That's all. You can't coax people into giving you a better trip by being friendly if you're a delivery guy. Also consider that the more time you spend chatting, the later you'll be for the next delivery, the fewer tips you'll get. The only exception is if they initiate it chatting or flirting.
I don't get why people in this reddit keep suggesting being overly friendly and chatty in places where it's generally (though of course with exceptions) inappropriate or unwelcome. It takes people outside their comfort zones or annoys them, neither of which is good.


While this may be the case for that particular user or where he or she lives (no offense meant; I understand that different people have different beliefs and mindsets), one huge notion that we all must take into account is:


**What works for you may not work for others.**


Or, to be precise: when you analyse a situation from a social engineering mindset, considering different perspectives is absolutely *crucial*.  People are different, and what you think is effective may not be effective at all to the majority of others.  And by *majority* I don't necessarily mean within your locality or social circle or the Reddit community, but the *majority* of the people you're dealing with.

Although America was mentioned in this response, sweeping generalisations are folly.  If this were a critical comment about America, it would have been downvoted into oblivion.  The diversity amongst the 50 states (and even within a single state) was not accounted for.

In the aforementioned scenario, this response could perhaps be explained in many ways, such as:

* The user and/or his or her social circle prefers short, transactional interactions and forgot to take into account the preference of others

* The user lives in a particular town, city, or region where short, transactional interactions are preferable

And for god's sake, don't reveal any identifying details.

Here's an excellent example: Paper shredding.

Many businesses don't bother having their own paper shredders. It's not cost-effective when you could just outsource it to a ""data destruction firm"" (read: outsourced custodians/janitors) that collects all that juicy, succulent financial data that's tossed into a bucket.

An unsecured, unmonitored bucket.

These same establishments usually have a few one-way 'secure' rubbish bins installed where you can put documents IN but cannot take them OUT without a key, but *noooooo*, I'm the bloody Director of bloody Human Resources, I don't have the time to walk ten feet out of my office and dispose of these documents with my punters' personal identification and credit card number on them because I'm a goddamned wanker~

Now, thirty sounds like kind of a lot, doesn't it? 

So many, in fact, that you might need to write them all down.

Don't.

Figure out a secure method of taking these notes. If it's on your phone, **ask yourself what would happen if an outsider picked up your phone and saw those notes, detailing all the ways that they could penetrate your company's integrity.** After you're done experiencing a mild coronary infarction, **please take the steps necessary to encrypt the data that you collect,** I'm not going to show you how to do this; some cursory research should point you in the right direction, but feel free to ask questions. *If securing your collected data is too much trouble for you, stop. Get out. Just get the fuck out. You are the ironic embodiment of what we are trying to exploit, and you have no fucking business being in here.*

Once you get into the habit of looking for these conveniences, you'll realize how often people do them in real life. This is what I'm really trying to teach you.

Good luck.

1372826841.0	1hjr4f	Newly hired manager is offered a shareable gift by the boss in front if staff. Should I share?	Sewards_Follicle	81	33	67	"I just started a job where I manage a small office and make twice as much as my closest employee. There are two full time staff under me and one part time. We are all female, I am probably the youngest of the group (with a fresh phd, the others have some college probably, mostly admin type work). My boss was in our shared office today and noticed I had did something well, better that my predecessor. He gave me a lot of praise and as the meeting ended offered me a case of wine he had in his office. He had meant it for a client, forgotten about it, and it was mine for the taking. So, naturally I said yes ( we work in wine country).

After putting the case in my car on my way out for the evening I thought about the other gals. They heard the offer and my acceptance. Should I, as a gesture of good will to my new underlings, offer to divvy up the case? Or should I accept my perk? 

I think sharing would endear me as an equal, but keeping it would draw the line that I am a superior. 

Edit: maybe I wasn't clear. The wine wasn't a reward for anything they helped me accomplish - it was an off hand gesture and they in no way contributed to any of the work he was happy about earlier in the meeting. I will take into account that I need to keep the condescension in check. Also, the wine is bottled on site and I had reason to assume everybody gets free wine thrown their way at some point. Literally free wine. 

Edit2: so I brought in the case and took a quarter of the bottles, the part timer is off for the week, data entry took two for guests since she doesn't drink and other person took the rest. I can see how the post came off as condescending but it wasnt my intent. They were all nice about it but It tuns out everyone gets free shit all the time there (as they explained to me). Grapes, berries, bottles of wine, whatever they have left over. So it wasn't some big coup for me to get this. I honestly haven't been in charge of people officially and next time I know this is the wrong sub to ask such questions. Thanks to those of you who had input and didn't call me a cunt!

How do you make the men/women in your life think and feel beautiful?

Apart from the on-the-job related aspects of SE, there is plenty of other interactions we have daily that are important to remember. 
Coming from a male perspective - mine - When at a party, or mingling with people I often try to work the room a bit, especially with women. One thing I love doing is making people not just think, but FEEL beautiful. Women spend alot of time on their appearance and I would argue many men do as well. How do we show them we appreciate it?

The trick is tailoring your approach in a manner relative to your relationship with that person, you certainly wouldn't use a more aggressive approach with someone you just met (it also depends on the situation (nightclub vs. dinner party). So to get the ball rolling:

Eye contact
A very important action to remember when dealing with anyone! It shows not only that you see them, but that if they are talking, you are listening. It shows respect and used in conjunction with other actions, sincerity. Its no secret that prolonged eye contact between two people, especially between men and women (and especially in an appropriate scenario) can signal interest, usually towards romance.

Eye contact was an easy one (and I didn't write enough about it to really flesh out its true power in social interactions) but we all know it is the basic tool that needs to be used to get the full effect of any other tip.

What do you do to ""aggressively"" (or subtly) give someone the impression that you see that they are beautiful. Hints? Lines? Gestures? Topics of conversation?

And I would love to hear the Female side of the equation, what do you do to men to show that you appreciate their beauty?"	t5_2qlud	True

It seems everywhere you go today, companies want to know your name, and sometimes a phone number, email or a zip code. Come up with a fake personality with all this data. Make them fake, but believable. Mind you, if you want the spam mail / email / calls, you need to give your real info. But most of the time you don't. They never ID you to confirm. Even if you pay with a credit card, they never notice the names don't match up!

OK, so now you have a retail alter ego. But you are gonna need more than that to convince others you are who you say you are. A believable backstory is key. How do you work on this? Go get a haircut!

I personally cannot stand strangers berating me with personal questions as if they care about my life. So feed them your alter ego!

Now I'm in the middle of reading [Hadnagy's very interesting book](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539).  So, thanks for that.  This is my new favorite subreddit.

Despite not knowing what social engineering was until a few days ago, I have an interest in propaganda as well as influence.  I've read [Cialdini](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X), [Bernays](http://www.amazon.com/Propaganda-Edward-Bernays/dp/0970312598/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325221859&amp;sr=1-1), and other interesting books in the past, and I recently read [Instant Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Influence-How-Anyone-Anything--Fast/dp/0316083348/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325221148&amp;sr=1-1), which I'd like to discuss, despite its corny promise that you can get anyone to do anything in 7 minutes...that's bullshit.  Essentially, the book says when you're trying to get someone to do something you should make sure they know that it's up to them to do ""x"", and then you ask them a series of questions to determine how likely it is they will do ""x"".  For example, one questions goes something like, ""On a scale of 1 to 10 how likely are you to do 'x'?""  Then the follow-up question is, ""Why didn't you pick a lower number?""  This gets the target to contemplate why they might be persuaded to do ""x"".  

Okay, so I tried it out on my cousin whom I want to be more ethical and less selfish.  I won't bore you with details.  I actually told my cousin I was going to try and influence him based on the concepts of the book, and I changed some of the wording to make it more easy to relate to (for example, I kept the 1 - 10 scale, but I prefaced it with, ""sorry, I know this is cheesy"").  I think the honesty worked, and overall it was successful.  He has since made positive changes in the way I wanted him to change; he's more ethically conscious in a general sense; he's less selfish and self-directed; and he now gets along with his father (my uncle).  

My qualms with the book is that it's written like a motivational speaking event, which is *super* corny.  But the concepts worked for me in this single example.  

I'm not sure if I did this ""field report"" properly, but I wanted to demonstrate my success with persuading my cousin, and I believe this report will suffice for what was requested by some of you.  If anyone wants more details, I will give them (unless they're too personal).  Anyway, I thought I'd get the ball rolling, and I hope others will do field reports.  Anecdotal evidence is always fun.  :)

**tl;dr I influenced my cousin to be more ethical and less selfish using the concepts from this book.**

This one is going to be a little different, it's offline so you'll have to go out and interact with people.

This is going to be a confidence building exercise, confidence is key when practicing SE. This is kind of a beginner’s exercise, so sorry to the more experienced folks. You may get value out of this somehow. 

As you are going about your daily routines this week, I want you to complete a set of tasks (or flags):

 * Make conversation with 5 strangers
 * Make eye contact with each stranger and try to remember their eye color.
 * If you forget someone's eye color, go talk to another person till you get it.
 * Take notes and save them for later.
 
Once you complete this set of tasks, I want you to go out and do it again, this time, don't do your basic hygiene (shower, shave, deodorant, etc) Post the results of both of these activities.

Some protips:
 
 * If you are a shy person, the best way to build up approaching strangers is to interact with someone who has no choice in the matter (cashiers, baristas, deli counter clerks, etc. No kidnapping!) If you are going to be doing this, try to interact a bit more with the person, ask them a question unrelated to what they are doing for you. Compliment them on something, ask if it's been busy, $sports_team's success/failure, etc. Post about this if you go that route.
 * Try to be pleasant with strangers. People generally are friendly unless you are acting strangely, so don't be weird, make the conversation pleasant and brief.
 * Know when to leave a conversation, if it gets awkward, wish them a good day and move on.
 * Have fun! If you aren't having fun doing this, then it isn't worth doing, or you are doing it wrong. 
 
If you are feeling bold or you are experienced, here is an added layer of challenge:

 * Find out each person's name and profession. 
 * Find out a hobby that this person has.
 * Gather information I haven't mentioned, if you can find where they live, what their alcohol preferences are, whatever. This is a hard one, basically get as much info as you can out of the person without appearing weird.
 * Include all these in your reply.
 
 Enjoy, and have fun :)

Two thought-provoking books on deception, face and body language.	curtains	53	11	8	"[Liespotting by Pamela Meyer](http://www.amazon.com/Liespotting-Proven-Techniques-Detect-Deception/dp/0312601875/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344819606&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lie+spotting)


[What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro](http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344819660&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+every+body+is+saying)


I read Liespotting a few months back, and once I finished I started playing a game with friends in which I would ask them to think of two true statements and one false statement to tell me, and I would try and pick out the false statement.  The first time I did it, I got it wrong.  After that, I have been able to guess the lie except for one other time.  I've done this game about twenty times, so I'd say my accuracy is actually higher than what most deception detection results reveal.  I think this is because the game I made up is a lot easier than detecting deception in the real world.  Nevertheless, Liespotting helped me view things from a better perspective.  You don't really have to read the later chapters in the book unless you are in business.  Chapters 1-4 will teach you what you need to know.



What Every Body is Saying showed up in a thread here in which pentestscribble, a redditor to whom I owe many thanks, brought the book to my attention.  Liespotting was a great book and you should read it, but WEBiS is a better book.  Even while I was reading it, I started trying out the techniques and found they worked.  



For example, my wife was talking to someone she knows I don't like one day, and I was watching their conversation (from a table...she was getting a drink at the bar).  Based on the book's teachings, I could tell she was uncomfortable and a little bit happy to be talking to this person.  They were close in the past, and she knew I was watching, so it wasn't surprising that she was giving mixed body language signals.  



Another example is that I was speaking to a new acquaintance (x) about one of her friends, and she started giving signals of being uncomfortable when she was mentioning a certain detail about this friend, but then stopped when the subject changed.  Furthermore, when another person (y) entered into the conversation and started critiquing x, x started using placating techniques (petting her legs) and one hand was clenched into a fist (indicating anger) for a good portion of y's critique of x.  It was fascinating.  



For anyone who wants to detect deception, you'll find that it's quite difficult.  However, you can deduce deception based on body language ""tells"".  It's important to baseline your target and get an idea of their idiosyncratic natures before trying to get a read on them.  Liespotting goes into better detail on this.  However, WEBiS is better about demonstrating why deception is hard to detect, and it uses better visual aids to demonstrate ideas than Liespotting.  



Liespotting cites more examples to scientific studies, but WEBiS demonstrates why the body does what it does (based on the Limbic System of the brain), and it still cites sources.  However, I am skeptical of certain portions of WEBiS because some parts (particularly with tells of the hands) don't have any science behind them.  


**tl;dr:  I recommend both books, but I think What Every Body is Saying is the better book.**"	t5_2qlud	True

How should I contact them to ask permisson?	talkr	64	20	20	"Since they have no real reason to, the company does not offer an API of any kind, making this a data request and parse situation. Luckily, their system is pretty robust already and not apt to change much at all.

How should I approach them with this? Their current app in the market has 3 out of 5 stars and has low functionality and is just very amateur overall. On their blog, they even mention how app updates are ""rolling out"", but that has stalled out for over 6 months now. On the other hand, they seem like a very progressive, forward-thinking, innovative company. They've held YouTube contests for publicity, for example.

This app has a lot of income potential, significantly more than their existing product. They don't offer a freemium model at all, mainly, which would drastically augment their income level for various demographic reasons. Most people would not pay for an app like this, so they are missing out on 3/4 of their market.

I have implemented many of the feature requests in their low rating comments. In an ideal world, they would just buy me out, but realistically if I can just take a royalty from the app's revenue that would be fine by me just as well. It would also be simple for them to Cease and Desist me and continue doing what they are doing, but they would miss out literally on 7 figures a year, instead of now where they are currently making a thousand dollars a month at best. (This app is in a niche that supports a yearly subscription-based payed version on the freemium model).

Any thoughts on how to approach this and try to partner with them? It turns out they are headquartered in my city, so I could meet in person in theory, but for practicality I can contact them through their website. I know it's bizarre and most of the time things like this don't happen, but I could really help their business and myself at the same time."	t5_2qlud	True

There are four stories out so far.

Ideally I'd like all my books to have several 4 and 5 star reviews, the more the better.

I've received about five fan emails telling me they loved the books. Each time I've written back thanking them, chatting a little, and asking them to please go leave a review wherever they got the book. Not one of these has actually followed through on that. 

Part of the reason might be reluctance/privacy issues, since the books are not something the average person would want to advertise that they're reading, but I also wonder if I'm going about this asking for reviews the wrong way -- if there's a better way to give people a friendly nudge to share with the world what they shared with me in email.

1369959036.0	1fdez5	my experience with social engineering today (long but worth the read)	supersmartfood	81	40	17	"I am a junior in my high-school, and since the year is coming to an end, there has been less and less work assigned to the point where i could miss several classes a day and encounter almost no problems. Anyways, today, while walking through the hallway to my next class, i spotted a group of kids touring the school for their first time (maybe from another high-school or middle school even), and leading them around the school, was a guy in his early 20's who i've seen only a few times around my school. As i walked a little farther, i saw another group of kids being lead by another man approximately 18 years old, most likely a former student. I asked one of the office staff what the tours were about and she said something along the lines of ""early orientation for the STEM program for kids from private schools or busy schedules"" and ""the tour guides were picked by the principal himself because he thought they demonstrated the most experience with the program; oooh! and they get pizza!"". I want pizza. 

Considering that i was also in the STEM program, and that my remaning classes for today were my two easiest classes (non-stem related, gym and photoshop), i had decided to ""help out"" with some of the tours today, discreetly. As my second period class ended, and the lunch/free period began, i rushed out to my car and drove to the kmart near the school. There, i bought a clipboard, a pair of glasses, and a blue landyard. All of the tour guides had been carrying a keyboard, the glasses were an extra touch, and the landyards were pretty close to the color of the tour guides, except they all had ID's on theirs. When i got back to the school, there was still about 35 minutes left of the free period and one bus was parked in the parking lot. When i walked in the school, there was a whole new group of kids here for the orientation which made my job that much easier. Instead of having to work my way into the list of the current tour guides, i could just hook up with this group. The kids were instructed to go to the auditorium and wait until the free period ended, then the tour guides would join them and lead their groups. 

I ran into the office dedicated to the program's department with a small slip of blank paper functioning as my ""hallway pass"", the secretaries and staff all knew me and mostly liked me. I said something along the lines of ""Ms.____ said there's a box of science textbooks in the closet that she forgot to label for next year"". They handed me the key and i went into the large walk-in closet that stored most of the department's supplies. On a shelf in the back, there was a stack of STEM navy blue polos, all ready for next year's freshmen. I didn't have the time to drive home to get mine so i grabbed a large sized polo and tossed it into an empty box. I was already wearing khaki pants so my uniform was complete. I walked out of the office carrying the empty box containing my polo (pretending it was heavy) and thanked the secretary at the front desk. I ran back to my car, changed, put on my glasses, and my landyard, with, once again, a blank piece of paper serving as my credentials (the ID itself stuck out of the shirt just enough to be visible to staff, but not enough for someone to see the whole thing. I walked into school with the clipboard in hand, containing a piece of paper with some newsletter-type information printed out and most importantly, the program's logo printed in color. The bell rang for third period to start, and the halls flooded with students, this prevented me from sticking out like a sore thumb as i made my way to the auditorium lobby where the rest of the tour guides stood, waiting for their tour groups to exit the doors. There were a few familiar, and surprised faces of students waiting, and several of them asked me what i was doing here, i said that the head of the program asked me to fill in for someone for the second half of the day because they would be short of tour guides. Nobody asked for credentials or even my last name (luckily)

We got our groups assigned and i did about 6-7 tours around the building. Being in the program myself, i knew about the rooms we were touring and had no problem talking about teachers and curriculums. At the end of the day, i enjoyed (lots of) pizza for the price of a clipboard, a pair of glasses, and a landyard. 
(Don't worry ill return the shirt)

I'd like to thank this subreddit for teaching me how to look the part and bullshit my way through serious situations to get what i want.  

EDIT: of course the whole thing wasn't just for pizza but more of a test for myself to see how far i could go with this whole thing. "	t5_2qlud	True

The other day I posed something regarding some social behavior that I had experienced and that I fond weird](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/zbz4q/why_do_people_get_angry_at_math/).  No need to check the original post, unless you want to.

What was interesting to me, is a comment made by **kiadel** where s/he said ***this paper explores people's tendency to defend their position in the face of evidence: http://www.springerlink.com/content/064786861r21m257/fulltext.html
In short, when faced with evidence, people usually just argue their own pre-existing point of view louder rather than learning something new.***

Which blew me away.  The study highlighted and confirmed what I had observed: people would vocally defend their wrong position, and if they confronted with evidences that they were indeed wrong, they don't change their minds and actually strengthen their original position.

Wait, there's more!  From the paper itself:

*We also document several instances of a “backfire effect” in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.*

Of course I see this though my own lens, and it makes no sense.  Does it?
I grew up introvert and shy, from what I see it's a pretty common occurrence. As a byproduct of that, as if introvert and shy was not enough, I was also insecure; actually I believe that shy if a form of being insecure; so I should say that I grew up introvert and insecure.  I am still introvert, but not that shy anymore, and not that insecure either, probably because I know a lot, and... I don't talk about stuff that I don't know.

And that's what puzzles me about the incident that I observed, people who didn't know what they were talking about talking out of context, being wrong, and very loudly defending their (wrong) position.

I have seen it happen a lot in business, where people who *know* are often overshadowed in meetings, rewards, and promotion by arrogant people who talk the talk, very loudly so, and not much more.

And I have seen these very same people who are introvert and shy and *in the know* working really hard for not much pay, in order to make millions for ... bosses and business owners who are clueless, who if they were left to their own doing, would be.... out of work.

And because of the work I do, and because of my social circle, I have seen first hands clueless people who could not do much, become entrepreneurs and despite themselves, striking it reach on the shoulders of shy and introvert people.

So, here's my question: are the shy and introvert by their own natured primed to learn more because they are open to being wrong, and to learn new things; while ... people who don't have those qualities learn from a young age to overcompensate what they lack in knowledge with their own social skills? And isn't this Social Engineering at its best?

And if we were to take someone like this, with little knowledge &amp; great social skills, who also happens to be a Sociopath, is this what constitute the majority of successful entrepreneurs who strike it rich in spite of themselves?

- [Wednesday] First, my girlfriend bought a table on craigslist and I had to go pick it up.


- I go to pick it up with two of my kids, and they ended up getting along with the their kid. 


- I talk to the Dad of the house for a minute while getting the table and find he's a marketing manager at a major company, and they're moving back to Kansas at the end of the month. I tell him that I'm an aspiring marketer, and want to consult for small businesses. 


- We talked a bit more about marketing, and towards the end as I was leaving he said I could email him with any questions I had, and that would answer them from Kansas!


- I left pretty excited! Normally I'd send him an email that night and thank him for the offer, and in this case the table too.


- [Friday] Instead, I have my girlfriend ask them if they want to come to dinner before they leave. This was my mistake, *I* should've done it, and I should've done it by phone (she did it by email, and a day too late). 


- They declined, and said they are much too busy (understandable).


- [Saturday] Now I have to figure out how to spark the relationship up. I don't want to bother him with any serious questions for at least two months, since he's moving away and will be busy with moving. I feel like I should send him an email that says thank you, so then if I ask him a question in a few months, he remembers me.

Do any of you have experience with games or exercises that can potentially help with SE?"	paralog	47	8	26	"Note: I'm sure there are several variations of the title and rules of this game. What follows is how it was taught to me. For those unfamiliar with the game, players sit in a circle and close their eyes. A facilitator taps people on the head to make them a murderer, a policeman, or an angel. Anyone untapped is a villager. Then the game begins.

Turns begin with everyone closing their eyes. The murderers are instructed to open their eyes and point at who they want to kill. The cops open their eyes next, and silently ask the facilitator if an individual is a murderer or not. The angel opens his eyes last and may protect one person from being killed. After this, everyone opens their eyes and the facilitator announces if anyone is dead. The remaining players are free to debate who the murderer may be, and vote to execute one person. A new turn then begins. 

In this game, I was a cop. I used my admittedly superficial understanding of body language to identify the murderers by the start of the second round, and later confirmed my suspects in future rounds. I pointed out the two likeliest murderers early on and was killed that night. The murderers ended up winning the game. Oh well.

I'm just amazed at how well this game simulates quickly understanding the emotional states of others in a stressful situation. The innocent villagers were sprawled back, making jokes and enjoying things. The murderers stuck out like sore thumbs by hugging their legs close, covering their center line, and wearing fake smiles. Playing this game make me realize that I'm good at assessing the comfort language of others, but could greatly improve my persuasive skills. I can't wait to play again to test my ability.

I can see this being somewhat useful to penetration testers practicing face-to-face empathy and persuasiveness, but I thought that a discussion of games like this would be interesting to the subscribers here who, like me, just have an interest in how people work and behave.

1342795627.0	wvimt	A moment to go over the importance and use of good questions.	ChristianBMartone	43	3	15	"The best way I've found to gain someone's trust almost instantly is to ask questions. Properly used, questions will lower their guard and even endear you to them. Poorly asked questions will kill a conversation (and your attempt at social engineering) quicker than a bullet to the head. Indeed, asking specific, and thought provoking questions is a simple and necessary art-form that takes a good social engineer to great.

The first brush stroke in this art form is choosing the right question to ask, and as expected, the first question will hardly ever be the same. The key, is to make the question about the mark. Write this down: people love talking about themselves. Remember, no matter what the question, you can spin it to get their view, and their favor. 

&gt;""Hey, I'd like to get this new phone. What are your favorite features?"" ""My favorite features are the (blah blah blah.)"" ""Wow. That's a little intimidating. Could you show me how you use that?""

Instantly, you've built trust and rapport. The proper execution and choice of question is important in the first stage. 

Poorly asked questions will kill the conversation, leading to disinterest and (albeit rarely) contempt. If your question isn't thoughtful, or sincere, or focused on that person's thoughts/feelings, they won't want to answer.

&gt;""I've been thinking about getting this new phone. What do you think?"" ""Oh, its great. Here are (features)."" ""What can you tell me about them."" ""(Feature statistics/details)"". 

The execution that doesn't emotionally or actively involve the mark leaves our interrogator with little ammunition later. Be wary of ""killer questions."" Stay focused on what you want, and how you want your mark to feel. 

Some keys to making your questions thought provoking and sincere can be found with a few quick google searches. Here, I'll provide some of my experiences, some general tips, and key engineering points.

* By asking questions, they must answer. Effectively, you've controlled the outcome (they must answer) and have a position of power. Asking the right questions in a stream of questions can get you answers you want. 
* Remember any details about themselves they get, and mention them in further questions, or ask follow ups about those details; ""oh, could you tell me more about your kids?""
* Ask for examples. If they have to give the thought to provide an example, the information you'll glean from it is likely to be more solid than an arbitrary off-the-cuff answer. 
* ""Tell me more about that,"" or ""Wow. What else is there to know"" are great options when you're stumped about what to ask next, or in fact don't know what else there is to know.
* Once you've developed a great rapport, ask questions like a friend or close associate might, still using the above keys.

This is all a sort of basic crash course on interrogation the way a social engineer should. Hopefully, you'll take away the importance of power in a conversation (and any edge over the other person, anything that tips the odds, is something that should be in your arsenal). Thanks for the time spent reading, stay classy /r/SocialEngineering 

**TL;DR:** Ask great questions and you'll be in control of the outcome. Stay interested. 


**EDIT:** I should have said this out of the gate, but this is just an attempt to cover *some* basics of good questions and how to use them advantageously, not an end all, be all, social engineering guide. As old and as populated as this sub is, we should be able to write a FAQ that can come close, but this post isn't it. Questions make up a small portion of total human interaction, and therefore, a small portion of total social engineering. This post wasn't about social engineering as a whole, and doesn't claim that asking questions precludes all other options. I've been getting a lot of messages about how ""If you want to social engineer, you can't just sit there and ask questions all day, hurr derp."" 

Duh.

Thank you, that is all. "	t5_2qlud	True

The other day we met some South African people and I noticed my friend start to mimic their accents (not in a piss taking way or anything, just like she had no control over it).

Whilst it was very subtle, I asked her about it afterward and she had no idea she had been doing it.

I work with quite a few Americans and some have a tendency to raise the end of their sentences which I have noticed is quickly infectious but  seems to 'wear off' just as fast.

I understand mirroring, but this seems like some other kind of thing maybe, is it simply 'novelty' or is there more at play?"	t5_2qlud	True

1345832054.0	yrl68	Best ways to create suggestion through questions?	NattyBroh	41	5	8	"If you're already familiar with injecting commands into questions, you can skip to the **TL;DR** at the bottom. Otherwise...

I was reading [Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345831076&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=social+engineering) about a year ago and one of the more interesting parts that I took away was how you can strategically use lower, command tones in questions so that the target thinks they're hearing a question, but subliminally is listening to a command.

To make a long chapter short, it basically talks about how when you're asking a question (""Where did you put the remote?"") your voice goes up in an inquisitive tone. But if you're giving a command (""Shut the front door."") your voice is firm and level. Human brains are hardwired to process questions, whereas they may easily ignore a command or statement.

So, the trick is to force the target to process the information you're delivering by making it sound like a question, but keeping key words in a commanding tone.

The example the book uses is something along the lines of trying to convince your wife that she wants steak for dinner by saying 

&gt;""What do **you want** for dinner? **Steak**, or chicken?"" 

with the bold words spoken in a lower, commanding tone. This way, she is forced to process the input because it is a question, but subconsciously hears the command 'You want steak.'

**ANYWAY** - I've been trying to refine this tactic since I first read about it, but find myself unable to make the commands long or complex enough to come out as questions and was hoping some of you could help. I generally find myself just adding 'Do' to the beginning of a command and it tends to come out strange sounding.

&gt;""Do **you want to go to the mall**?""

A better way to put this I suppose would be

&gt;""Where do **you want to go** this afternoon? **To the mall**, or the pool?""


**TL;DR** I guess my question is, does anyone have a better way to properly reform commands injected into questions other than giving two options at the end or just adding 'Do' to the front of the command (as in the examples above)?"	t5_2qlud	True

1338168128.0	u8143	How do I become both a boss and a friend?	becauseimadoctor	39	5	42	"I have been working for a few summers with the same people (more or less), and have been friends with about half of them until two years ago (we are all teenagers). That is when, because of my age, I was promoted to a leadership position of a department in which I had no experience. Even the people outside of my immediate lead have mostly worked there longer than I have.

I perform my duties of my job very well, I think, but because I am now in charge of people to whom I was once an equal, I feel that I have lost many of the friendships that I once had. I actually live with these guys during the summer (it is required), and I want to have relationships that go beyond just being a boss, but I feel that I have to sacrifice my power for friendship (or vice versa).

I have already tried being the 'cool' guy by being genuinely nice and lax, but I feel that it undercuts my authority and makes myself submissive, which leads to disrespect. However, I don't want to be the asshole boss with no friends around him (keep in mind that we're all teenagers and we all live together).

Is there any way that I can be both a boss and a friend to these guys? Even if you *don't* think it is possible, leave a comment so that I can stop deluding myself.

Rather than getting mad and blaming someone for their faults, how do you make them sympathize and want to make it up to you? I've noticed that when you accuse someone for their faults, instead of owning up to their mistake they will just fire right back at you.

In a simple world (with no tact) it would go like this:

* Student: Hey, you weren't at office hours yesterday like you said you would be. Because of this my homework is incomplete, I had many questions to ask.

* Teacher: You are right I'm sorry, keep it and turn it in with the next assignment. Take this week to ask me questions on the old and new assignment. I'll be in office hours I promise.

Realistically if you shoot the blame at someone it goes more like this:

* Student: Hey, you weren't at office hours yesterday like you said you would be. Because of this my homework is incomplete, I had many questions to ask.

* Teacher: I'm sorry I wasn't there but sometimes things come up and I can't be at office hours. I was in my office Friday you could have asked me then. Also you had the entire weekend to email me, next time manage your time better.

We're taking a suit (a dress for my friend), our laptops and smartphones. We have a full take of gas and $25 each. Basic toiletries and changes of clothing. We have my bank card, for absolute emergencies, but we're going to see if we can make it back on social engineering skills alone (getting free services through manipulation or mis-directions). We've done some pre-planning and have done a few hours of research, we think we have our hotels targeted. 

I don't know when we'll head out, but expect loads of fun pictures. 

I know not everyone can just up and go on a road trip, so for those who can't I suggest a 1-2 day version. Get to a town a few hours away, spend the night, and make it back without talking to anyone you know or spending over $25, or your own vehicle. I did this version of the challenge last night (using some great tips from the thread on getting cheap hotels) spent my full $25, had dinner paid for me, and took a limo home. It can be done!

Again, I'm trying to make these more difficult, although I know everyone here is at different levels. Feel free to try past challenges or suggesting alternatives in the comments, and wish me luck.

Someone in my life and home is in an unfortunate position of being able to ruin my life and possibly make me homeless.  Tonite I came home and found myself locked out of access to my possessions in a shared part of the abode that I live in.  Parked nearby the house was a rent-a-truck that was the PERFECT size for carrying away my stuff.  (Yes I am completely up on my rent agreement).  

I immediately wrote down all the information that was on the truck, license plate, truck number, etc. - then called the cops.

The moment it was obvious to the perpetrator that the cops were coming, the truck suddenly, mysteriously vanished.  The perp hid in the house, called someone, and the truck zoomed off.

The suspicious person gave the cops plausible deniability (claimed they were storing valuable stuff for someone else and wanted to lock that room for a day).  The perp left no notice letting me know that.   The  cop did a good job of calming both the scary person down (for now) and explaining that he thought was just a civil case.  The only shred of proof otherwise would be that magically disappearing truck.  Yes, it could be a coincidence, but dammit, it was waaaaay too much of a coincidence.

Since I have the license place, and the truck number, how do I find out who actually rented the truck?  Yeah, for all I know it was rented with a stolen credit card or whatever, but I need a place to start.

If any social-engineering genius could either explain how to call the truck company and get the identity of the real renter out of the truck-rental company, I'd be REALLY grateful (and maybe less scared).

My next step after this would be to somehow be able to flee the perpetrator and the unhealthy living situation, but I have no money for that right now... I just need to survive the situation however I an until I can escape to a safer living space.

I am in a western state in the USA.

I'm noticing a recurring obsession with understanding how systems work and how to break them. Has anyone else seen this pattern in their childhood hobbies? and if so what was it?

For example, underneath roadway overpass structures there are spaces created unintentionally that can serve as closed in shelters for homeless people.

I looked up 'reverse engineer' but this means something different. Would a generic term like 'systems hacking' be a good one?

Social engineering is systems hacking but pertains to the human element instead of inanimate things. 

Also, what are some principles or rules of system hacking? Here are a couple I've been thinking about:

-All systems are finite and therefore have a finite capacity. Once this capacity is reached within a system then it no longer can function properly and is prone to errors. This causes vulnerabilities in the system that can be exploited.

-All systems are human constructs and are models that exist only in the human mind. The human mind is limited in its perception of all the nuances of a given system. In fact, the human mind may only work with a very small aspect or sub-system of a much larger system.

-All systems are dependent on its smaller parts so much so that an error in one miniscule aspect of the system can crash the system. Put another way, knowledge of the whole system isn't necessary to hack it.

I posted a similar initial question in /r/personalfinance, but I was hoping some social engineering on the phone would help me out.

I will be discussing a settlement with a collection agency tomorrow afternoon.  They're offer to settle the debt was $19,000 (a pretty big discount on my original debt).  I would like to offer them $16k since that is all I can manage to scrape up right now.

I know that taking my offer would guarantee them money, whereas declining it could potentially mean they get nothing, but I don't know how low of a lump sum is too low in this situation. It's possible that they'll say, ""Best I can do is $18,000,"" and then what? I just keep pushing the 16k?  Do I threaten to not pay at all or say something like, ""I'd really like to settle this debt without a payment plan""?

I just don't know how to approach making that offer.  I'm worried that if I just flat out say, ""Here's what I can do,"" then I'll end up in a ""Well, we can't take that, but since you seem to have plenty of cash on hand, let's set you up with a payment plan,"" situation.

Yes, I can make payments, but I'd like to settle this and not deal with an outrageous interest rate on a large student loan.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to tackle this phone conversation? I'm not good at negotiating, and I'm pretty passive in general, so I want to be as prepared as possible.  I also don't have any room to go past $16,000 because that's already including selling tons of stuff on eBay over the past week and borrowing $2,000.

----------------

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for reading this long post and giving great advice.  So far, everyone has pretty much said to offer them a low amount and hold my ground, offering to push the payment through as soon as I receive the agreement in writing.  If they don't take it, let it slightly increase as the end of the month approaches so that they'll be more willing to settle at whatever they can get since they are on a month-to-month goal/commission.

Show that you hate parts of yourself (whether or not you actually do).	winndixie	52	23	25	"Especially when you are successful, people want to see problems that you have. This is the ""crabs in the bucket"" phenomenon. Certainly, this is not to say one should think less of himself, but rather, deep inside know that you are doing well. The trick is to hide this in public.

This is great, because not only do you get to hide what might make people feel inferior, you get sympathy to solve your smaller problems, because you have your bigger problems under control.

A simple application of this is self-deprecating jokes. But they are too obvious and are seen right through. They are like facebook selfies of a girl who spent the time to put on makeup, strike a pose, and filter through all bad images, to finally post and say, ""OMG, I'm so ugly"" to garner sympathy. What I am saying is not say self-deprecating lines, but BE almost self-defeating, conflicted, and self-deprecating.

i.e. You just received a new promotion. Say you got a new promotion, but the more you rub it in people's faces, the more resentful they grow. Trick is to also vent your problems: This promotion sucks because it means you have to stay an extra 3 hours to finish your work. You gotta manage new people, and you hate managing people. But how can you refuse a $30,000 increase to your salary?? Gain sympathy. Brag more. Rinse, Repeat. The bottom line is, you are overtaking those who earn less than you, but you do not want to be hated.

Another example: You just got into an ivy league college. Show negative aspects of it: ""Fucking rich ass people in ivy leagues, I hate them."" ""It's far away from home, I'm not gonna be here anymore."" ""Everybody in ivy leagues are uppity and think they are better than everyone.""

This solves many problems: those who resent you will feel better about themselves, knowing that you too, hate certain aspects of what defines you. People who love you will give you attention for being controversial: ""but YOU are one of them!""

This also lends itself to usage of the Benjamin Franklin effect. Want to get closer to a new buddy? Take him out to lunch and vent your problems. Ask for his advice on how to handle ""managing people""; you've never done it before, people don't like you, etc. The gold is maybe you would actually gain genuine advice and a perspective you haven't thought of.

But more importantly, this let's you continually brag more about your promotion in a bigger group without people resenting you and going ""we've heard enough!"" It gets people to sympathize and respect you simultaneously.

Be humble, but take it a step further. Be inferior. Get people to pity you. According to Robert Greene, an inferiority complex is favored over a superiority complex. Of course, you don't actually believe yourself you are less than others; but you convince others that you are.

This is not lying. Nobody can prove how you truly feel about your new job or promotion, as long as what you say is based on facts. This is mere social manipulation.

This allows you to slip through the cracks and be on top without people stomping on you.

One of the main reasons I keep up with y'all, though, is because I worry that I may be using social engineering techniques on accident.  

My dad definitely social engineers. He is incredibly charismatic, and is pretty blatant about lying and manipulating strangers to get what he wants. I recently realized that while I don't do the blatant lying (I rarely lie, really), I was getting a lot of the results that he does. An example of this would be two weeks at the airport -- I got to talking to the baggage lady while checking in, and she decided to not charge over-weight fare for my check-on luggage. Or the fact that my professor recently re-opened my midterm online for me because I missed the deadline.

So my question is: is it possible for social engineering to rub off? Am I doing it unintentionally? Am I even social engineering? I never see someone and think, ""Gee, I'd really like to manipulate them into helping me."" I normally just kind of start talking to them, and then I request something, and then they give it to me/help me. The most I'll do, normally, is not admit the whole truth if necessary. I'm an 18 year old female; I typically am super-friendly, and will act pretty ditzy sometimes just to gain sympathy, but that's it. I would chalk it up to me being a girl, except that women help me a lot too."	t5_2qlud	True

I try to keep them harmless; Like talking a friend into dying her hair blonde although she hates blondes and hair dye.  Bringing up military history with cops who just happen to have served as well. 
All little things that just require a change in perception and a reason for people to work with you. 

My concern though is that sometimes I use romance as a tool for benefit. I recently had to end a fledgling relationship with a girl because I found myself using her to pull someone else along. I was horrified with myself when I realized my secondary reasoning behind my actions and try to end it smoothly....
But where does one socially cross the line?  
How does one safely use romance as a tool? 
At what point does the integrity of someone else's decision make the gain, a loss? 
If I charm 2/3 managers, and then use them to over-ride the decisions of the other...Am I engineering negativity?

1347654745.0	zw7j8	Results from profiling challenge	wat_waterson	36	7	17	"So it's been about a week since the profiling challenge was posted, it looks like everyone had fun except the one guy that deleted his comment (not sure what that was about ;) ) It ended up getting away from me and I had a busier week than expected. What I took away from this thread is that wrangling you guys is like herding cats. 

Some rockstars were up in that thread taking care of up to 5 requests.

/u/indian_suzuki profiled at LEAST 5 users and the feedback that was posted was that he/she was very accurate

/u/weasel_b put up a challenge to find his mother's maiden name, not sure if /u/Nattfrosten  got it or not, but apparently he has a million upvotes coming his way ;)

/u/The_Wisest_of_Fools ended up with an Icelander's almost full contact info

/u/Obviously-trolling was all up in the thread as well, by my count he profiled 3 users.

/u/dontmindmeimdrunk profiled me and pulled out a lot of info, from an obscure comment someone else made in a low traffic subreddit in reply to me; he had a lot of my information. 

So what's the point of all this? /u/tacticalintel, the winner of seCTF two years running put it best in his AMA:

&gt;More on the dossier - you want to profile your target's hobbies, friends, etc so that you can drop items in your conversation that can help you build rapport.
If you are targeting a company the dossier's role helps you identify internal lingo, acronyms, policies, culture, rumors, etc. Very helpful information.

Gathering information is the most important step in a social engineering engagement, or in most offensive engagements of this sort (pentesting) Having a full dossier of your target gives you a great edge. Armed with this information, you can figure out the best line of attack, build rapport and really engage the target. With Twitter and Facebook reaching more people every day and people's willingness to post all of their PII on these sites, if you aren't gathering information that's basically spoon fed to you, you're not gonna go far.

From my perspective, if you accept the premise as truth and explicitly say ""even if we accept what you're saying as true"", the other might be more receptive of your next claim (that the conclusion is still false). On the other hand, it sets a poor precedent in that you're allowing the other to create more flawed premises down the road. The flip side is obviously to say ""what you're saying is flawed"", namely challenging the premise.

if they are confused, take them,
If they are substantial, prepare for them,

If they are angry, disturb them,
if they are humble, make them haughty,
if they are relaxed, toil them

I have to believe that in any trust-relationship there is a degree of risk. We're risking failure, humiliation or otherwise - we're hoping confidential information is not given away. We're hoping for success by allotting duties or activities to those we need help from.

I think it's interesting that we could build a trustworthy relationship within a very small amount of time. We can get people to 'let us in', even only after a few moments of interaction.

and

* ""Nah I don't want do (insert job here), because (insert talented guy here) can do it way better than me anyways, why bother""

So here's what were going to do this time around: Profile the user, figure out relevant information from their posting history and **PRIVATE MESSAGE** the user with everything you dug up, as well as how you would go about social engineering that user. The user being profiled now has a job, their job is to rate the profiler on their findings, bonus points for finding out information off of Reddit regarding your information.

**If you are participating in this thread, be prepared to have your history examined and analyzed. Should be common sense. This may be NSFW, depending on the user your profile, so be warned!**

I'll go first since I was profiled last night and the user PM'd me:

dontmindmeimdrunk was able to find and categorize most of my personal information. He was able to find out my first name, my blog, my twitter because of a reply from another user in a thread where the user named me for my real handle. He picked up a false flag I had planted (sorry, I don't have my concealed carry or own a gun ;) )

Overall 10/10, great job! Finding my offsite information was awesome and I was worried when that user called me out with my real handle that someone would figure it out ;)  I did not get how you would go about social engineering me, you can either post that here or PM me.

**edit: Guys, this won't work if we have more people volunteering to be profiled than people profiling. If you are volunteering and have free time, look at one of the other users who haven't been addressed yet (you can tell by the person profiling them replying to their comment) Let's work together on this.**

""The Google lifestyle:
Food at Mountain View in the early days was great. Things got a bit
crazy when Charlie was cooking in the same tiny kitchen that he had
cooked for 70 people in when there were something like 400 people
eating in the cafe, although the food quality didn’t go down nearly as
much as I would have expected it to. But this was just one of many
examples of overcrowding in the offices that happened over the years
at Google. (And honestly, keeping the cooks happy seemed like a good
idea to me…)

But along with the food came the Google lifestyle: if you were staying
for dinner, it better be because you were working afterwards. It was
frowned upon to leave right after dinner. I think a lot of people
spent quite a bit of time either just before or just after dinner
hanging out and not really being all that productive, which is nice
for the mostly 20-something crowd, but I can sympathize with the
people who have families that didn’t fit in. I had my own reasons for
not wanting to hang out at work, so I never really got that far into
the Google social scene. And my experience was that the people who
spent all their time at Google were the ones that ended up on the
sexier projects or in charge of things. (Admittedly, some of these
people were also workaholics, and I wasn’t willing to give up some of
my non-work social activities, but there seemed to be a bit of
favoritism going on as well.)"""	t5_2qlud	True

Thanksgiving is coming up, and I have scheduled a flight with my family for that week a good 3 months in advance.

Our school was closed for Hurricane Sandy, so the entire course got pushed back a week, which now means that the Midterm is the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

I wrote my professor an email as soon as I realized and his reply was:

""No [elvesandems],

Exams are rescheduled only for documented family and medical EMERGENCIES.

 [Prof's First Name]""

So how do I convince him to let me take the exam at a different time?
Should I ask to see him in person?

How do I best approach this?


UPDATE:

I sent my prof an email that pretty much followed mail124's suggestions, I said that my original plans didn't conflict with the exam date, and the hurricane caused that. I ended the email with:
""I understand that your time is valuable, and I do not mean to burden you more then necessary, but I was hoping that you can make any sort of exception or alternative.

May I come in to discuss any alternatives in person?""

Like you guys were saying, he really didn't want to go out of his way to meet in person. He said: 

Yes everyone was inconvenienced because of Sandy. But attendance is mandatory for this course. So plans to miss two classes should not have been made in the first place. I plan to put up answers as soon as the test is over, and I won't make you a separate instance of the exam. So unless you can do it Monday when I would have finished the exam, there is no other way to resolve the situation.

So I agreed to do it on Monday. Yes, I will have to reschedule the flight anyway, but Monday makes the trip two days short, as Wednesday would cut the trip in half.

  I am a published photojournalist, with front page photos on the cover of the Observer Tribune, and the Mount Olive Chronicle (newspapers in New Jersey). In addition to this, I have charity auction sales totaling over $6,000 dollars. These photographs were of the fine art variety.

1. bring a few coins wherever you go.

2. when you want a cigarette, scope out a suitable candidate. 
2a. the best candidate is a male smoking with a female, although larger groups will work almost as well, single folks are least effective yet still highly effective.

3.  offer them a few coins for the cigarette.

4. they say ""oh dont worry about it, thanks for offering tho i appreciate that a lot!"" they hand you a cigarette.

why it works best with males standing with a female: the male will try to appear to be a generous companion, one who is empathetic and altruistic.  this means he will turn down your money and give you a free cigarette to impress a potential mate. 

put some time into scoping out your target, either way you will likely get a cigarette, as someone will likely take the change if they dont refuse it.  in my experience, far far far more often than not they will refuse the change.  

just make sure to not do it to the same person multiple times!  

note: items for trade also work.  
   example: the rest of your sandwich, a granola bar, a bracelet, etc.

AND REMEMBER: what goes around comes around, so don't do this too long without expecting karma's wrath.

edit: my responses from some comments

the TRICK is that it usually ensures success in that many people get tired of bumming constantly, as so often happens in a place where smokers congregate. by offering a trade, it shows a sign of understanding and respect, and most people do not care so much about 35 cents as they do the gesture of offering.

I figured since I just got here I would tell a bit about my adventures with physical access in downtown L.A. in the 2001-2003 era. I don't know why, but somehow while living in the area I ended up on a Sunday walk downtown, and was immediately mesmerized. You would think, that Sunday in downtown in one of the most populous regions of the United States that there would be lots of people... Not the case at all. It was barren, it was a random stranger either walking to what was sure to be a long work on a Sunday or back from a long nights work, or a homeless man just out for some change.

It soon became my adventure land. I would go from building to building each weekend, see what I could explore and see, and what I couldn't. I learned that if you can make it past a front desk without being questioned, you can get into just about any high-rise there is. Get stopped?

Most public transport in cities nowadays use magnetic cards (nfc, rfid) for, which have to be checked for validity when entering the bus. If the card works, the machine will make a beep sound (which is for everywhere I've been just 1 tone), when it fails it beeps at a lower frequency.

Because of the magnetic system, it's possible to leave the card in your wallet and it will still work most of the time. That way you don't always see the card, but when the driver hears the beep he assumes it's ok.

The sound can easily be reproduced by a small handheld device, like a smartphone. It suffices to reproduce the same sound in software like audacity and play it on your smartphone. (people with a good ear could guess the frequency maybe, otherwise it's easy to record and do an fft analysis).

The trick then would be to get your smartphone ready (start up audio player, pause) and hold your wallet and smartphone where you're supposed to hold the card and press play (make sure the soundlevel is high enough) and if all goes well you're in for free."	t5_2qlud	True

Surpa	23	9	7	"My coworkers and I have noticed something about our boss and how he interacts with us, and I think it might be worth throwing my thoughts and experiences with this out here. This almost specifically pertains to stuff after we mess up but here they are anyway.

Whenever we mess up, whether it be breaking a $100 part, pissing off a customer, or forgetting to clock in, etc. he always has this way of speaking to us that injects us with a desire to immediately become better in the aspect we failed. He never threatens to cut our pay, or to fire us, he speaks to us in a calm manner and stresses how bad our messup is. At the same time it doesn't exactly feel like we're being accused of anything, or that we're being threatened. We just know we did something wrong, we feel responsible for it, and (and this part I feel is why it's so effective) we feel a desire to change ourselves.

It's really strange, he gives us a guilt trip with very little feel guilty about. I'm not sure if it's the worry that he might do something that upsets us, or if it's knowing that we upset him. But in the end we feel a desire to change and make things right.

Anyway just my thoughts, I'm sure someone smarter than I can explain the effectiveness or possible exploitation of this in greater detail. But there you have it.

Anyway, after a while it seemed that not many people were eating much of either of these dishes. As I was mingling, I noticed most people were grabbing chips out of the nearby bags, and dipping them in either option, and making various faces, then moving on.

I re-arranged the table somewhat, in an effort to fix the situation. The graham crackers went between the sweet dip and everything else (and a little further away from the chips), and the faux mashed potatoes got moved in between some baked beans and coleslaw (other foods you traditionally dish with a spoon vs dip chips into (although pros dips potato chis into baked beans)).

1346982720.0	zhes0	I am a habitual liar, and I have perfected the art.	BigFatLiar321	36	22	26	"I have been a liar my entire life, and as such, I have learned the most effective and strategic ways to lie.

The first pointer is obvious: Your lies are very dependent on your audience.

Paired with the second pointer: Lying is very dependent on your improvisational skills or readiness. It is always best to prepare for any question that could arise from your lies. Since I am mediocre with improvising, sometimes I spend hours thinking of responses to each and every important question that could be posed.

However, the real secret lies in the first-pointer. Always be aware of your audience. If you are lying to someone who is genuinely interested, they are going to ask more questions. They are going to ask specific questions, and they are going to want answers. The most effective way is to be prepared.

However, in the case that you are not prepared, *make your audience lose interest*. Lying is not about confidence, it is not about selling that you actually did something. Lying is about distracting your audience from the holes in your story. 

I find the most effective way to distract your audience, is to disappoint them. Positivity generates interest, Negativity generates disinterest. Disinterest allows you to cut the cord on a lie when needed. You will be forced to brush off lies if you are unprepared.

Your best back-up brush off move is to feign discomfort discussing the topic. When your lie is negative, almost all of the time, people will not push you to discuss a topic you aren't comfortable with.

There is offensive lying (being prepared for questions posed by a positive lie) and defensive lying (always having an evasive maneuver prepared).

I am more honed in defensive lying, to escape responsibility.

The best technique is to use body language, and visible indecision to lead-on discomfort. When you show discomfort, people may drop the subject, and do your job of distracting the conversation for you. If not, feigning discomfort atleast allows for time to formulate a response to their inquiries.

As a liar, you must always be thinking of additions to your lie to satisfy your audience. Regardless of whether the topic is still present or not, it may be brought up again.

Which brings me to my next point: Memory

Memory is the single most important factor to lying. If you cannot remember your lies, you are a fish in a barrel if you are caught off-guard.

Dependent on the severity of the lie, the time range which you must remember said lie varies. A serious lie must be remembered for months, staying in the back of your mind, ready to emerge when that one person decides to bring it up.

Insignificant lies can be trashed after a month. If anyone brings it up, you can claim ignorance, and blame it on your memory or apathy of said subject. Make sure you attempt to make the inquiring party unsure of whether or not you actually ever uttered the words. However, after offensively questioning the integrity of *their* memory, feign defeat.

**Never don't know.** 

Not knowing is a signal that you are unsure of your claims, making your audience question the integrity of your claims.

In absence of not knowing, use the ignorance card again, but due to faulty memory. ""I don't remember."" When you use this defensive mechanism, remember to back it up with plausible confirmation. Allow your audience to make up your own fake story, and faintly remember something along the lines of that.

When you claim that you don't remember, your audience will not penalise the integrity of your claim. They will however judge you as someone who forgets things easily. This defensive mechanism is not to be overly used. People will believe that your memory is not great, they won't believe you have Alzheimer's.

Another defensive mechanism is to prove your integrity. Intentionally lead on that you are lying, push so far that your audience will confront you. When they confront you, you will be prepared to prove them wrong *with acceptance*. Be understanding of how they could have misconstrued your actions or claims. Temporarily luring them into a false sense of trust in you.

The last pointer is: Lie to yourself. The best way to execute lying is to appear as if you are as comfortable with the lie as the truth. Lie to yourself on the outside, but know on the inside that your lie is false.

Have fun lying everyone. People are easy to manipulate for your benefit, if they are not wary, they deserve to have the wool pulled over their eyes.

Bribing your way into a restaurant, as demonstrated in a recent post, is too simple, and this should be a *challenge*. I personally have gotten into several exclusive restaurants with these handicaps, so I know its possible. It will take some real creative social engineering, and some work well before the actual dinner. Good luck, and report back here. 

Disclaimer: This is in no way encouraging anyone to con a restaurant or to steal service. It is simply an exercise in social engineering tactics with the purpose of receiving VIP treatment. Have fun, stay safe. :D

I don't really have many friends that talk to her, but we both have a best friend in common. 

So two things! One, what exactly should I do to make my former friend more receptive of my attempts at bridge building? Two, how can I leverage our mutual friend to help this situation?

About our fallout:

&gt;She's actually the one who made me mad, she was shit talking me behind my back and spreading a bunch of lies about me and I found out about it. I tried confronting her about what she said and she wouldn't admit to it. I was a little overbearing as a friend, trying to force her into doing things that I felt were for her ""own good"". And I realize now that's not my place to do that to people.. 

I don't even care about what she did that much anymore, but I don't really understand why she's mad at me. I mean I apologized to her for being overbearing, but hatred seems a little extreme for my misguidedness. She also claims that all I ever did was make her miserable. "	t5_2qlud	True

The paper will be based on a social experiment I'm running. It's basically about trusted relationships and how social engineers manipulate them. Specifically in social media.

I put together this website.

www.theinternetistrue.com

The premise is basically that I've found we're more likely to trust unknown content coming from social media than we are from email. We're trained to not open suspicious documents and such in email because we know they might be viruses. We're quick, however to just click randomly on links we've never heard of if they show up in our facebook feed.

If this link was tied to a status update like:

""IRON MAN 4 PREVIEW LEAKED!"" - I'm sure someone would click on it - in this case it's safe but a bad guy could redirect you to something bad. Get it? 

We're more likely to just randomly click stuff based on the trust we have for social media because we apparently know the people posting. What if my account got hacked and the bad guy was posting AS me... there's no way for you to tell.

I'm trying to find a few companies / users who would spread this link on their Facebook pages as part of the experiment - you'd be mentioned in the talk and put on some kind of 'supporters' page if your company can contact me after posting - I'd love to get a screen grab of the post itself..."	t5_2qlud	True

We are a small group of airsoft players in a small city, and we are looking for a terrain. Finding a large space to play is ridiculously hard, and we cannot afford playing on professional fields weekly.

We have spotted a scrapyard on the outskirts of the city. They have a fantastic terrain right next to the scrapyard that we'd like to rent on the weekend.

**Our disadvantage:**

* Our sport is associated to the military and to violence
* We have very little budget
* We could injure ourselves

**Our advantage:**

* We can enforce an age limit
* We can charge 5 to 10 bucks to play. That's about 160$ tops.
* We can get people to sign a waiver
* Unlike paintball, it doesn't leave a mess behind, save for biogradable 6mm plastic BBs

I dropped it this morning and the screen is broken. A repair is $90 and I'd prefer to get a slight upgrade of a phone instead of spending that much just to repair the one I have.

What are some ways I can possibly achieve this at this price point? A little background info: I always pay my bill on time, I'm willing to renew for an additional 2 years, we recently increased my wife's data plan, and I've never gone over my data. Are there good customer benefits from which I could potentially strike a deal? Do you have any other advice on how to carry out this goal?

[**Update**] I called Customer Retention, as recommended by ClamatoMilkshake, and after talking with a couple different people, I got great results. Free upgrade to the Atrix HD. No charge on the phone, waived the contract renewal fee, and got free overnight shipping. This proves what I have learned more than anything about social engineering. If you are kind to people and speak with them respectfully and patiently, while still making your wishes clear, you can get pretty far, while making someone else's day better.

I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of social engineering, but it's almost impossible to apply it.

* I use language literally, and often completely miss metaphors and innuendos. Oddly, I seem to catch all the innuendos that other people miss, but miss the ones most people catch.

* I stutter quite badly sometimes (not in the way most people think of stuttering). I'll stop in the middle of a word or sentence and be unable to finish it unless I start the whole thing over. This happens at wildly variable rates - sometimes it's every other sentence, sometimes not at all. It feels like forgetting how to use my mouth.

* I am almost incapable of looking someone in the eyes while talking to them. I can do it for brief periods (1-5 seconds), but if I try to maintain it, I completely lose my train of thought. I can't pay attention to what they're saying, and I forget what I'm saying mid sentence.

* I can barely understand some people's speech. If someone has a heavy accent, I usually avoid talking to them because I'll miss over half of what they say. It comes through as unintelligible babble. Often, after thinking about it for a while (several hours later, usually), I'll suddenly understand what they said. Media is no exception to this.

These things can come off as extremely rude, but I feel helpless to change them. I offended a friend the other day because I didn't catch his hints that I shouldn't talk about a topic any more. I'm becoming more and more isolated because it's a lot of work to deal with people, and I'm afraid I'll offend someone. This isn't just ""social anxiety"", this is completely failing to understand how social interaction works. I usually only get along with other people who have Aspegers.

I want him to:

* drop the alc (most important, it's destroying him)
* dropping trees and cigs would be a plus, but not an immediate concern
* take up meditation or something similar so he'd start to learn about himself and face his shit
* alternatively, take up psychotherapy (he's got issues, but he doesn't talk about them)
* get a hobby that doesn't have to do with drugs
* get a generally positive outlook on his life (preferably by doing the above things), I hope the kid contributes to that
* ...?

I'd need a book that I can read in his presence that gives self improvement advice in this vein, and isn't too complicated - he is not an intellectual and he doesn't read a lot, only when he has a specific need.

Lurkers and other such beginners, now is the time to post; what do you want to see covered early on?

Advanced members: What would have helped you most had you learned it earlier?

Anyone: anything else?

I think its pertinent to introduce the various definitions of Social Engineering at the beginning, to define both its function and applications honestly. I'd like to take that time to stress that manipulation is a device to an end, and that it is the ends, not the means, that is qualified with morality. Social engineering is a tool, and it has the weakness inherent of all tools: its user. Agree, disagree, why or why not? Just my idea of the beginning.

And of course, I'm very biased, as she is my daughter. But she is really sweet in an innocent kinda way, has tons of friends, and is very, very popular. Not in a bitchy teen kinda way, but in a 'I don't care about makeup, and simply hang out and play soccer and videogames with ALL the girls and boys of my age at school' kinda way.    
    
But, she has been somewhat picked on by bullies. Particularily when approaching/befriending girls who are part of girl groups with dominant alpha queens.  This has happened twice. The alpha queen little bitches of those groups have then been threatened by her, and have been mean to her. Like spreading rumours, and punishing the girls that want to hang out with her by pushing those girls out of the group, thus freezing/pushing her out.    
    
Now she is just about to begin sixth grade in a new school, and I know for a fact that several girls that have been part of those groups will be there, and know each other since before. So there is a chance that this ugly situation will rear it's ugly head again.    
    
So I'm looking for advice here. Is there any strategy I could somehow pass on to my daughter to make her avoid that trap? Like being low-key at the beginning when being introduced to a new group, something like that? The issue is further complicated by the fact that she is only 11 years old. So I need some simple strategy that she can understand/grasp, and that doesen't seem to manipulative."	t5_2qlud	True

Their is multiple forums dedicated to this, and it's funny, how amazon, to this day, is still being social engineered for kindles (Multiple years, these people caused millions of dollars in lose to amazon, but amazon doesn't really care other then to blacklist the address and virtual credit card).

Here are some of the things I found

To obtain a kindle, they would register a serial (Made from a generator) and register it to their account, then request for a replacement. They would social engineer amazon reps to convince them to make a replacement order, however amazon will sometimes send them to a replacement team (On suspicions), then ban the account.
Amazon caught on to this when they released the new Kindles, preventing people from registering it on the site, and now people have to resort to contacting customer chat. Serials cannot be generated at great amounts, according a developer at one of these social engineering forums.

They would shipping claim companies and claim the item never came, and again, Amazon is the easiest known for this, as they often times never put a investigation unless it's a very high amount.

Heres what these people tend to abuse
-Cross Shipping (They would ship a empty box, then recieve the product, but by the time you got a empty box/dud box, they would already get the product)
-Advanced Replacement/Rma (Oftentimes, a company would not put a full hold on a credit card/debit card, then try to charge it if you didn't return it. They would just use a Virtual Credit Card with the amount the company would pre-authorize, then abandon it, the company would not be able to get any money. Sometimes companies offer advanced replacements without even asking for a CC)
-Boxing (This is a standard rma/replacement, they would show a doctored receipt, return for a repair/replacement, but they would use items such as dry ice, or ice, so the box would lose its weight, as if it got ""stolen"" in transit, and they would social engineer the company for a replacement) This is commonly used with apple. 
-Simple Complaining (This is done with Food, most companies will just send you a manufacturers coupon or a the food itself, if you just complain to them via email or phone, tell them you got sick etc. This one isn't really damaging)

Notable Attacks
-Amazon Kindles, and this one still continues to this day, although it isn't as widespread and massive.
-Sony TV's. Sony must've have a LOT of money for these, as from what I've heard, they took like 5 minutes phone calls and a virtual credit card, and a generated serial (Apparently they didn't even check the serials), and sony would ship replacements. Their was plenty of services on the forums for these, and it would be 50$ for 500$ tv's, or even tv's worth several thousand dollars. Was patched, I bet sony's insurance company was not happy.
-Logitech is generally being defrauded, however it is often timed said that they would not ship a AR (Advanced Replacement) on products worth a certain amount. Either way, Logitech has a good customer service, which is exploited, as they generally do AR's without any CC. Sometimes they do not even ask for it back. Still done.
-Microsoft Xbox's took a big hit before, back in december-January. They abused this through the site, so many people do tens to hundreds. Once the serial algo was figured out, it was all over, it became very widespread and many people got a lot of xboxes. It eventually became patched by Microsoft.

Their is plenty more that I won't mention, as theirs too many. But this is generally what I found from what research. Many of the top members keep the best ""methods"" private, to exploit for expensive products such as Macbook Pro's, Televisions, etc."	t5_2qlud	True

From a structural standpoint, the conflicts come from folks in different departments who have different goals when they need to work together.  

For example, we want our list price to be the price we sell our product at.  However, for bigger deals, or strategic deals, we have customers who want price breaks.  

The salespeople working on the deal are so focused on the immediate desire to ""win the deal"" that they are very willing to make concessions without asking for anything in return.  

From a structural standpoint, we have an executive team who has to approve any price breaks.

BUT, this has led to infighting, because the person who tries to hold the line on price then gets perceived as being responsible for losing sales.  

I've tried to make a couple of structural changes, and I'm curious to know if there's anything else I can do to ""engineer"" some improvements about how our company operates.

For example:
*I've constantly reminded the folks who are finding that we have a shared mission, we are on the same team, we need to work together.  i.e. let's keep the focus on making good business deals, both now and in the future
*I have suggested negotiation training for the sales team.  In our experience, we've found that folks who go to classes might come back all inspired, but unless there are organizational changes so that they actually use what they learned, they quickly go back to business as usual.
*To counter that, I have suggested that we have pre-negotiation planning meetings BEFORE final proposals are shown to a customer.  (At least, for the bigger deals.)  This way, we can strategize how to handle customer price objections.  And be able to come up with other areas that we could make concessions that don't have to do with price.
*There are also a few instances where we need to re-examine our price for certain products.

Any other ideas that we could try?

In most locations, people respected other peoples personal space.  AKA, if I don't know you, rubbing up against me isn't ok.  Or, if there is a line, leaving a decent gap between people is normal.  Nothing huge, but to the point that I could take a step back and I probably wont hit you.

However, I have recently moved to a place where it seems that it is socially normal for guys to rub up against other guys.  Note, guys wont  do this to girls, only guys.  And I don't really see it being an issue with girls on girls or girls on guys.

And it happens in situations where there really is no excuse.  For example, if I am in a buffet line, rubbing shoulders with me constantly isn't ok.  Wait your turn, the food isn't going anywhere.  Or, if you need to go from point A to point B, walk around me, don't hug as close as you can to me so you can get where your going faster.

I even had it happen at a job fair where I was wearing a really nice suit.  I was just standing somewhere and someone just rubbed up against my back and kept walking like that was no big deal.  I wanted to yell and scream at him (I'm wearing a nice suit, I don't want people rubbing up against it), but its a job fair so obviously it wouldn't go over well.  At the same event, I watched a person who was talking to at the job fair (a recruiter) get ran into extremely hard from behind.  And the person didn't apologize to the recruiter at all.

I understand that there are different cultures, but I really am not ok with this.  

Has anyone had an issue with this ever?  How did you get people to respect your personal space without coming off as anti-social or having to just individually tell them to back off (because the latter won't work if it is a cultural thing)?  

Maybe this isn't a big deal for some people, but people really don't get it around here.  Even simple body language that shows I'm agitated seems to just get puzzled responses.

Hi, Just wanted to drop you a line to let you know about a recent small victory in the no-SSN corner.

I recently tried to open a bank account with my local bank , and when they asked for a SSN, I informed them that I didn't have one. They flatly refused and said that without a SSN that they absolutely could NOT open an account of any kind. I then proceeded thus to convince them that they were in the wrong: 1) I informed them that I had terminated my SSN legally in accordance with 20 CFR 3 A7 404.1905 and 2) I informed them that the bank could not be held legally responsible by anyone for failing to obtain a SSN from me pursuant to 31 CFR 103.34(a)(1) and 3) I informed them that under the Internal Revenue Code Section 6041, that they were not even required to provide any taxpayer identification numbers on the Form 1099 that they file with the IRS at the end of the year, and 4) I informed them that pursuant to 26 CFR 301.6109-1(c) that they were under no legal obligation to obtain a SSN from me, and 5) I informed them that 42 USC 408 makes it a FELONY to use threat, duress, or coercion to try to force a person by fear or deceit to provide his SSN in an unlawful manner. After a brief meeting with the banks controller and legal counsel, I received a phone call stating that I would be allowed to open a checking account. Please pass this information along to your readers, in hopes that it may help someone else who may find themselves in this situation.

What I've noticed is that a lot of people seem to have no problem being openly and obnoxiously 'anti-gay'.

1376102913.0	1k2h4r	Advice?	hulone	17	10	9	"I have recently joined a new school. It's much bigger than my former one. All of my new teachers are far more strict in comparison to my former teachers, and my former teachers trusted me *a lot*. I wasn't sure where to post this, but I figure dealing with the problem will inevitably deal with talking and convincing people higher up on the totem pole than myself.. which is what I need help with. 


My main problems are
-One teacher in particular forbids her students from doing some of her ""pet peeves,"" one of which is any type of personal grooming (today she snapped at someone for merely looking at his reflection in his sunglasses..), because she considers it ""gross."" I think this is just petty. I don't think she has respect for us and obviously has not considered the psychology behind why people groom. She also has a 14 yr old son, so I think her parenting may play a role in how she treats us (like kids). 


She also requires everyone to keep a massive three ring, 3 in binder because there's ""a correlation between the binder and high scores"" (this is an AP subject). I suppose I am an exception, but I am the type of person who is highly unorganized and has made very high scores on any type of standardized test, including APs.. thusly I find it insulting that she's forcing this on me (binder will be graded on organization).


My problem is not in following these silly procedures, but in that I believe her lack of consideration and respect will affect an effective relationship between her and I throughout the year. **How do I bring this up early in the year, and without offending her?** 

-My other problem (and this is a general, all-teachers thing) is that I now get tardies for going to the bathroom. My classes are very spread apart (it's a massive campus), so I can't do it during the passing periods, or I'll get a tardy that way. Even if I did have to accept a tardy, the teachers all require you to both sign out of the class and carry a humiliating object to the bathroom as a 'pass' (think, 5 gal neon pink bucket, large picture frame of a pug, etc). 

At my other school I was treated like an adult and if I needed to go to the bathroom, I could walk out of the class silently whenever I needed to. I am not going to tolerate being treated like a first grader. **Should I talk to my teachers one on one about this? how would I do that appropriately? or should I talk to the counselors? Or should I just get a doctor's note saying I need to go whenever I need to go? **"	t5_2qlud	True

So heres me. In high school I read How to Win Friends and Influence People, and it got my teenage brian thinking. In college I would run social experiments at bars to see how many drinks I could get bought for me and such. It became a part time hobby for me, but really jumped of after school. Being in the military, I change posts every few years. Even while I'm at the same post, I switch jobs frequently. Every new job I get I have been recreating a new persona and using lessons learned from my old ones to futher myself. I have a whole stack of notebooks from all my experiments and results Ive gotten. I have never used any of this knowledge for anything illegal, but I have ventured into the unethical side. I've gotten senior officers quarters while deployeed, and its been years since ive paid for cable/internet. This whole time I had never really considered any of my tricks anything other than perfecting my social game, but there were time that I worried that I might be a socipath, or slightly crazy(reinventing myself, using trick 24/7 on my wife and kids). 

So recently I found reddit, which allowed me to stumble on here, which led me down the rabbit hole which is the science of social enginering. I've been wide eyed for the past week or so. I've found tons of tricks and angle that I never knew existed and am dying to find opportunities to start a whole bunch of new experiments.

My questions for the community(assuming what im talking about makes me fit, if not please redirect me) are:
Did most of you find the science and then start to practice it? or did you study it because you found yourself using it?
If I do not plan on using this professionally, just with personal interactions and for personal gain, what are some go to sources which can teach me the language and show me all the basics that I assume I'm missing?
Are there any underlying rules behind all of this? have I already broken them by engineering my family and friends?

Im popping my reddit cherry on this, but I figured this would be a great place to start. Thanks"	t5_2qlud	True

I have always thought about SE as a very broad definition of actions and taks geared towards behavior modification on a social level (instead of an individual level).  But then today I went to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering) and it lists that SE is *something* within 2 specific disciplines:

* Social engineering (political science), influencing society on a large scale

* Social engineering (security), obtaining confidential information by manipulating and/or deceiving people

To me is a lot broader, to include:

* Trial Lawyers (http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/zf9lo/are_the_best_trial_lawyers_actually_great_social/)

* Acting and Show-business in general, see George Clooney or Kim Kardasian

* Business: cigarette business for instance, or sodas, or expensive perfumes...

And then I was thinking that 

* Social Engineering

*Game Theory

* Behavioral Economics (e.g.: Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational)

* The Games People Play

Are all related, study of human behavior, of individual choices, and how to *influence* them (manipulation)

So, are companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon run by Social Manipulators?   I remember a while back reading about that Google in the early day hired some big name Game Theorist to help them put together their AdWords business, based on Auctions (auctions are part of Game Theory).

I haven't done much mechanic work and I pretty much spend my time doing garbages, recycling, sweeping, vacuuming, dealing with customers, and other miscellaneous tasks. So, up until this past Thursday my boss has, annoyingly, been complimenting how much better a job I do of the last two kids who worked there, how well my work ethic is, and over all just lots of compliments. Two weeks ago, he just handed me a twenty dollar bill and told me to go take my girlfriend out for a movie or something on him. Great guy, and the other staff are really cool too. But, on Thursday (and honestly this was foolish of him) he mentioned that there's this other kid he's looking to hire who has worked in a bike shop before and can do my job and work on bikes as well, which I cannot (at least not until I'm taught how to, which no one has taken the time to do so yet). So, I worked on Saturday, and it was really busy. I did do a couple things wrong, like almost let a kid under ten test ride a bike (company policy no one under ten to test ride bikes, I was unaware of this until then), I left a light unplugged, and I messed up when I was ringing up this one person's purchase. It was hectic to say the least, and I was getting pretty stressed out honestly, but I owned up to it and listened to my manager's suggestions and what not. So I get a text this morning about how I need to be spoken to about my performance and attitude. I have no clue where this is coming from, I barely ever do anything wrong, and up until now I've been praised as the ""golden employee."" If this is the wrong place to ask, anyone know where this situation would be more suitably placed? And if it belongs here, then am I being paranoid? My boss made it sound like I did *everything* wrong and he acted extremely annoyed about little things like the lights.

Edit: also, if I'm not being paranoid, then what tips and tricks can I use to turn the situation around? *Or* am I just actually doing a bad job. I would think that, but my attitude is definitely in check and I always try to do my work properly. I don't curse or even joke around with them, I just do what they ask and I make sure to do it well. They're the ones who fuck with me, and I just laugh with them and keep doing my work. I am respectful and polite. I just don't see what he's talking about.

1369465156.0	1f0pkw	It looks like a phishing scheme on the Reddit		81	78	14	"I came across an interesting thing today.  I was reading through r/ObscureSubreddits when I came across this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/obscuresubreddits/comments/1dfhpx/rfanons_the_first_subreddit_that_allows_anonymous/). The title reads, ""/r/Fanons - the first subreddit that allows anonymous posting"". That sounds interesting. So, I went [over there](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fanons) and checked it out.

The first thing I saw in the sidebar was this:

&gt;To post on this subreddit, you need the Chrome or the Greasemonkey extension.

That's kind of odd. Why would you need to install a browser extension? Out of curiosity, I took a look at the [Greasemonkey extension](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/159191). Keep in mind, I'm not a programmer or anything like that, I'm just an ordinary guy on the Internet. As I looked through this thing, I came across a redirection link. Apparently, what this script does is redirect the text of your post to [another website](http://anonymousbot.eu01.aws.af.cm/) which, in turn, posts it under the username ""anonymousbot"". It does this while leaving the poster the sense that it's all taking place on the Reddit. If I understand this script correctly, it is essentially phishing the input on the Reddit submission page. In and of itself, it seemed innocuous. Being an open minded guy, I visit the redirect site. There wasn't much there. Suspicious.

A few minutes later...

I get a system pop-up box on my computer. It's the authentication/login dialogue box. Someone is trying to log into my computer. I'm pretty sure it's coming from that website I just visited. r/Fanons only has one moderator (other than anonymousbot, which isn't a real person) and I bet he's the guy that's trying to hack into my computer. He goes by the username ""RageVsRage"".

A common post in the r/Fanons subreddit are announcements for new releases of the browser extension. I wouldn't be surprised if future releases expanded beyond Reddit forms and began getting data about your online banking or Amazon account. He's betting that you will trust him because he's a redditor and reddit is full of good people. He's hoping that redditors will install his exploit extension without question.

Be careful out there.

Also this is going to be a ~~little~~ really fucking long, but it has *vastly* changed the way I look at people so I would say it's worth it.

So recently I discovered the Myers Briggs personality typing system. Long story short, there are 16 different personality types. But there's a lot of systems that define personalities, so why is this one different? And how will it help me in my future endeavors? Well, because this one goes a bit deeper.

The base of the system was created by Carl Jung. He said look niggas. There's only a couple different ways that humans perceive and process information. 8 different ways to be exact. You either perceive information by (S)ensing or i(N)tuition. And you judge that information by either (T)hinking or (F)eeling. That's only four? Well each function (that's what they're called) is either (i)ntroverted or (e)xtroverted. And to assure that most of this is based on hard science, an MRI can determine when people are accessing a certain function.

Sorry about the random parentheses, it'll all (hopefully) make sense in just a moment.

Fast forward a couple of years. Meyers and Briggs put it all together and made personality profiles about it. 16 different ones. Basically, all types can use all of the above functions, but they each type prefers to use different functions and the preferred functions are much stronger and easily accessible (basically, when you are most relaxed you will probably be using your dominant function). 

Functional Stack:
So each type has four functions that they use regularly, One sensing function, one feeling function, one intuitive function, and one thinking function. But don't forget the i's and e's. The order either goes ieie or eiei (if the first function is extroverted, the second is introverted, yadda yadda yadda).

Ok, so the way they differentiate between the sixteen is with four different letters.

I vs E

Introverted vs Extroverted. This is commonly mistaken as gaining energy from being around people (extroverted) vs gaining energy from being alone (introverted). While true as a very general rule, this is not how it is determined. I means that the personality type leads with an introverted function and E means the opposite. That simple.

S vs N

Does the type prefer to perceive their information by Sensing or by iNtuition? Now above I said that each type has both. But one is preferred, and that is determined by how high it is in the functional stack.

T vs F

Thinking vs feeling, does the type prefer to make decisions based on a subjective value system? Or cold and impersonal logic.

P vs J

Perceiving vs Judging, is the type more at home perceiving the world or judging it? This is a little more of a grey area, but to give a little context, a perceiver will be more likely to be late to a meeting and a judger will be more likely to plan ahead and get there on time. If your type has an extroverted judging function (the dominant or ""higher up"" one) then you are a judger, and if your type has an introverted judging function then you are a perceiver.

Now let's look at the functions in a little more depth. And before we get started down the rabbit hole, know that extroverted functions determine how we deal with the external world, and introverted functions deal with how we *think*.

Sensing: External sensors (Se) take the world in via their natural senses, they are finely in tune with the external world as it is in *that very moment*. Internal sensors (Si) are all about the past. They'll remember how something smelled years ago, they'll remember details, and they also tend to get stuck in their ways as they get older. When you dig down and attempt to access how exactly you felt in a certain situation a long time ago, you are probably using Si.

Intuition: If sensing is being finely in tune with what exactly your body is feeding your brain then intuition is having your unconscious mind get first look- and then feeding you back select information based on that. So that's how it works, but let me tell you what it really does (because if you just describe what it does, it kinda sounds like bullshit magic). If Se sees what *is*, Ne (extroverted intuition) sees *what could be*. Ne dominant personalities see what things could be, and how to get them that way. An Ne abuser would look at a flawed system and immediately be generating ways to improve it. It is very broad, has little depth, and is quick. If someone you know is a very quick thinker, they might be an Ne user. Now Ni is a little bit different. Where Ne looks at something and expands upon it to find something better, Ni looks deeper, harder (much narrower ""vision"" though) and attempts to reduce complicated matters into a system that can be manipulated and exploited. Ne would look at a stick and say ""Hey! That stick could be a sword!"" whereas Ni would look at the stick, internalize the stick, and just *know* what would happen to the stick if force was applied to it. Ni absolutely dominates physics.

Remember that Sensing and Intuition are both perceiving functions, regardless of the i vs e thing. They describe how people take in info.

Thinking: Te is all about organizing the external world in a way that makes logical ""sense"". It expands upon the horizon creating possibilities (if I do this, what would happen?). Te is about what is possible (though to a lesser extent than Ne). Ti is about what *isn't* logical. Ti is an inner line of though that trims down possibilities until one, singular, right answer is found. If two people wanted to go for ice cream, a Te user wouldn't give a shit where as long as ice cream was acquired, and a Ti user would determine exactly which type of ice cream was desired before setting out.

Feeling: Fe is an awesome function. It allows you to be naturally in tune with the emotions of others, but it comes with one major downside. It desires cohesion in a group setting. They want everyone to be on the same page and generally avoid conflict. A dominant Fe user may do something unpleasant just to ""keep the peace"". Fi users operate on an internal value system. While Ti determines what is right/wrong by cold hard logic, Fi determines the same thing by using a subjective value system that can vary greatly from person to person. Fi is where your emotions come from (remember that everyone has Fi and can use it, although to varying degrees, hence the hyper emotional people and the cool-heads).

Now just for fun, let's look at my own personal type. I am an ENTP.

Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving. [ENTP Profile](http://personalityjunkie.com/entp/)

The reason I found this subreddit so interestingly named, is that ENTP's are described as natural social engineers and I just thought that was kind of interesting.

So basically browse the hell out of some mbti related sites (I prefer personality junkie), learn the types pretty well, learn their weaknesses, and learn to identify the types in the wild. Then learn which buttons to press to get what you want (it's really good fun)."	t5_2qlud	True

The issue I've found, though, is that there exist a number of short phrases available to most people that prove difficult to respond to. Most of them are used without any kind of context when an individual is against the ropes, and they often represent a necessary abstract divergence from one's stream of ideas to respond to. I'm talking about these:

* And?

* Nobody cares.

* Please shut up.

The issue with these is that they are purely Ad Hominem attacks. However, they can't be ignored because they immediately place the opponent in a position of social inferiority, falsely casting them as the irritating or groundless subordinate while the person using them enjoys a brief respite from having to defend their views and commands a sudden new respect from his peers. They can't be called out as ad hominems usually because they also generate an informal tone wherein terms such as 'ad hominem' will be met with ridicule.

Some tales talk about how money is spent to ensure that the same at least budget returns for the coming year, other stories talk about squandering money on things just because they have the money to spend before the 'deadline'.

What is a strategy to approach businesses with AFTER they have submitted their returns - i.e how to get into them at the start of their budgetary year rather than chase at the end?

My consulting firm just got hired for a rather large account. Since I screw off on reddit so much, my brain is still available to pick for knowledge, but my idea of a crowd sourced educational text on social engineering will have to be passed on. 

I've mentioned this in private to some people before, but the idea was originally for these books to ran by the community, because ideas are always changing, controversy happens, and there is always someone who can word things better than you can. 

The 3 books were to be as such in my original idea:

A blanket educational text, for beginners and those who aren't planning on practicing the techniques. Purely knowledge based. 

The second one would be intermediate, including small activities to try and and progressions through techniques. 

The advanced text would cover practical application to certain fields: security and law enforcement, sales, advertising, psychology, and it would include practical knowledge in the related fields that are controversial here, such as NLP, hypnosis, and such. The idea there is to explain the evidence for and against these techniques, (although they would be touched on in book one) and to illustrate and practice the technique. 


Since this is crowd sourced, and everyone has different ideas, I'll be damned if it ever ends up that way.

These actions work on their own; they don't seem to depend on any larger plan. It seems that sustained use of such tactics can bring about larger scale change. I think that for most people, these things are an intuitive and automatic part of behaviour, and not something they're consciously planning.

I remember a friend claiming that within human interaction there are little moments of hypnosis. These experiences match that description. Their effect requires a sort of consent because it's possible to not go along with them, but they have a tendency to pull one along.

Maybe I could say it's kind of like coming together with others in the present moment, and then everyone having a choice in where things go from there. Some will apply a particular force that tends to move it in some direction, while other may allow it to happen.

Has this been studied? What is a good source of useful information on this phenomenon in general and how to use it and resist it in particular? Is it related to NLP? I know language can be used kind of like this, with careful phrasing which tends to induce people in a particular direction. I'm more interested in the use of body language in particular.

How should I 1) maneuver around the low-level employee and 2) get the higher-level employee to help me out? I can imagine different strategies for a man or a woman.

*Customers can win a free £500 gift card by giving feedback

*I work on the shopfloor but also manage and make internet orders for customers


So far my approach has been to make some kind of connection with someone, and then kind of make it obvious to them why I'm giving the card after I help them.

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:

The night was cold and the road was icy, 4am on black friday morning with an hours drive to the nearest walmart.

Mostly going for the fun of it when we did arrive at 5:30 the game we were coming for was picked clean out of the promo price rack (borderlands 2 for $25). As we walked around a bit more i noticed that listed at the normal $60 were rows of borderlands 2 in the glass cases. 

I then had a realization, all the bar codes would be the same. All i had to do was get one from the glass case. A plan began to bubble up in my mind, as i cased the area the plan solidified. I would approach one of the sales persons that looked new or could be a temp and explain my plight of not being able to find a copy of the game i wanted and if they would be so kind as to get me one out of the glass case.

well it worked like a charm, it also worked for my friend and we returned home to system link borderlands 2 at a cabin 7 miles from the nearest power line. It was glorious.

EDIT: oh yea, DUH. how could i have done better, what other situations could i apply this to, and how would i improve my approach in said situations 

TL;DR depending on if employees are supposed to sell games from the glass case at promo price i may or may not have pulled off delicious hijinks.

When typing in an email address, it treats everyone in the beta as though they were in your address book, it gives you their full name and email address. There are quite a few possibilities with this, following is the first scenario that came to mind.

I have no idea if this 'feature' is to be included in the full version. However, it allows a very simple, yet very effective phishing attack. Since the beta has just began, and most students will not have logged in yet, one could send out a 'confirmation' email from a regular gmail account, ie. autoconfirm.universitymail@gmail.com. The email could claim to be required for 'linking their ID to their new gmail account'. Doing this under the guise of additional security would only help your cause. Request a return email, in a specified format, that contains their name, ID number, password, and maybe some useless information to make everything ok. An assurance at the bottom of the page that 'this is an automated system and no individual will see this information' would seal the deal.

I have emailed the university about this weakness. We'll see if they take any action. 

Knowing someone's name is the first step in gaining more information. Another variation would be to email them a spoofed facebook page offering integration of the two services. Or if you're not so interested in account information, you could simply use this feature to stalk someone.

A typical conversation goes along the lines of them PMing me to say hi, either they ask to see my profile or I offer it to them, and then a short conversation follows.

Any suggestions for sales/flirting principles I could follow to lure in more guys? How can I convince them to pay $2.50/min to talk to me rather than looking at the legions of free porn?

1316548443.0	klwwy	Have you ever been called an opportunist due to your Social Engineering? (Example included)	dejust	4	3	4	"Of course no one should actually notice that you are letting thing play out in a way that is to your favor. But I must admit I have been ""clumsy"" a few times (after all you don't get anywhere without making mistakes), and I have been called an opportunist.

They meant it in the meaning that I exploit other people for my own good. I don't like to think that's true. **If something is solely benefiting me, I don't do it.** I want at least one other party to benefit from the situation as well.

This still makes me an opportunist. **I often grasp an opportunity**, if I see that it is benefiting almost everyone around me. It's just that I've let it slip somehow, and then I've been called an opportunist like what I did was really disgusting.

I admit I'm a bit socially awkard sometimes. Have this **example** to illustrate my point:

I'm out with my class mates on a school trip in a nearby city to go to a museum. On the way back to the station (we are like 30 students marching through the city with the teacher ahead), a group of girls is lagging behind. They are a bit pissed because the teacher has such fast pace and they are tired. I decided to wait for them to slow down and walk with them, because I can symphathize with them and want to cheer them up.

We are lagging behind more and more, and arrive at the station like half an hour late (we had much of time in reserve though, so no problems with catching the train or anything). So how to explain this to the teacher? The group of girls was still kind of pissed and wanted to confront the teacher. I quite liked the teacher though and knew it wasn't necessarily all his fault. So my plan was to talk to him alone to make it clear that I was not pissed at him and just wanted to make sure the girls don't get lost behind.

I don't know why, but I asked the girls if it was okay if I told the teacher that I was helping them catch up to the group and so on. Which was not wrong but not right either, I didn't encourage them to slow down, but I also didn't urge them to go faster, because that would have been rude, I *did* offer them some water though, and offered to carry their bags (yeah, I'm like that).

After that the girl told me I was such an opportunist and so horrible. She probably thought that I wanted to be the teachers pet. Maybe this is because most people in my grade aren't as mature to regard the teachers as an equal human being but rather as ""people who tell you to do stuff"", but that's just an aside.

What is your experience, have you ever been called an opportunist?

I unfortunately appear to have been skipped over by the ""cool gene"" that a lot of adolescent black males have. BUT, I do have some characteristics that I am trying to use to my personal advantage.

(1) Excellent public speaking skills. My voice sounds great on a microphone and boy can I gave an impassioned speech. I am regularly asked to speak on behalf of just about any organization that I am involved with, mainly because I have a compelling ""story"" and a strong oratory voice to tell it with. And people seem to be amazed when they hear a black male not speaking in ebonics, it's definitely racist but it's won me many a crowd. I remember after one speech, in front of the state capital next to the governor, some lady came up to me and told me something along the lines of ""You have probably been told this before, but you have the ability to connect with people on a deep emotional basis"". I didn't know what the fuck she meant by that so I just smiled and thanked her.... 

(2) Good at interviews. My god can I bullshit during an interview. One lady literally started weeping after I was done speaking about how passionate I was about her organization.....I really just wanted their lavish stipend lol

(3) Good at writing. I am a good academic writer. Not brilliant, but good. And again, it's the unfortunate reality, but being a black male and a little intelligent seems to make me seem x10 more intelligent to some people. This is especially true for 50+ liberals. 

And that's about all. Any suggestions? Especially for possible careers lol.

I may have been too humble - said my skill level with C++ is 7, and Java around 5 simply because I haven't had much of a chance to use it. I currently go to college, and in any given programming project I finish the assignments long before everyone else, have never really had any need for a tutor, and have helped my friends with nearly every programming assignment. I couldn't answer a few questions because it was simply stuff that I hadn't run into.

I'm uploading examples of my code to GitHub (obviously not same username, this is a throwaway). I'd like to show my code. I'd also like to convey that I'm a really fast learner - for example, I decided to write a Bash script for an assignment, without having ever used Bash. I finished the script, including the extra credit option (which was pretty challenging), within an hour. My friends struggled to even get the base script without extra credit working.

I have a 3.92 GPA currently as a junior, and am doing very well this semester as well, and enjoy coding. I started working on my own game with the Unity engine, I could upload that as well. I also had more than 3 years work experience (as a manufacturing engineer) before transferring into my school, which isn't overly applicable but it still shows that I'm a reliable employee.

Source video [here](http://youtu.be/NcspFO7o7Js).

This con is great, I think, because it has such a niche target and very precise payoff. The marks here are dishonest LoL players who want to gain an unfair advantage who are also uneducated about how LoL keeps track of data, and don't want to pay for it. He promises no passwords, no surveys, no downloads and gives simple step by step instructions.

The lie is simple and believable, when you click through to his page. Since he's already funneled in people who are likely to believe him with his keywords and video title, won them over with his confidence building, why wouldn't they? It seems so simple. 

What he asks them to do is to start a new account with the link he gives you, containing a special referral number used for RIOT employees to test for bugs and crashes. At level 10, used to be 5, you gain ADMIN status and full access to yadda yadda yadda. 

The brilliance is mind blowing. You click the link, and it takes you to the legitimate LoL sign up page, with the referral number. Of course, once you get to level 10, nothing happens. 

As long as you get to level 5 (both are relatively easy to do) he will be happy. You see, when you refer someone to league of legends, and they reach level five, you get XP boosts (or something, I don't play League of Legends often.)

That's what makes this so great. He probably put 15 minutes of work into this, and I'm sure hundreds of people have helped him get boosts, never aware that all he gave them was his personal referral number.

This shows the importance (for pen-testers in this sub) in CHOOSING YOUR TARGET. This guy has it figured out. Hell, he probably has more the one video like this, over multiple accounts. Its kind of sad that he put all this work into a video game, to be honest. But its a great example of Social engineering, and nobody comes out harmed (no money lost, no physical harm, but some time wasted).

It also shows use of several of the [7 basic cons,](http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/zxbyz/the_seven_basic_cons_or_the_seven_main_principles/) the distraction principle (distracted by the music and the lack of common red flags like passwords or surveys), the deception principle (the outright lie about the link being used by employees) and the need and greed principle. Its great. That said, it could be better.

For example, if he used the herd principle by having positive comments and tons of likes (simple scripts could do this for you, with enough spoofed IPs). The social compliance principle could have been used by allowing them to sign up for a fake league group full of people who've used his method (it would have to be fake, and not full of past marks). He really ought to have used the Time Principle and created a sense of urgency, something along the lines of the link is only good for a week, and just delete and repost the video or something. This is just speculation on my part, but I am sure that he'd have thousands instead of hundreds and honestly, since he's put this much work into it at this point, why not put in the extra effort? Also, and it might be because of adblock, but if he doesn't have targeted ads on these pages, that's money lost, too.
