1pm - He fell on his back, so I softly blew into his direction and he got back onto his feet

Today: 
7am - Woke up and he wasn't where he was before, I was worried he'd left, but I found him on my desk. 

1pm - He stopped moving, and I got a bit scared. He started moving again after so I presume he was sleeping

4pm - He started trying to fly out of the window, but kept hitting the glass. 

Our little friendship seems to have come to an end. I put him on a little usb to micro sd adapter, and put that outside my window, he's flown off now.
