So, this story begins at Ultra Music Festival 2013 in Miami, Fl. If you are unfamiliar with Ultra then think of other big music festivals such as Lollapalooza and Coachella BUT Ultra has the stigma of ecstasy pill popppin’ tweakers attached to it like pot smoking hippies at Woodstock! So, everybody is rollin’ face and having a good ole’ time when some form of mini riot breaks out in the back fence line where I just happened to be. Cops everywhere and people are getting jammed up. Unsure of why the riot even broke out....I still get slammed on my neck and thrown into the back of the patty wagon. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. Due too poor police work or a lot of chaos the good ole’ “pat down” or frisk missed the 30 or so pills of Molly’s tucked into my sack and now I’m sweating bullets in the back of the wagon because I know the more thorough check at the jail house will have the pills turn up and I’m looking at some serious time. Then DING!! IDEA!!! I say to the other 15+ plus tweakers on the bus “Want some molly’s......for FREE!!!?” 

Of course, they think I'm lying but once I flipped my cuffed arms to the front of me and start handing them out like cars on Oprah the rest of the night was pretty epic! Simply said, it was the funnest(yeah) and easiest night in jail ever. Jail full of kids who don’t think they ever left the party and are literally rollin’ through the night. Scary but one hell of a night! 


TL;DR went to Ultra Music festival, a riot I had nothing to do with breaks out and i end up apprehended in the back of a patty wagon with a bunch of molly pills. Knowing I wont be lucky again a give them all away to my fellow prisoners and we all roll our way to freedom the next day. "	t5_2qh7l	True

The5thaccount	2251	565	183	"Ok so just as a little background, a student at an Australian university I know ordered a spore print from the U.S.Approx. 2 months ago. This arrived all good and fine, but today his received an envelope, addressed to him containing a nice, handmade-looking card with a double bass on the front (Not a music guy?).

Inside the card it reads: Dear ""X""
We are so proud of you living independently &amp; coping with the challenges of university. Good luck with your exams. Thinking of you.
Dad &amp; Mum xoxo.  
It looks like his mothers handwriting.

Here's the kicker, also inside the envelope is a 5ml (auto-retracting I believe) syringe, containing some kind of light blue liquid. While this kid is, the guys parents are definitely not into drugs, nor has the discussion ever really come up...  

So I was thinking, is some kind of 'bonus' spore syringe with the order that has been intercepted or what? The envelope has a return address from home, but appears to be covering another one (could be recycled idk) Because right now he has honestly no fucking clue what's going on. Please help.

&gt;Borax

Thanks very much to Borax for inviting and facilitating this discussion. I conduct human psychopharmacology research as a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A major focus of my research involves laboratory studies determining the behavioral and psychological effects of psychoactive drugs in humans, particularly novel or atypical drugs. This work has examined hallucinogens (psychedelics) including psilocybin (mushrooms), salvinorin A (Salvia divinorum), and dextromethorphan; stimulants including cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine, and caffeine; and sedatives including alcohol, GHB, and benzodiazepines. I published the first placebo-controlled trial of salvinorin A to demonstrate psychoactive effects in humans. My current research with psilocybin is examining its potential for facilitating behavior change including therapeutic effects. These studies include a trial determining the ability of psilocybin to increase engagement in a meditation program, a trial testing if psilocybin can decrease anxiety and depression in cancer patients, and a pilot study examining psilocybin as an anti-addiction medication for tobacco smoking cessation.

In addition to my laboratory work, I’m currently conducting a survey to characterize use patterns, drug effects, and health risks associated with “bath salts” products. Similar surveys have been conducted in Europe, but this is the first to focus exclusively on the United States. If you have used a “bath salt” product previously and live in the U.S., I would very much appreciate you taking 25-30 minutes of your time to complete the survey, which can be found [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JHUBathSaltSurvey). My hope is that these data will provide a glimpse into the expanding “legal high” marketplace. Please note the survey is not designed to assess use of known, single-entity cathinone derivatives, but rather use of “bath salt” products without knowledge of contents (e.g., labeled as “bath salt,” “plant food,” “glass cleaner,” etc.).

Shameless plug aside, I’d be happy to answer any questions regarding my work with any of these drugs. I’d also appreciate any comments or feedback you have for me with respect to the “bath salt” survey. Thanks again for the opportunity!


Edit: Thanks to Borax and to everybody that has asked questions! This has been a lot of fun. I was really impressed by many of the thoughtful questions asked.  I typed as fast as I can and I'm sorry I couldn't get to all the questions posted. But now I have to move on to some other work.  For those that I could not answer directly, I'm hoping my answers to others' questions were helpful and of interest.  Thanks again!  -Matt"	t5_2qh7l	True

September to meet their goal. Can we help them out?"	NI3	1306	194	120	"http://www.erowid.org/donations/sept_drive.php?src=818

&gt; Help keep Erowid going strong (and make this our best month of support ever) by becoming one of 818 people to contribute in September. We have 17 years of success in bringing together physicians, lawyers, and people of all ages to build this quality collection of information. Support Erowid's mission to provide a reliable resource about psychoactive drugs by making a small donation!

I know that most, if not all of us, have used Erowid and they have helped keep us safe, and maybe even keep our lives/ sanity. Now is better than ever to donate, any amount even, for us to show our support of this tremendously helpful resource. And as an added bonus, certain donation sizes get you sweet hoodies and tees. Some of them are even low key enough to be worn in public without fear.

Edit: Erowid now needs only 179 donations, that means Reddit potentially added 66 donations, today alone. Good work guys, we're getting there.

Edit 2: Only 72 more donations needed to meet their goal. C'mon guys, we can do it!"	t5_2qh7l	True

This is merely my interpretation of the effects of the drug as informed by my beliefs and experiences; your mileage may vary.

So, you've taken MDMA. Everything in the world is imbued with this phantom significance; you feel utterly intimate with all of your preexisting relations, and totally at ease around and appreciative of strangers is well. Music takes on an earth-shattering, ethereal quality. Sex becomes a unified poetry of coalescing bodies, ""a genital fire, transformed by delight.""

Then, the comedown. You feel the rosiness slowly wash away, giving way to the comparatively grayscale hues of everyday reality. Some choose to further fan the flames with a redose; most allow the melancholia of sobriety to encroach upon their glow; I propose a different route.

To be fully satisfied with a roll, I find it necessary to truly recognize that feeling for what it is: not a fantastical euphoria coming from and fading into nothing, but a chemical amplification of what is already there. Your friendships and intimacies really *are* that beautiful, the drug is just directing your inattentive mind toward those really important things that tend to get lost in the day-to-day haze of monotony.

There is nothing new here. Only the is-ness of relations and objects that we tend to gloss over when not living deliberately. There is nothing new to the music other than your perception of it, and similarly nothing alien in that feeling of empathy other than your increased willingness to recognize (and vocalize) its existence.

So don't get down when the drug has left your system. Probe your mind for what it is that made you feel that way and cherish it. Don't let those hidden epiphanies get buried. Use MDMA as a glorious reminder of existence of beauty and love in our every day lives, not a brief respite from a cold and uncaring world.

edit: I'd like to clarify that I'm not trying to imply that bad feelings after/in-between MDMA doses are completely in your control, but that there is a psychological aspect there which you can manipulate. I just wanted to elucidate the fact that MDMA feelgood isn't purely a chemical experience, but a chemically-induced shift of perspective which focuses your attention on the best things in life -- a shift which can be referred to later to enrich your sober life."	t5_2qh7l	True

The pipe trembles between my fingers and drops to the floor with a tink, rolling away from my feet as my eyes pull back into my head. Thoughts bounce around the inside of my skull at a madman’s pace. “You alright, man?” I hear somebody whisper behind me. They might as well be worlds away. Cut me, I won’t bleed. Beat me, I won’t bruise. For just a minute or two, I am God.
And just like that, a cold snap of clarity whips across my consciousness and brings me back to the world of the living. My vision has not yet adjusted to the darkness of the room. A feeling of emptiness swallows me whole. “I..I want another.” Laughter echoes off the grimy stucco walls. “You’ll get another. Wait your turn, friend.” I am standing, opening the door, walking out of the room, but my body remains in that chair. A shell of myself will always be in that chair. As I passed through the doorway and was assaulted by the bright light of a California afternoon, my friends greeted a ghost and escorted him to their car. “How was it man? Is it is crazy as they say? Are you going to try it again? You’re wild dude!” I just stare off into the distance, and think about the sound that pipe made when it hit the ground. Tink. I wish I could go back there and pick it up.

The ramblings of a paramedic.	fischestix	1280	316	539	"I get sick and tired of the misinformation about drugs in this country and society in general.  Dishonest drug education is insulting and damaging.  Without sounding  preachy or judgmental I have compiled a list of how dangerous I think certain drugs actually are.  These are in rough order from most to least scary to me.  I will only comment on substances I have come in direct contact with as a medical provider.  I will not discuss case or patient specifics.  **I will disclaim this by saying this is my personal opinion based on my experiences, and not meant to endorse or recommend consuming any drugs.  Any time you put any substance into your body you risk death**, these risks increase significantly when you rely on a product that has to be sold on the black market... I digress....  

 **Combinations**  Ask any overdosed dead celebrity..... combos kill.  By far the number one thing I see in drug related emergencies is combinations.  Mixing substances can have unexpected and powerful effects.   

**PCP** is the drug that frightens me personally the most.  I have fought normal sized humans that easily took on 5 people and a taser with out slowing down.  I don't know what habitual users look like or the down sides of long term use because I have never treated the same PCP patient twice.  The people who are on it do not look to be enjoying themselves.  I have never seen anyone as violent as a person on PCP.  I have no idea what percentage of users react this way.  

**Bath salts** People on bath salts behave similarly to people on speed but with a bit of the disorientation and violence of PCP.  Users have often picked their skin off or have scratched themselves raw.  The neglect and decline in physical health reminds of of methamphetamine.   I have seen this drug cause serious heart  arrhythmias and neurological deficits that I believe to be permanent.  

**Huffing/Inhalants** (edit)  I forgot about this because I consider more like auto erotic than a drug  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;.  You are using a chemical that replaces oxygen in your blood.  This is obviously not good.  I have seen people with brain damage so severe they are in a nursing home from huffing.  Huffing is getting high on a mild to severe head injury.  Long term huffers and old traumatic brain injury patients are indistinguishable.  

**Methamphetamines**  The effects of heavy meth use are exactly as bad as shown in the media.  This drug literally breaks your body down.  I can't say enough negative about this drug.  The things it does to the human body and mind are just sad. 

**Cocaine**  The only contact I have had with cocaine is when someone has a major heart problem, often after years of use.  I have no idea on numbers or habituation, users of cocaine seem to downplay their use more than other drugs.  I rarely get a full usage history of a cocaine user.  I can say in some cases it can cause you to have a major heart attack and die, that's about the extent of my experience. 

**Benzodiazepines**  (edit) Basically the opiate's slow cousin (as far as how people present).  Symptoms can mimic heroin overdoses but are more difficult to reverse.  The reversal agent isn't carried by many ambulances because of the side effects of treating benzo overdoses with out doing lab work first.  I almost always see benzos combined with other drugs, which is when they are a serious threat.  People on a benzo/opiate mix are far more prone to sudden cardiopulmonary collapse than the opiate by its self.  

**Opiates** are opiates....  I make no distinction between Rx pills and street heroin as far as the addition is concerned.  The delivery method, purity/concentration and tolerance the variables.  People whom I have revived from respiratory arrest due to narcotics overdoses are always mad.  Apparently this is the best feeling in the world, ""being so happy you die"".  Everyone knows opiates are very addictive.  They have the potential to cause many negative health effects when abused.  That said I was on high dose opiates for months (prescribed) and successfully weaned off of them even though I enjoyed them thoroughly.  I have no idea how much the deaths from ODs would drop if people knew the concentration of what they were using, at least some.  Also, reversing heroine overdoses is easy.  A simple nasal spray or injection of a relatively harmless drug totally reverses opiate overdoses.

**Acid/LSD/Shrooms** I call these the non-violent hallucinogens.  The effects of LSD, acid or shrooms on people seem to have a lot to do with their frame of mind.  I basically see peoples existing issues turned into a freak out.  The other people (the not sick ones in the room) seemed to be having a decent time.  I have never had anyone totally in a different world who was on just acid (hard to test for, based on admissions).  Several users of acid have described it as seeing the world that is actually there, just distorted.  Sometimes people on shrooms have gastric problems like vomiting.  I imagine that's less than fun while on a hallucinogen.  I have never seen any major changes in vital signs that I couldn't attribute to anxiety.  

**Alcohol**  By far the most wide spread drug I encounter.  If it's after midnight at a car wreck and I don't have a drunk person, I'm missing a patient.  Long term there are negative effects on the body and short term it can alter peoples' moods for the worse.  

**Marijuana**  In almost 15 years I have only twice taken care of a person who's only medical problem was cannabis consumption.  Both cases were panic attacks.   I have had people injure themselves while high, in a similar ways to alcohol just less often.  I have also never treated anyone with long term health effects of using only marijuana, although people with long term health effects from drugs rarely use one.  Since I rarely encounter users in a medical capacity it's hard for me to say what other issues it may cause.  My impression is that this drug may be far less harmful than it is made out to be, similar if not less problematic than alcohol in my opinion.

**tldr; A breakdown of how scary different drugs are perceived to be by a paramedic.**

If someone has an idea for me to verify my credentials w/o revealing my identity let me know.  I will answer any questions to the best of my ability.

-edit-Format/line breaks, added benzos

-edit- No, I myself do not consume drugs other than alcohol socially and the above mentioned time I was prescribed narcotics.

Follow up to common PMs-- 

What do I think about legality of drugs?  My personal opinion on drug prohibition is that it causes more death and suffering than it alleviates.  I believe in personal accountability.  People are to blame for tragedy, not the implements they use...be that cars, guns, drugs, knives etc.

Where did I work?  I have worked 8 years in a high volume urban setting and just over 6 in suburban/rural 911 based EMS.

How often are calls drug related?  If you count people exaggerating or fabricating symptoms to get drugs, drug/alcohol related or exacerbated issues made up as much as half of my 911 calls in the urban environments.  It is less than one in ten in the rural and it's maybe one in five in the suburban.  That would jump greatly if you excluded people under 12 and over 70.  

Do I tell the police when someone is on drugs?  Not unless I absolutly have to for legal or safety reasons (children present etc).  If the police are around what you say is up to you.  When they are gone I'll ask again so that my treatment doesn't accidentally kill you based on the drug you won't admit you took.  

What do I do with drugs I find on a person?  I turn them over to the next authority I see next.  That could be hospital security, a doctor or a police officer on scene.  Usually they are simply destroyed.  We *try* not to punish people for calling 911 for a medical emergency."	t5_2qh7l	True

1373549846.0	1i2ueo	An ode to shitting on drugs	Quintillius	1238	269	255	"Whether you are taking a nice long shit in the comfort of your own home. While the walls are melting in fractal patterns, or frantically trying to exorcise that foodbaby that has lodged itself in your colon, on a festival port-a-potty, while peaking on MDMA, shitting while on drugs is always an unique experience. 

You are alone with nothing but a large clump of excrement exiting your backdoor, eyes as dilated as your anal sphincter, and a small cubicle that is to be the theatre of war for the battle that is about to commence.

Your thoughts are racing already, for good or bad, for in this moment you are truly alone. You might be able to hear the distant thumping of bass, or the poop grunts of adjacent toilet-goers, but they are far away, unable to reach you in your now smelly sanctuary.

Your pants are down around your ankles, usually you would take some care to make sure they dont come into contact with the brown water soaked floor, but at this moment, you do not care. You look up at the door in front of you, it is decorated by the memoires of the faceless hundreds who have pooped here before you. Some are funny, some are smart, most are stupid. If you are tripping, you find yourself unable to decipher whether they are incomprehensible because they are written in the hip-hop-esque calligraphy that so often adorns any surface bereft of constant adult supervision, or because the letters are dancing around in a slow breathing waltz, unable to find their anchorhold in reality.

You gasp.

It has begun.

Far tougher than you had imagined, the first push brings with it a light sweat on your forehead, a heat inside your body, and a focus point. Your attention has planted it's foot squarely on the task ahead, the thoughts that were previously storm-like in nature, brushing sides with every conceivable topic: The girl, the friends, the night ahead and the night passed by, your life, maybe even your death, have now found a point of focus.

""This is it"" you hear yourself thinking, you heave, every muscle is tense, but you cannot keep going like this. As you relax, a nice short log plops into the toilet below you.

The second wave is harder, but you are ready for it, brace for the G's, fast hold-release work. The eruption is muffled by the intense feeling in your body, as an avalanche of brown matter shoots out of your anus, sputtering onto the sides of the bowl, but luckily missing your exposed and clenched buttocks.

You realize you have been holding your breath, and relax, taking a few well earned huffs of air.

That was the hard part, now, your leisurely push out the last pieces of resistance, each plop brings with it a short surge of ecstacy. 

You are almost drenched in sweat, you take your time to wipe, maybe you even sit for a while and contemplate. When you are ready, you pull up your pants and walk out the door, a hero.

This law has already killed most drug-related Russian sites (except maybe bluelight.**ru**), today it took erowid. It is obviously still accessible through Tor, but the fact that our government tries to block people off *any* info on drugs is really sad. 

Anti-drug mentality is already very strong among Russians (see [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6cLf4TuzrY) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=civQZXOlmGQ) - an organized group of people finds spice and marijuana dealers, then publicly beats/humiliates them or vandalizes random property. Passer-bys say stuff like ""these dealers should be executed"", and their yellow posters say ""I sell death"" or ""I kill your children"", that are not exactly true).

Anyways, I just wanted to let off some steam and see what you think of it, maybe your country has it's own drug-censorship laws, and maybe even ""radical anti-drug organizations"" like in those videos.

**For Russians who can still access erowid.org**: use it while you can, because it is listed on zapret-info.gov.ru, so you will most likely lose access in a week or two. 

**As advised by GratefulListener, [here](http://de1.erowid.org/erowid_archives/) you can download a snapshot of erowid that you can use later from your computer. So, DO IT!**"	t5_2qh7l	True

Well honey, before you start fooling with me, just let me inform you of how it will be.

For I will seduce you and make you my slave, I've sent men much stronger than you to their graves. You think you could never become a disgrace, and end up addicted to Poppy seed waste.

So you'll start inhaling me one afternoon, you'll take me into your arms very soon. And once I've entered deep down in your veins, The craving will nearly drive you insane.

You'll swindle your mother and just for a buck. You'll turn into something vile and corrupt. You'll mug and you'll steal for my narcotic charm, and feel contentment when I'm in your arms.

The day, when you realize the monster you've grown, you'll solemnly swear to leave me alone. If you think you've got that mystical knack, then sweetie, just try getting me off your back.

The vomit, the cramps, your gut tied in knots. The jangling nerves screaming for one more shot. The hot chills and cold sweats, withdrawal pains, can only be saved by my little white grains.

There's no other way, and there's no need to look, for deep down inside you know you are hooked. You'll desperately run to the pushers and then, you'll welcome me back to your arms once again.

And you will return just as I foretold! I know that you'll give me your body and soul. You'll give up your morals, your conscience, your heart. And you will be mine until, ""Death Do Us Part""""

I miss the feeling of invincibility, of the confidence that I so rarely feel naturally. I miss looking back up at myself in the mirror after doing a line off my phone and thinking damn girl, you’re fucking hot.

I miss MDMA. I miss the sheer and utter bliss of rolling, rolling so hard that my eyes are even rolling, swerving backwards into their sockets. I miss being so receptive to others. I miss the feeling of loving even the people I hate, just for a night.

I miss LSD. I miss opening up to the sheer beauty of the things around me. I miss the colors radiating light, the light radiating colors. I miss being able to see in the physical world the patterns of my mind. I miss tripping, I miss seeing the visual manifestations of my internal thoughts.

I miss Adderall. I miss that brutal, gripping euphoria tingling throughout my entire body as I completed mundane everyday tasks. I miss doing Calculus in a tweaked out mania and thinking god, this is almost as good as sex. I miss becoming a feverish and frenzied Beast of Jazz, playing for multiple hours straight, playing till my fingers were raw as a butcher’s product.

I miss That One Night I Did Ketamine At A Rave, where I was unrecognizable with my eyes streaked like Cleopatra. I miss that WOBBLE WOBBLE WOBBLE each time when I stood up. I miss the feeling like I was hearing everything as if I were underwater, comfortably numb. I miss that odd, unfamiliar feeling when I looked in the mirror, as if I were looking at a stranger for the first time on the street, as if I were looking at myself objectively for the first time in my life.

I turned 18 last week, and I have had to put these substances, these little slices of magic, aside for the time being. Aside until I get a little better, until my anxiety stops being so bad that I can't make a simple phone call without shaking. Aside until I implement true discipline, until I am practicing my instrument every day... I’m about to go to a very expensive school in August. It’s my dream school and my parents are sacrificing a lot by helping me pay for it so I can’t fuck it up. 

I have never had an addiction, and drugs have taught me many things. Most of which are beautiful feelings and wonderful perspectives. Most of all, they taught me the importance of self-control and moderation. But if anything, drugs have fucked up my reward system a little bit. Caught up in the magic of drugs, it is easy to forget one's purpose. Why practice tedious scales when you can get high?

But there's more to it than that. Now I finally understand that the only thing that will save me personally at this point is music, is pursuing that seemingly impossible dream.

That’s the only dragon I chase.

Yesterday, some friends and I went to a Zedd concert. We had a hard time coming by some molly since we were calling people pretty late, only a few hours before the concert. It got to the point where two of my good friends said ""we're not going if we can't get molly, no point at all"". Obviously I was like wtf, but at the end we were able to make a few more calls and get some. Take note of the mindset though. 

Now, we were pregaming at a friend's house, some of us were just drinking a bit, while others were knocking back pills, and I got convinced to take some molly although I have an exam 2 days later. It's fine, no worries, haha. Anyway, so everyone does the substance of choice that night, then we go out. I don't feel anything at all during the concert, no unnatural euphoria or teeth grinding (we believe it's because I'm regularly on concerta for ADD and how concerta increases dopamine levels while inhibiting reuptake). IE. I was not rolling at all. But that's the difference, while at the concert, I was not waiting on getting up, I was already having fun, jamming to the music, dancing like I don't care. The rest of the fellas, after taking the molly but only feeling a bit, were standing still for most of the time, waiting for the molly to kick in -- as if the concert was a lecture or some shit and once the molly hit, it would turn into some godly heaven of music. 

I ended up having a blast. One of my friends left before Zedd even came out. It was all about mindset. I went in to have fun from the beginning no matter what. Even before it got crowded and the hype grew, I was dancing with everyone. 

I did not depend on anyone or anything to create my fun. I believe that was the biggest difference. "	t5_2qh7l	True

Walk through parking lots, across medians  
Walked as the crow flies  
Fuck the police  
""If we walk on the sidewalk we are no different than the animals in the cages we are about to go see""  
Probably the most stereotypically dumb sounding quote you would expect from someone who ingested LSD several hours ago to be saying  
But our thoughts nonetheless  
Walk through collegeliberalhippy neighborhoods  
See sign saying ""BEWARE OF GUARD FROG""  
Yes, it actually said that, we weren't just on acid, we checked  
Should have taken this as a literal warning sign that shit was about to get weird  
Pass through what looked suspiciously like the generic wallpaper that comes with windows XP  
Arrive at zoo  
Make stupid comments about how there is another species on display at the zoo that is walking all over the place (humans)  
Stressful navigating through the herds of families  
Notice the flocking algorithms utilized by the family units moving about  
See animals and shit  
They look like alien creatures walking on a foreign planet  
Thought the flamingos were plastic lawn ornaments till I saw one move its head  
Watching buffalo  
Looking in amazement at its enormous, oversized frame and raw biological power  
It suddenly begins shitting hilariously  
I bust out laughing which causes a bunch of little children around me to start giggling  
Feel I've crossed everything off on my zoo todo list  
We begin heading out  
Annoyed because stuck behind slow moving ghettoswagwhiteboiwithshinyearings and his unattractive girlfriend  
You can have swag, just don't fucking impede on my desired relative velocity to you  
Finally get out of zoo  
See old lady being helped up a curb by family members  
Oh wait, they're not helping her up the curb  
That old lady is clutching her heart and falling over and maybe dying possibly I don't know what is going on  
Fat guido looking woman holding the old lady screams something to family  
Family along with everyone else just keep looking at old lady gape mouth'd  
Several people call out ""someone call 911""  
I promptly decide to veto experiencing this situation anymore and walk away  
Made my way through the crowd in my very tasteful, inconspicuous wolf shirt/obnoxiously colored $5 sunglasses attire  
Takes a good 30+ seconds for anyone to noticibly call 911  
Feel like I'm in a psychology textbook's hypothetical situation illustrating the bystander effect  
Get bizarre acid image of myself as Michael Corleone walking away from the scene of the murder in the Godfather  
Feel guilty over not being able to help because we were dumb and on acid  
Rough road of thought to travel down when lost in the forest of LSD  
Branch this line of thought and start a new path  
Try to piece together with J what happened  
""We saw the circle of life""  
""Funny thing, we are going to be walking by the exact hospital I was born in up here""  
Walk by J's actual birthplace  
Hospital looks completely empty and abandoned for no apparent reason  
Maybe there weren't many sick people today  
Walk to the lake in the finally beautiful spring weather  
Enjoy the fucking shit out of the cool ass breeze and nature shit going on around here  
Sit on rocks by small ragged docks  
Watch waves on lake  
Think of how often the abstract concept of wave shows up  
Water waves  
Sound waves  
Radio waves  
Even though we consist of particles, they too have a wave-like nature  
We are just waves knocking up against each other in the 4 dimensional ocean we call the universe  
But within, we find other, simpler examples of waves, like the ones traversing the 2D plane of water in front of me  
Waves, circles, life cycles, everything seems to be tying together today, almost uncomfortably so  
""WTF though did we actually see an old lady die though seriously wtf""  
Continually frustrated/slightly frightened while attempting to integrate the experience of watching someone die into my own memory, into my own experience  
J's not very phased by any of this though  
We watch in awe as an enormous fish undulates through the water in front of us  
J says this moment is the most memorable of the day  
J says some zen like things about appreciating small individual experiences and living in the moment  
We chat about dumb life stuff on walk home  
We have a maximum number of fucks we can give each day  
Our job is just to distribute them as optimally as we can  
But give a fuck about your family, visit them and talk with them

I learned of a term that I had never heard before called ""dusting"".  People who were members of ""the family"" supposedly used powder / crystal LSD and blew it into people's faces as a form of punishment when they fucked one of their own over, as in botched drug deals, etc.  I had never heard the term ""dusting"" before today, but I have a story about using LSD in this way.

I just want to point something out before everyone reads this.  I never really felt 100% comfortable with the story that you are about to read.  I never had contemplated using LSD in this manor before.  My WHOLE goal in life was to spread the beauty of LSD when I was younger.  I wanted everyone to have the kinds of beautiful and mind melting experiences that I had; I never wanted to hurt anyone.  The actions in the following story were not pre-meditated.  With that, here you go.

A friend and I were selling liquid L at a rave somewhere between 1997-98. We never worried about a THING when carrying around $3000 in cash in our pockets at these events. Bringing in 10 vials was never even thought of as dangerous or risky thing to do.  I mean, we had to have police pat downs at the entrance, but they saw us EVERY single weekend at this one location and the police knew us.  Unless you had something obviously sticking out for them to feel, they normally just did a light pat down for weapons on the regulars.  People DID get caught with vials and big bags of E at the door every weekend though; they were just put into the back of a cop car, they took the drugs, and let them go and told them to never come back. The police even made walks-throughs during the parties about once an hour, but as long as they didn't see you making deals they didn't bother you. As far as people getting jacked for drugs / money, it just wasn't going on in those days.

One night my friend had just finished selling a vial for me and he met me in the back of the drum n bass room to count out my money and receive another vial. All of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw these 4 GIANT Samoan guys that I had seen once before. These were some of the largest human beings I have ever seen in my life. They were all 350-400+ lbs and they were all over 6'6"" and taller. Their arms were the size of my legs. Their hands were as big as dinner plates. No joke.

The reason why I had seen these guys before was because I ran a night club. One month prior to this experience, these 4 guys showed up at my club at 3am in the morning. We were just about to close down and there were only about 8 people left in the club. About 3 minutes into them being there they found what I to this day assume was the one guy in the club who had E pills on him. They picked him up and threw him into the girls bathroom and beat the ever living fuck out of this guy and stole his stash. He was beaten so badly we had to call paramedics. His face was turned into a pumpkin and his ribs were broken.  The guy said he didn't want to press charges when the police came; this is what led me to believe it was a drug deal gone horribly wrong. So this is where I had seen these guys before. ...now back to the rave.

So as we are counting this money in the back of the drum n bass room, I catch a glimpse of those very same guys AND they were looking RIGHT AT the money we were exchanging. Right as I saw them I told my friend to put the money in his pocket and run. JUST as I finished saying that, those dinner plate sized hands flew in between us reaching for the hundreds of dollars. I jumped backwards as 3 of the samoans proceeded to pummel my friends face into the ground. His shoe even came flying off, that's how hard he was getting beat! The other guy who was with them was holding me back making sure I didn't interfere with what was going on, not that I could have if I wanted to. I stood there in SHOCK while I watched my friend take the most relentless beating of his life. I had to go get help.

I ran around the party to get a mob of friends together; I needed numbers to help out. By the time I got back around to the dnb room about 3 minutes later they were gone. I had 15 people in tow behind me and found my friend standing there (luckily) with that signature pumpkin head I had seen before. His face was bleeding profusely and his shirt was ripped half way off his body. Out of nowhere I realized that I had a weapon on me. I had something that had the power to teach a ""lesson"".  I wanted these guys to know that attacking and robbing people in our scene was the last thing they should be doing (let alone in ANY scene, or to anyBODY).  I had vials of acid. I decided the best way to handle this situation... I was going to teach someone a lesson with LSD...

I unscrewed a cap off one of the bottles, bit down on the top of the dropper and sucked the LSD that was in / on it while I went looking for the thugs who just destroyed my friend with a giant mob behind me. We found them in the middle of the main floor of the rave. It was hot, sweaty, and stanky in there. There were fog machines blowing and vision was minimal. I walked up to the guy who initiated the robbery attempt / beating and I tapped on his right shoulder from behind. As he turned around I took that bottle of L with the dropper removed and splashed it into his eyes and took off running....

To this day I don't know what ever happened to those guys. I do know that they ended up leaving about 5 minutes after that. I can only imagine what kind of a dose that thuggalo took to his eyes / nose / mouth. I was selling some VERY strong Silver at the time and 3 hits of the stuff was extremely mind melting.

The one thing I do know for sure is..... those guys NEVER came back  to any electronic music event from that day on. I know this for sure because I was throwing those events and attending every single one of them during those years.

I think those guys learned an important lesson that night. At least one of them did...

1368391829.0	1e7asr	PSA: On Reddit's increasing fondness for psychedelic compounds - particularly Psilocybin and Diemethyltryptamine.	forgotpasswordagain0	989	193	253	"I've been seeing many questions and posts about psychedelic drug research and use on a number of different subreddits - which I'll call multidisciplinary interest, if you will -  and almost all of it is positive. There is talk and promulgation of studies regarding psychotherapy with the assistance of compounds like MDMA and LSD. A popular frontpage post was an article highlighting recent research that found psychedelic drug use is still prelevant and popular, now rising in popularity, in America and the world over.

Many people on reddit are coming forward with their trips, their experiences, their words of advice and their knowledge. And all of this is great. It's excellent that we can all group together like this. 

However - I'm seeing a lack of realistic warnings. Nobody wants to be ""the buzzkill"", but - for example - a decision to use such drugs based purely on the knowledege *of* them, and not knowledge *about* them can lead to potentially disastrous outcomes. I hate to shatter any illusions here, but as many of you already know, shrooms, DMT, mescaline, LSD, Phenethylamines - these drugs are not always a direct line into your spirit leading to a beautiful experience every single time.

There is a popular idea that a ""bad trip"" is where someone freaks out and loses their shit, with nasty hallucinations and irrational acting. This is almost never the case. A much more common type of ""bad trip"" that any seasoned user can attest to is a lot more subtle and sinister - unfathomable depression that lasts the entirety of the drug's effect on you. There are no dead rotting animals climbing out of the ground, no explosions in the sky all around you, no horrible screaming - usually there's just you looking into yourself introspectively and literally not having the capacity to see any shred of self worth or confidence in yourself. For many, for anyone - myself included -  the ""mind opening"" experience of our role in the universe can be terrifying and scarring. For the euphoria that these compounds can bring you, for the spiritual openness and connectivity with the world, they can do the exact opposite too. This is what nobody seems to want to talk about. 

TL;DR - Psychedelics are one of life's mysterious treasures, but they *do* **have an extreme potential to cause harm. Please research any chemical before you take it and always keep an eye on your environment and mood.**"	t5_2qh7l	True
1361848267.0	198i4a	"Over a decade of enthusiastic substance use and abuse, I thought I’d share some of the things I’ve learned.
"	drinkbot	971	170	238	"Instead of trolling the Melatonin thread anymore, I thought I'd share my own thoughts on the various substances I've played around with over the years.


**RCs**: I’ve been lucky and only had one real bad experience, 5-Meo-DMT. It felt like dying. It was the first time in years that I prayed. I thought I’d finally gone too far. Turns out, that was just the death experience spoken of by Leary and others. I had read a great deal about all the different types of experiences psychedelics could bring, but nothing could have prepared me for the existential terror I felt. Oh, and it was humiliating to realize that I was only an atheist as long as I didn’t think I was dying.

In retrospect, taking RCs is reckless. You don’t know what you’re getting, and even if it is pure, if something goes wrong, there’s very little help a doctor could give you.


**Psychedelics**: Shrooms, Acid, and Ayahuasca can be an amazing journey into a mystical realm, a year’s worth of therapy, or they can land you in a nightmare of your own creation. I always tell people the same thing. If you can’t sit still and meditate for 10 minutes, you’re not comfortable enough with yourself to go mucking about in your psyche. The greatest moments of bliss in my life have been on psychedelics and in the sack.


**Uppers**: Having a boost of energy and confidence is great. But overconfidence can land you into serious trouble. No matter how great you feel, you’ll still have to live with yourself the next day when you’re not feeling so on top of the world. If you need that boost of energy and confidence, it’s probably because something else is going wrong in your life. I’d recommend addressing that instead of doing a line.


**Downers**: Benzos and sedatives fall into the same category as uppers for me, if you need them, it’s probably because there’s some other problem you’re not addressing. Plus these suckers can be dangerous, take too many or mix them with alcohol and other sedatives and you might have booked a one way ticket to an out of body experience. That being said, there’s nothing quite like popping a Xanax before you have to deal with something like international travel, just make sure to give yourself lots of extra time.


**Opiates**: I consider these guys to be a class of their own. They are seductive. They feel amazing. Neurologically speaking, they give you the reward stimulus that’s supposed to come from doing something good for yourself, be that getting laid or accomplishing a significant goal. Bypassing that circuit and going straight to the reward is dangerous. Rats will ignore food and stimulate themselves to death if they are given the choice between eating and stimulating the Medial Forebrain Bundle (opioid central). Some people are more susceptible to this than others. I’m lucky, I’ve had scrips for em a few times, and I enjoyed every minute of them, but I never felt the drive to seek out more when I’d finished the prescribed dose. But I have to admit, if I had access to an unlimited supply, I’d probably be high 24/7.


**MJ**: Pot is an interesting one. I consider it to have the potential to be either a sedative or a psychedelic. Like wine, there are a million different kinds, each with their own subtle differences. It can be used to vegetate or to inspire. Under the right circumstances, it can bring you to a state of greater awareness and creativity. If you experience this state enough, you can learn to bring it about without the aid of MJ. I’ve had some success with this, but am still working at it. 


**Synthetic MJ**: tried it twice, once was ok, but weird, not like being high but distinctly altered. The second time felt wrong. Of all the substances I’ve done, never had I experienced anything that felt like it was polluting my brain. **Never again**.


**Salvia**: The stuff in the states is very different from the stuff I tried in Europe. The euro salvia was awesome, inanimate objects took on their own lives and personalities, I remembered dreams from my childhood. It was psychedelic, but completely void of introspection unlike the serotonin psychedelics. It was like peeking into a crazy dimension that could easily be likened to Roger Rabbit’s world. The salvia in the US seems weak, even in extracts supposedly stronger than their euro counterparts.


**DXM**: I’m torn, on one hand it’s both psychedelic and opiate like, on the other hand, the hangover is a bitch and if you’re seeking the fabled 4th plateau or sigma experience, you’re taking dangerous amounts that could result in permanent brain damage or even death. My advice is that if you’re set on doing DXM, do the research, read about all the hospitalizations and ODs. If you’re looking for a life changing experience that will expand your consciousness permanently, the standard LSD, Shrooms, or DMT are a much safer and reliable way to get there. Ketamine and PCP act on the same neurotransmitters, so I imagine they’re similar.


**Dramamine**: Ever wonder what it feels like to not be able to distinguish between the thoughts in your head and external reality? It’s a lot less fun than it sounds, but it made me a lot more empathetic towards schizophrenics.
 

**Alcohol**: Some people may be opposed, but fuck em, I love drinking. Bukowski in a bottle. There’s a reason artists, scientists, and innovators usually have a reputation for hitting the sauce hard. It brings out our primal nature. It’s a celebration of life. It’s a friend in times of great happiness and sorrow alike. It allows us to let go, and live in the moment. There’s a reason control freaks avoid alcohol like the plague. It takes the analytical brain out of the driver’s seat and lets the primate take the wheel for a while. The primate is far smarter than you’d think. As long as you don’t get behind the wheel, alcohol is bitchin’.


In the end, I consider substances useful tools to experience a different state of consciousness. They are like a tour guide, helping you navigate a new realm. Eventually the goal is to venture out without needing a chemical aid.


But don’t be retarded, you only get one brain. There are no do overs if you break it.


As a final note, there are plenty of other substances out there, like anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, beta blocker, and all the rest. I don’t recommend them unless there’s a medical need. The side effects are usually a bitch.

I had an ecstasy dealer who was very reliable, always had great pills, and delivered at any time. His pills were only $10 and they were pokeballs. He wasn't sketchy, he was actually a pretty chill guy. I feel like such a great drug dealer is a rare find.

There was one night I went to my first (and only) rave where I had taken two of his pills, a white butterfly pokeball and a white ghost pokeball. As I was coming up, I got this paranoia that everyone at that rave was a cop. I could not enjoy myself. I scared myself sober and refused to talk to any strangers and make friends because I felt like everyone was out to get me. I no longer had a desire to do drugs. My three years of drug use ended that night. I was only 17.

When I got home that night, I received a text from my reliable dealer telling me he had cocaine asking if I wanted any. If I did not have that experience just hours before, I probably would have but instead I told him the truth. I told him I wanted to stop using drugs. I didn't expect a response, but just minutes after he told me if that is what I truly wanted, he would delete my number and never talk to me again so I wouldn't go back to that lifestyle. 

I've never had a drug dealer so prompt, trustworthy, convenient, and understanding. He never made me feel scared, he never pressured me to buy anything. He was just a good guy doing a good thing.

1. Download/Install Tor Browser Bundle and run it

2. Go to tormail.org and set up an account

3. Go to [SilkRoad -URL removed, but here's a link to the wiki page with the link!-](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) and set up an account

4. Go to bitinstant.com and choose ""Cash deposit"" and ""Send bitcoins to email."" (coinapult)

5. Write down the pin you enter. It will forward you to trustcash. Set up a trustcash cash deposit at a bank close to you.

6. Go to the bank you chose and fill out an ""out of state deposit slip"" with the information trustcash gave you.

7. Bring the **EXACT AMOUNT OF CASH** to the teller and deposit the cash into the account. It's important for it to be exact because that's how they know who to send the cash to.

8. Wait a few hours and check your Tormail, and you should have an email from Coinapult. Click the link, and it will bring you to your wallet on coinapult.

9. *OPTIONAL* Go to instawallet.org, **BOOKMARK/WRITE DOWN THE URL**, copy the bitcoin address on the webpage, and send the coins from your coinapult wallet to your new instawallet. This process of flipping coins through different wallets is called ""tumbling"" your coins.

10. If you did step 9, send your instawallet coins to your silkroad address (bitcoin address can be found by clicking 'account ($0.00)'). If you didn't do step 9, just send the coins from your coinapult wallet."	t5_2qh7l	True

1351871029.0	12inva	Pooping on LSD		867	140	347	"So I took acid for the first time a few days ago with a buddy of mine. I just took one tab, not really sure the dosage but my friend said it was good stuff. He's kind of a veteran, whilst I have only tripped once on shrooms. So anyways we take the LSD around 11am. Prior to this, I had two sausage, egg and cheese McGriddles from McDonald's. And a large coffee. This was my downfall. 

The LSD comes on really strong. Intense visuals, breathing, euphoria. The usual stuff. My thoughts are really jumbled at this point. Everything is just really jumbled in my head. Not clear like it was on shrooms. Then I start to get cramps. It feels kind of intensified. Maybe due to the acid? I don't know. But it causes some anxiety. The cramps fade and I calm down and begin to enjoy the trip. My friend and I are just watching That 70's Show on Netflix at his dorm. Then I have that feeling when poop feels like its about to break through the floodgates and destroy my asshole. I immediately jump up and run down the hall to the bathroom. Unfortunately its a public bathroom and I'm not the only one inside so that causes extra anxiety. I go to the nearest stall and start shitting my soul. I was tripping hard and kind of losing my connection with reality and the feeling of something leaving my body with pain and force really psyched me out. I felt like part of me was dropping out into the toilet. I think I was on the toilet for about 30-45 minutes but it felt like eons. It caused me to have a pretty traumatic experience while I was in the stall. I felt kind of cut off from the real world. 

I finally finished and walked back to my friends room. He was so happy I was back, he said he thought I died or something. I enjoyed the rest of my trip, we ended up walking around the park which was lovely. The only thing was that my asshole was kind of on fire for a while. So, whenever you guys trip, make sure you aren't going to shit your brains out while your peaking. It can make for a bad trip.  "	t5_2qh7l	True

Video games and caffeine were my first two vices. They gripped when I was younger the same way my other habits grip me now.

I had never caught any flak for these addictions, but as time progressed I graduated into substances and habits of greater mindful grandeur. 

Fast-forward to myself as a senior in high-school: good friends, overcoming social awkwardness, and an introduction to the house-party scene. Alcohol suddenly became available. Late nights with friends, drinking til we blacked out and recounting the details the next day. Making up silly drinking games as an excuse to get drunk. Bugging those old enough to buy liquor just so I could have a stash. Drinking my stash by myself because I had nothing better to do. Failing classes. Losing relationships. Going to class drunk.

I'm no longer drinking for fun, and taking Adderall almost daily. Oh hey, I met a guy who sells acid, mushrooms, and MDMA. I wonder how these compare to the legal things I've experimented with?

""Wow,"" I say ""I've never learned so much about myself, who I am, and what I want from life. I can't believe such beautiful things are illegal"". 

Fuck, maybe the whole system is wrong. I've re-evaluated my life so many times over through the use of psychedelics. I've established such great connections with friends. I've come to peace with the way life should be. Life is just about accepting who we and others are... acid has taught me so much... MDMA has given me so many great experiences talking with my friends... mushrooms taught me to be a kid again...

I wonder what other drugs have been given a bad name...

Cocaine? Yeah, I'll try a bump. I'm pretty drunk so anything to sober me up right now would be great. Wow, that sobered me right up. I feel even more confident too. I could talk for hours and feel interesting the whole time. Thanks, buddy. 

Weeks go by, I don't even touch the stuff. I don't even consider it an option. The guy had a little blow and I tried some. Big whoop. I can add that the the list of things I've tried. 

A few more weeks go by and I find myself drinking with this friend once again. I ask him if he has any more, and it turns out the friend he's with is a dealer. I talk to his friend briefly, and then I purchase my first gram of cocaine. This gram lasted me 9 days of partying. 

Hah, people said cocaine was expensive. Maybe on a gram by gram basis, but that $60 goes a long way. I could get high 3 nights a week for 3 weeks. That's the same value as any of the other drugs I've been taking. I don't see the problem. 

I buy a couple more grams over the next few months, usually when I've been drinking already. Slowly but surely a gram doesn't last 9 nights anymore. A gram lasts maybe 2 nights at this point. I slowly come to learn that a lot of my coworkers use cocaine on a regular basis. Oh, so this is now socially acceptable, just like my video game and caffeine habit were when I was younger. Now I've found several dealers, and a connection for much better cocaine than I've been dabbling with. 

Oh, this guy I work with sells cocaine? What do you mean ""hard or soft""? Oh, you sell rock too, I wonder how that compares? Oh shit, this is cheaper and gets you higher? Why was I wasting my money by putting shit up my nose when I can just smoke a purer and cheaper alternative? 

Today is Wednesday, the 12th of June, 2013. It's 6:00am. I never thought I would find myself on a coke bender. I never thought I would ever smoke crack. I never thought I would prioritize getting high over a reasonable amount of sleep before having to work the next day. I never knew I was an addict until my best friend took a good look at me, himself, and our dynamic relationship that lead to this path we're on. As a PSA. Stop using something before you actually have to quit that something.

I use drugs. A lot. But I read about them first. I read Wikipedia. I read the sources cited on Wikipedia. I check them against legitimate medical journals I access through my university's library. I understand the details behind each drug's mechanism of action. I understand terms like ""pharmacodynamics"" and ""serotonergic"". Do I expect others to have the same level of knowledge that I do? Of course not. But it's discouraging to check this and other subreddits/forums daily and see, day after day, the same (to put it bluntly) stupid questions. If you have the time to do a drug, you have to time to google it. No, you can't take an SSRI and LSD. No, shrooms are not a good idea if you're a diagnosed schizophrenic. The answers to these types of questions are extremely obvious. If you don't have the knowledge to answer them yourself, you have no business doing the drug.

That's not to say that there aren't a lot of questions worth asking. Even real neuroscientists aren't entirely sure how things like LSD or DMT, for example, work. But the next person who asks whether or not it's a good idea to take MDMA while on 3 different antidepressants is going to get a serious ragewall of text.

I said “Okay , but don’t go in that field over there…..”,

The DEA officer verbally exploded saying, ” Mister, I have the authority of the Federal Government with me!” Reaching into his rear pants pocket, the arrogant officer removed his badge and shoved it in my face. “See this fucking badge?! This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish…. On any land !! No questions asked or answers given!! Have I made myself clear?…. do you understand?!!”
I nodded politely, apologized, and went about my chores. A short time later, I heard loud screams, looked up, and saw the DEA officer running for his life, being chased by my big old mean bull…… With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he’d sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.I threw down my tools, ran to the fence and yelled at the top of my lungs…..

1365648299.0	1c3z7m	Heroin... The choice I don't regret.	Chetswinghard	903	221	222	"A lot of people tell me every day how much they regret doing heroin. How if it wasn't for heroin they would probably be happy and successful... That heroin ruined their lives and if it wasn't for heroin, they would be 10 times the person they are today...

These are also the same ""friends"" that can't stay clean for more that 3 days and it's all because of the mentality they have towards heroin. Blaming it all on heroin isn't going to get you anywhere. I can't tell you what made me change my mind, or what fueled my withdrawal influenced brain to realize it, but one day I just knew it was all my fault. Every single thing I'd done in the last 2 years had been my choice. A drug didn't control me... It just created a means to justify my horrible, inexcusable actions towards the people I cared for... The people that used to care for me.

From that moment on I've never looked back. I moved out of my home town to a place full of strangers and an empty address book. I puked, shit and cried my way to sobriety but after 21 days I actually woke up and smiled. I was happy again. I remembered what it was like to feel again. Being numb for so long left me hollow. Feeling felt so new, and a long with all the new good feelings came the bad ones.

Every single thing I had done the entire time I was high and numb started crashing down on me. I started hating myself. How could I do the things I did? How could I steal from the people I care about? How can I lie so easily, knowing in the end someones going to get hurt? I realized I was a gigantic piece of shit and things needed to change. I needed to balance out my karma and right all my wrongs.

I spent the next year and a half struggling to stay clean, fighting back urges to use and peer pressure to relapse. Improving my social skills and learning how to be a real friend rather than someone who's just trying to get one over on you. Learning to eat like a normal person again, and how to sleep on a normal schedule, or to sleep at all.

So on my 23rd birthday (January 29th, 1 year and 184 days clean) I took time to look back and really form a solid view on the way things have happened in the last 18 months.

I learned you can never blame something for the mistakes you make. All you'll do is continue to make the same mistakes and never learn. Never grow. I learned that without heroin I would never be the man I am today. I would never have developed such a strong sense of willpower and dedication. I would never have felt what it's like to hurt the people that loved you the most. To watch them cry on the ground in fear of you. I would never have learned working hard and earning what you have feels 100x times better than stealing it. I wouldn't have learned how to feel again. I would have never became the empathetic, caring man I am today. I wouldn't have dropped my cynical attitude towards life and other people, and I certainly wouldn't have the friends I have today.

TLDR; To some this all up I'm glad I did heroin because heroin didn't make me a horrible person, I did. But It did help me to become the strong, smart, responsible, caring, loving, and dedicated man I am today. Admit to yourself it was your fault and move on. Since the day I woke up and realized all this I have accomplished the following personal goals I NEVER thought I could do, and you could do it too!

    Stopped Smoking (ciggs and weed)
    Stopped Biting my nails.
    Started exorcizing heavily every day (I'm down from 345 to 255, Fuck you laziness)
    I learned Spanish (Hola!)

Just believe in yourself. Stop using the drug as a crutch for your justifications and I guarantee you life will get better. Take it one day at a time! I BELIEVE IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!

With as much sincerity as I can muster, Nick.

EDIT: I do not actually attribute my success to heroin. This is what I like to call ""finding the silver lining"". It was just the catalyst that helped me help myself; It helped me by creating obstacles to overcome, not by literally making life better after I'd do some.. So before it gets pointed out again I'd just like to say I would NEVER justify using heroin and would like to warm EVERYONE that heroin will grab a hold of you after just one use. METH, not even once... I mean Heroin.

Its been fun. Ive seen the posts in the past, where people say its time to quit drugs and for some reason, not knowing the person at all, not even seeing them on reddit before; I disliked them as a person. I never thought it was a good thing. That was probably the *very immature*, ""hardcore"", bang all the cocaine till your nose is bleeding~Smoke all the meth till the shadows are talking to you part of me. But I see what ive become and I hate myself for it. I never knew what addiction was. I thought it was some painful I NEED THIS DRUG OR IM NOT GOING TO BE OKAY feeling, and for some drugs it can be. But its not for me. Tho I am addicted in other ways that the only possible outcome is very negative. Im going to MA meetings to coincide with changing my circle of ""friends"". 

Im also going to quit smoking in all of this, Im not going to say after I quit drugs il quit cigarettes because I know I wont. I just crushed my last few cigarettes.

I plan on joining a gym again and getting my life back on track. 

I think I will still smoke weed but im not sure I even want to do that. Not in fear of doing hard core drugs again, I just am not sure I want to be high anymore.

Just glad I have the right mindset now and dont believe there is any chance of relapse as I have NO urge to get high again besides mentally and physical withdraws, my mind is right.

I still love to browse /drugs tho. Its been a blast, but more of a nightmare. 

Just letting you know, im out.

The intention is that they will serve as a fantastic resource, with a particular focus on advice for first time users. Experienced users are generally a bit better at doing their own research.

So please, add any questions you think would generate good answers, taking care to keep any answers on topic. This is more about information that anything else, so please report dangerously incorrect information and anything else that's out of place. 

Try to ask and answer questions which are **specific to LSD**. We will be doing a general psychedelics guide in the coming weeks, when I have thought of some good questions to ask. Suggest them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/w7rxt/rdrugs_ama_index/).

Today we happen upon LSD, arguably the most important and recognizable psychedelic drug in the history of western civilization.

----

**First synthesis:** 1938 by Albert Hofmann. Fun fact: he was also the first to use it but did so accidentally!

**Intended use:** Fun fact #2: was originally produced by what is now Novartis and marketed as a psychiatric drug for treating a wide variety of mental ailments, ranging from alcoholism to sexual deviancy. As a highly controlled substance in modern times, it's only use is as an entheogen and recreational drug.

**[Current research into medical applications:](http://www.maps.org/research/)** Alleviating anxiety for terminally ill cancer patients coping with their impending deaths,  treating/preventing cluster headaches.

**Legality:** Illegal in almost every country, though several of those allow for possession with a license. A handful of countries (Mexico, The Netherlands, The Czech Republic, Portugal) have decriminalized possession under a certain amount.

The first hit changed me, it changed the way I think, the way I talk to people, the way I think about advertising, marketing, business, everything.

I feel like I can see right through anything. Any movie I watch I am just thinking they are actors and a camera. Any TV ad I just know they are a person you doesn't care about a product, selling me something I don't need and won't buy. 
Anyone I talk to I feel like they are never genuine. I can't relate to anyone. My friends seem distant to me now, although I hang around them a lot. I honestly feel as though nobody actually knows who I really am and that everyone puts on a face/disguise to cover up who they are. I feel like I can tell immediately when someone is lying or covering something up, like after LSD I can read faces/eyes better and in real time.
Everyone I work with is doing a terrible job, I spend most of my time fixing everyone's mistakes and chasing up people up for work who should be chasing me up.

Has anyone ever felt like this after LSD? It seems to have opened my eyes to what the world really is like, and it bores me. It has made me realise that I spend all my time working with idiots, hanging out with people I don't think I know and living in a world that doesn't make sense.

I know it was the LSD that changed the way I think. Is this depression? I know I never thought this 'outside' way before to what my normal life is like. I used to think my life was normal and everything is fine. I enjoy having a new outlook but it has made me feel distant from all the sheep in the world, going about their day jobs stressing over the dumbest things. Nothing worries me anymore.

Anyone else have this happen? Can anyone offer any advice?

Its basically the first time I actually wanted to quit meth besides the few days here and there where I was sleeping or had no meth. I sit here waiting for the cravings to go away such as with weed but I learned they never do, they just slowely subside over time but never fully go away. Its a ever lasting battle and I have experienced a new colour that I (hopefully) will never see again. Just a word of advice to anyone interested in doing meth or have plans to in the near future: If you do meth expect to do it again, and if you dont you always have something, part of yourself, will be empty. Just not there. Im not sure what else to say besides that. I got over the depression/suicidal part (I think) but even as I sit here now I have to consciously fight against hitting up my dealer for more. Just my 2 cents.

""A gram and .3"", he replied. 

WHAT. I told him he better have meant 130mg else he is going to be hospitalized tonight. ""Dude, that's ~$70 of drugs straight to the face. No way you're taking that much.""

""lol I bought $60 worth tonight, don't worry dude I'll be fine!""

No, he won't be fine. And I tried to explain this to him. But he wouldn't listen. 'He knows.' Oh, and the girl he's with (I love her, whatever) is taking .8. Jesus. 

I still don't know if he's going to listen to me. Whatever. I tried. And it pisses me off that he wouldn't even consider my suggestions. It's the dumb fucking kids like my friend who ruin the whole idea of responsible drug use in the first place. It's the kids like him that cause these drugs to become banned.

1352466699.0	12wtdw	A Rave Mistake	e_mote	742	170	294	"I purchased turntables soon after I started smoking weed with friends in high school at age 15. Newfound insight and social reinforcement lifted me from depression and I was filled with eager energy. After a gauntlet of experimentation, I became very fond of LSD. My record collection grew, and I began to play parties. I began to partake in drugs openly among large groups. I felt happy.

Weeks after my eighteenth birthday I attended yet another party. I attended alone, with my records and a gram of molly. I advertised my drugs in hope to break even on what I'd payed for them, but found no committed buyers. One individual offered to trade for a piece of paraphernalia, but after I declined gave me the item anyway. Following my sunset mix, I enthusiastically consumed a hit of blotter from an unknown in the crowd. Soon afterwards I eyeballed a dose of MDMA, perhaps in the range of 0.1-0.3, and took it.

At the onset of the trip, saw a girl who attended my high school, but she sat alone in the corner looking dejected. Everyone was dancing but her. At this point I realized why she was there, and why she looked sad. Her boyfriend was a cop on the team busting the party that night, and she was torn between her loyalty to him and her friendship with me. Struck with this realization, the panic developed very quickly. Unsure what to do with this information, I rejoined my new acquaintances and considered warning them. As I reached the group, I saw the fellow who had gifted me the paraphernalia - he was throwing an empty baggy into a fire. Failing to mention anything I took the cue to run back to my car to ditch the rest of the molly and weed I possessed. Rolling hard as shit now, I violently dug through the interior of the car looking for something I couldn't remember. In the walk from the fire I had tripped out enough to forget what I was getting from the car. So I sat there and tried to think. As I waited for sense to come to me, I looked to my right in the direction of the chill out room. Strangely, the mother of the property owner, who I had met earlier in the day, was sitting alone in the chill out area. She was in her 60s, it was probably 10 or 11PM, and she was waving her arms as if she were an orchestra conductor commanding the the fidget house or psy breaks or whatever was playing. Here it all came together: it was a trap, she had been contacted by law enforcement to allow a mock party to take place on her premises so cops could net drug users. My drugs! I now remembered why I was in the car, and grabbed the ecstasy, weed, and pipes and grinders and lighters and anything sketchy and dumped it all in a bag. I distinctly remember being so high I couldn't think of the word for 'bag'. To my left, flashlights were rummaging through the camping tents people had set up that day, and I knew I was at the bottleneck. The arrests beginning only 30 ft. away. I dumped my bag of shit, including the paraphernalia that had been given to me by the stranger earlier, and thought I was safe. I called the person who had invited me to the party, because I didn't want to warn him in front of others and alarm everyone. When he picked up the phone, I immediately caught my tongue - he was the one who invited me there, and he was in on it. In fact, his entire crew must have been. The rest of the evening I tried not to talk to anyone, but scurried around trying to find somebody responsible who could help. I was candyflipping harder than ever before.

In the morning I woke up in my car and knew it was all a delusion. There had been no cops, everything was coincidence and acid illusion. I drove home to everyday life. But the lingering effects persisted, and I soon became very unsure if it was in fact fiction, or not. Anxiety gripped me during the next week. I destroyed every party flyer I had collected, and all photographs of my friends, no matter the context. Waves of heat and trembling would overtake my body during waking hours, and dreams were composed of scenes of running through the woods trying to hide my backpack. Every nook and cranny of my life became illustrated in the story, and all of my observations led me back to believing the delusion.

Weeks before graduation, while at a friend's apartment, I ran into a familiar face. My friend was smoking a blunt with a man I was sure I recognized, but could not name. Despite any degree of uncertainty, I took it that this was one of the guys I was on the lookout for. I feigned illness or tiredness and immediately returned to my parents' home, where I packed sweaters and cash and a couple pictures of my mom and dad into a bag and ran away. For a couple weeks I didn't appear in school, the police looked for me after my parents filed a missing person report, and I skipped around town squatting.
It was this week that I became suicidal. I kept a blade on me at all times, during any state of dress, in case I was found and had to kill myself to escape. I was still on the fence about whether or not it was a delusion, though, and I eventually met with my sister so my family would know I was still OK. She comforted me and bent over backwards to enable me to return to school, which was in another city, to graduate. The entire last weeks of school I carried a blade, waiting to barricade myself in the bathroom and slit my wrists when the officers came to get me.

I began to place markers on time to bargain for my sanity. I told myself that if nothing happened by graduation I was safe. Graduation came, and this marker just moved ahead. I told myself that if nothing happened by the end of summer I was fine. I lay on my couch the whole summer with the front door locked, looking out the window. My parents thought I had become lazy and criticized me, but I did not tell them anything. The end of summer came, and the marker just moved ahead. I decided they wanted to work with the university police to build up a profile on my habits and connections, and then arrest me after my first semester. This went on for three years, the marker moving forward, as I lay waiting to kill myself.

With time I moved away from the event and met a young girl. She relieved much of my stress because she represented a new life. She had no connection to anyone I knew and provided a haven outside of my hometown where I felt fairly secure. I was not without troubles, however, and wondered many times if our meeting was concocted by the same force I was hiding from. Eventually, after years, I confided in her. I told her the story very meticulously, and emphasized my inability to process the event. The weight did not magically lift. She had no idea what to say, and said the wrong thing. A fight ensued, and she retired to the locked bathroom to shower. All hope vanished when that door locked. The years of pent up despair did not unravel, but tightened. Out of options, I walked the dog to the neighborhood park, leashed her to a bench, sat down and cut my wrists. I was very sad to be doing this, and the dog seemed to know something was wrong, so she started barking. That's how my girlfriend found me, and soon the police arrived. I was taken to the hospital where my sister works as an ER nurse.

The next week or so I spent in a psychiatric ward, and felt very out of place. The people around me were certified nuts, except for the handful there withdrawing from opiates. I was discharged fairly quickly and returned to university classes.

I struggle daily with delusional thoughts about people. Often, small gestures people make become signals to me, as if they they are using baseball signals to send codes to each other. I have emotional breakdowns and anxiety attacks weekly. I have closed most people out of my life. I abuse drugs. I am still not done with my university degree. I have sold and trashed most of my music and instruments. I have seen many therapists. I consider suicide daily. I don't want this anymore.

First of all, I must apologise. In the original thread I promised various forms of documentation such as photos, video or music. I soon realised that, in the heat of the moment, rolling balls with the guy who created me, that promise would be swiftly disregarded and replaced with basking in ecstasy and savouring existence in that short frame in time. Sorry.

As for the story... 10am wake-up. My dad was in the living room scanning a newspaper. ""So... you're on holiday now"", I said with a sly grin and pointedly raised eyebrows. Little discussion was needed and I went upstairs and retrieved the MDMA, which I weighed out into a 130mg bomb for him and 170mg one for me. We raised our doses with a 'cheers' and he remarked ""No going back now"".

By around the 40 minute mark his pupils were bigger than the devil's balls and it was time to pick up the guitars. Simon and Garfunkel, the Jayhawks, James Taylor and others all flowed effortlessly with the synergy that MDMA brings to two people with musical instruments. As he started to peak, signified by the characteristic first-time roller mumbles of ""Hollly shiiit"" and ""Phwooar"", he asked me to play [Kathy's song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXZyDtzDJMY) while he laid back and drifted along with the waves of euphoria. I thought about the magic in the fact that as a baby, he used to play me The Boxer to get me to sleep at night, and now I am here, 19 years later, playing him a song from the same artist into a different kind of dream world. Memories of rolling tend to slip away over time, but that's not one that will be so easily forgotten.

The rest of the time was well spent stroking my comically fat, fluffy cat, taking turns to put on songs and chatting about my dad's drug days in comparison to my ongoing ones.

The experience was not what I had expected. I expected bubbly father-son love ramblings and firm hugs and handshakes, but the father-son relationship barrier was trampled by the MDMA and it was like I was sitting there with the 19-year old version of my dad. Like two best friends chilling and jamming out to their favourite songs.

I wish I could write more about what an experience it was, but as anyone who has taken MDMA knows, it is near enough indescribable and the memories of it are few and far between. However, you can always be sure that you had a fucking great time and the knowledge of that, for me, is enough to make up for the lack of memory.

1364228735.0	1azaqq	A Schizophrenic's Take on Drug Use		672	114	178	"Hello druggit,

I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was 19 years old and since that time (3 years) I've been hospitalized for psychiatric problems 5 times.  I've spent a good 4 months of the last 3 years in a hospital or long term psychiatric treatment facility.  I wanted to make this post because I believe, and I'm not saying this is correct, that my illness was made much worse by my drug use.  I didn't use drugs until I was 18 years old, but once I stepped out of my house and was on my own I began to experience severe mood disturbances and mild auditory hallucinations (hearing police sirens for extended periods of time and occasional voices).  I began using marijuana and enjoyed the experience so much that I instantaneously began abusing it.  Some nights I remember buying a quarter ounce bag and smoking the entire thing in one night. 

My connections were sparse so I used any drug I could find.  I abused cough syrup as well and ended up in the emergency room twice because I had extremely prolonged trips.  I would usually take around 600 to 700 mg of DXM and completely black out, only remembering sounds of people screaming around me when I woke up in the emergency room.

Things really went bad when I ordered 2c-e online.  At this time I was becoming increasingly detached from reality and felt extreme emotional pain.  I took 20 to 30 mg at first and I enjoyed it.  After this though I don't remember much of the next few days other than the fact that I injested over 17 25 mg capsules and the next thing I remember I had completely destroyed my laptop, my lamp, had scars all over my arms and legs, was sweating profusely and was going in and out of consciousness.  I don't remember much else except for the fact that my roommate had called the police and I was acting so erratic and bizarre that I was sent in for observation at a psychiatric hospital.  I spent over 6 weeks there and every day I made frenetic attempts at running away, holding my breath until I passed out, stabbing myself with sharpened plastic silverware, and slamming my head against walls and furniture to the point I was forcibly restrained several times.  I wasn't diagnosed with anything but instead was released after stabilised and sent to a drug rehabilitation facility.  It was there were I  started experiencing severe psychotic symptoms and after being sent to the hospital again was put on Haldol, Trazadone, Depakote and Cogentin.  Over the next month my symptoms started improving but the problems I had with my mood still lingered around.

I could say a lot more about my story and I left a lot of gaps in it but it would probably fill an entire book.  I just wanted to say that anybody with mental illness should just be aware that using drugs could make their problems worse.  For me drug use was like an on - off valve, I couldn't simply use recreationally, it was either black out by smoking 7 blunts a night or use nothing at all.  Today I just choose to abstain from drugs but it doesn't mean I don't believe some people can be helped by them.

There is a lot of great discussion on using drugs here, and sometimes memorials for those lost to addiction, but there doesn't seem to be enough about addiction itself here. 

I believe the reason most people fall into addiction is because they have no idea what to look for, the severity of it, and how to avoid it in the first place. 

&gt;For those who have experienced addiction, what should you look for when using a drug to know its coming?

&gt;What can you do if you are ramping up into addiction?

&gt;How can one use an addictive substance but avoid addiction?

&gt;How do you spot addiction in others?

&gt;How do you help someone who is addicted?

EDIT: I am adding three questions:

&gt;Does dependence equate addiction? In other words, if a doctor puts me on benzos for three months with full knowledge that I will become dependent, am I an addict? Or just dependent?

&gt;If you have been addicted to a substance, can you ever use it again, or use other substances again without addiction? 

&gt;For those of you who have been addicts, how has it changed you as a person? How has it changed your current drug use?

Please add questions or answer them if you have the experience. Hopefully this will help some people, or keep alot of people out of trouble in the first place. Drugs have their upsides, but the downsides can be pretty shitty too :("	t5_2qh7l	True
1369150489.0	1erobv	My guide to figuring out if what you bought is really LSD!	WishIlivedintheNL	688	140	286	"Hi everyone, I've been stocking up for festival season and I've started to notice the usual large quantities of bunk/fake LSD.  I've been at the game for a while and figured I could put together a kind of checklist for identifying if what you really bought is LSD!

I'm gonna lay it out in a sort of checklist kind of way, so bear with me.  If you see anything you think is wrong/different let me know and I'd love to respond.

Before I start all of this I'm gonna talk a little about test kits and LSD. There are two kits that can help you determine if you have LSD. The Marquis and Erlich reagent (THE erlich reagent is the commercially available LSD tester from Bunk police, easytest, NicU, etc.).  I've never really used a marquis on LSD, I think you're pushing your luck.  With regards to the Erlich I really do not trust it.  I know that it triggers in the presence of an indole, and when you look at the chart it's clear LSD is the only drug that can fit on blotter; However, I've spoken with many people in the RC scene and it is very common for people to dilute their bunk drugs with a very easy to purchase indole.  That means, that if someone is laying a sheet of bunk L all they have to do is grind up some melatonin and put it in their solution.  If they do that their shit will trigger an Erlich test.

Step 1:  Trust your source

This is kind of a bullshit one but from my experience you need to trust your guy. Always ask if he's taken some of the drugs he's about to sell you. If he has you need to ask him the following (this is why you need to trust he isn't bullshitting you on his response)

1.  How long did the trip last (it should be between 10-14 hours)

2.  Did you mouth feel numb when you took it.  Real LSD should not numb your tongue at all! A few times I've had some it has numbed it a little but if you can't feel your tongue you've got bunk shit. (If anyone says they could ""taste the acid"" it was probably bunk as fuck)

3.  How did you take the tab/dose? (If your guy says you HAVE to keep it in your mouth to trip then it's not L, I'll talk more about this later)

4. How many did you take?  (FROM MY EXPERIENCE most LSD is layed/dosed out at around 50-60 micrograms, at that dosage your trip normally is)

1 dose-you feel a little funny and can drink/smoke as much as you want

2 dose-colors are vivid, things look closer or further than normal, some tracers

3 dose-Things look funny, mild pattern shifting, definitely know you're tripping hard. 

If any of the questions to your dealer seem a little off or he responds with any of the negative responses I've listed above then you should tread carefully and maybe only buy a few hits to try it out first.

Step 2: Form factor

LSD comes in a couple different forms.  The most common I've seen are blotter, liquid drops, or liquid dropped on some sort of candy. I'll handle each form factor one at a time.

Blotter: There are a few things that I look for when someone shows me blotter they believe to be LSD.

* Size -Like I said above, the active dose for lsd is 50-150 micrograms.  The active dose for a 25x-nbome is 600-1200 micrograms!  The first thing I look for in blotter is size.  I have NEVER seen a blotter of LSD that was larger than .5 cm by .5 cm,  the tab should be small enough to fit on your pinky nail pretty comfortably.  Anything larger than that should raise immediate questions.

* Texture -  The LSD on blotter I've gotten has a very non-specific feel to it.  Because there is such a small amount of crystal in each paper your blotter should feel like normal paper.  It should be pliable, soft, and bend how you would expect paper of its thickness to bend.  Fake shit has such a higher dosage quantity, as a result of this when it is layed onto blotter the blotter will be very hard and rigid.  If you have small tabs that are shiny/rigid/not bendable you probably have bunk shit. This is because the crystals are much more numerous and permeate throughout the whole paper

* Taste- Some blotter/Acid solutions can be a little bitter. This means you can taste whatever is in your mouth but that's really it.  If you have something like a 25x then your mouth will be unbelievably numb.  You won't feel your tongue, cheek, lips, etc til the tabs have been out of your mouth for a while.

Liquid (I don't have a lot of experience with liquid, so bear with me)

* Look for the same things I just mentioned, you should not feel your mouth going super numbed when you drop it. You should come up within 45-90 minutes and the trip should last 9-12 hours.  

Candy 

* If possible look at the dose under black light. The areas with Dropped LSD should fluoresce.

* With candy I have also gotten a DOx chemical.  The only way to really tell is if you've been tripping for 15-18 hours you probably have this instead of LSD. One thing to remember is that like the 25x-nBOME's the dosage for DOC is 1-8mg.  This means there will be a lot of chemical on the medium (this on is hard to tell besides taking some and feeling it out)

Step 2: So, you bought some and it made it through the above checklist now what?

At this point it is time to do some experimenting. This applies for all form factors. 

1. Eat 1 tab and enjoy.  Your trip should be awesome, pretty mellow, and last 9-12 hours.  At this point you could find out you have DOC, or have been given super large doses.  

2.  If possible trip with a friend and have him swallow the blotter, candy, or liquid straight to his stomach.  For example, if you had doses on altoids I would suggest having one friend keep it in his mouth and the other swallow it straight like a pill.  If the person who swallowed it trips then you are able to rule out the 25i series.  

Step 3: Make a moral decision. 

If you have bunk shit you need to decide what you're going to do with it. From my experience most people will still buy it if you just describe it as NOT LSD.  You can sell it for a normal price if you're upfront with people. Explain to them that this is a drug a lot like LSD but it isn't.  Let them know not to take more than 2 doses for their own safety and go on your way.

Step 4: Enjoy

Hopefully you followed this guide and didn't get bunked, prepare to enjoy some amazing trips with one of the best drugs on the planet."	t5_2qh7l	True

Sounds stereotypical but it's true. I want to share with all of you my story because I know you guys will listen and enjoy it as well as I am right now.  No experience with any drugs beforehand besides weed and alcohol, but even then, it was very light experience.



Started at 2. Wrote ""You will be okay"" on my hand. Learned that from here. Took my shrooms and it wasn't as bad as I thought. People were complaining about the flavor but I enjoyed it in a way. I like mushrooms anyway. Sat around, started a movie up that James Bond one I can't remember. Recent one. But it was slow so I stopped. Wanted to go out because it was a very nice day so I went out. Decided Woah this is not a good idea so I went back home. Walked and then took a stare at my lawn. It was moving. They were planning against me man. Just like that haha. Then a woman came up and startled me. I went inside after that. 
I'm typing this on mobile so excuse the lack of formatting my friends. Anyway, I go inside, head to my room and just stared. It was amazing. My ceiling is textured so that was cool already but it was.... Moving.... Amazing... I couldn't stop staring. Thought man.. This was it? It's cool but not worth the money I spent.. My dog is scratching to come inside at this point. I bring her in and she was tired so we just layed and I closed my eyes. I wasn't sleeping. I was living another life. 4 different lives. My dog was a police sniper in one life. My dog was a k9 in another. Then there was me just laying there. And then the next life. It fucking hit me reddit it fucking hit me. I was looking at people carrying a casket and I was just watching wondering who it was and feeling remorse for them. Then it fucking hit me guys. It was me. That was me in there. I was dead. Then I opened my eyes and I was alive. I came to realize that I have been treating my life like it's nothing and that what I just saw would be a reality if I didn't be careful. I got up. I got some water. I sat back down. I let it sink in. Texted my best friend about it. She wasn't responding. I let it sink it deeper. I talked to her about it to myself and it helped some. Then I decided to head out because it was a very good day. 


Then I looked at my hand reddit I looked at my hand. It said you will be okay. I realized that that can be applied to many things. Not just a silly drug trip. To life. That if you know you will be okay then nothing can bother you because you will be okay. And that's when the real trip began reddit. I was happy with myself. I would be okay. I had been going through a very very rough patch in my life but I would be okay reddit. Walked around to the park. On the way there I saw a rock broken into two. I passed by it and the other stopped and went back to pick it up. It was like my life. It was broken in half, had been through some shit, but I was going to make it okay reddit. I carried it with me. I walked to the park. I watched the water sparkle. I walked some more. I saw my life reddit. I saw it while I was living it. I saw young love. I saw a couple. A young couple. I passed by them. The guys face as he twirled and threw flowers and his carelessness. That was young love reddit.



I continued on my journey. Treaded onwards. Held onto my rock that reminded me that I will be okay. Then I saw a man reddit. He was with a walker. Not a person. A walker and he was going slow. There were some kids in front of him I assumed was his but it wasn't I later found out. All I could think was how strong he was for walking. He was in his 70s probably and walking. That was my future self reddit. I walked past him. I looked back. He wasn't far. I walked back catching up to him. I wanted to talk. But I figured it would be too weird so I stopped at a overpass of the sort in the pathway. I was just happy that I had seen my life right now and that all would be okay.



I walked. Walked. Walked. Reddit I walked. I looked down, picked up a very small pebble and flung it. That was my troubles. I flung my troubles reddit. That made me feel good. I picked up a bigger pebble. Flung it. That was my hate. I flung all my hate away. Then I picked up the biggest pebble I could find and flung it my hardest. I almost fell. That was all the negativity in my life. My god that was good. Then I continued walking. Saw a man sitting on a bench and figured I would sit next to him and talk. I wanted it to be the man I saw earlier with a walker. I wanted it to be. I walked. 



Lo and behold........ It was him. I ran. I ran to him. I slowed. I speed walked. I wanted to sit with him. He got up. I was a little dapper. He walked my way. We passed each other without a word. I sat where he sat. I enjoyed the view. Then I worked up the courage reddit. I walked after him. I caught up to him. I said excuse me sir. You are very strong you know that. You are still walking and you are very strong for that. He proceeded to tell me that he had a stroke last April that left him like that. I asked if I could walk with him and we walked reddit. And then he told me about his life. We eventually reached the end of our journey and he thanked me for listening to him. We parted ways and I informed my best friend if what just happened.  I stood at the bridge I was at earlier and took in the view.  It was beautiful.  Life was grand.  I then decided to go get something to eat as I figured I was coming down now.  I start walking to Carls Jr to try their new bourbon burger because I heard it was pretty good and the idea of food to bring me back was nice.  


I hear an ice cream truck and see it stop next to me.  Two kids run towards it.  It made me smile because I remember doing that as a kid too.  They had $2 for the both of them and got Takis, a spicy chip.  I pulled out some money and gave it to them because hey, when I was a kid, I never had enough money for what I wanted.  They asked me if I was sure and I assured them it was fine and to get ice cream or something.  It was like reliving my childhood in a way.  I walked away and one of the kids chases after me and hands me a bag of Takis saying ""Hey mister.  Thanks.  Take this!""  I thanked the kid profusely and just smiled.  I made his day better and that's all I can ask for because I'm happy with life already.  I've reached nirvana.  I want nothing.


Walk, walk, walk, eventually reach Carls Jr.  The very nice girl at the register asked if I wanted to try their bourbon burger.  Perfect!  I said sure!  And eventually I got my burger.  I sat there eating it.  I looked around and took in the view.  There was a couple, a white couple.  Some would call them rednecks but the man was happy.  He was smiling.  Nothing can take that away from him at that moment.  I look and see a black gentleman.  Excuse me for being racist but I judged him.  But then I came to the realization he was just like me.  He was here for food and he was just like me.  I look at the girl that served me.  She's not happy with life reddit.  She's stuck with this minimum wage job and it sucks because she wants better, but that's all she can do at the moment.  Then these two ladies come in with two kids.  The two kids run straight for the playground but the door was locked.  They kept trying to go but the door just wouldn't budge.  They called one of the ladies over (presumably a mom or sister) and they try to open it but then they notice the sign that said it was closed.  They were sad.  I was sad.  I felt bad.  Those children just wanted to play on the playground.  The lady said she'll get them ice cream instead and I felt a little better.  But then they all left......the kids without the playground or ice cream.  I wanted to stop the lady and remind her about the ice cream but I figured that'd be a little crazy...


Then I started writing this.  I wrote, wrote, and wrote.  Occasionally looked up at the playground then realized hey I don't have to be here.  I can write out there.  I continued to write then looked at the sunset.  It was beautiful.  I called up my best friend and talked to her about it.   Then I recalled my entire trip so far to her.  She's a chill person and knew I was on shrooms but I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm crazy.  And then we talked about life.....And it got really cold so I decided to go home.  And here I am reddit!  On my computer now, typing this at the very moment.  I copied what I had on my phone and emailed it to myself to continue on the computer.  


I'm still coming down from the trip.  But I'm still very happy.  I'm happy with life reddit.  It's one of the most amazing feelings ever.

We now move from one exceptionally famous drug to another on day five in our series of community AMA's. Today's AMA subject, MDMA, is a favourite of club, festival and party goers but has recently been given quite a bad name by inexperienced/uneducated users and the news agencies that report on them.

**Intended use:** No legal uses as of yet. The only widespread use is as a recreational [entactogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entactogen).

[**Current research into medical applications:**](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/) Showing great potential in treating PTSD and anxiety due to cancer in American and Swiss studies (with researchers in Jordan, Israel and Canada waiting on approval for their own studies). Currently, MDMA is one of the most, if not *THE* most, studied illicit drug. It's impending illegality in the late 80's was the main reasons MAPS was created.

**Legality:** Illegal in almost every country, though several of those allow for possession with a license. A handful of countries (The Netherlands, The Czech Republic, Portugal) have decriminalized possession under a certain amount.

**A concise guide for first time users.** If you still have specific questions afterwards, please ask!

So you've decided to take MDMA. Good for you! It is a very safe, enjoyable drug when used responsibly and can catalyse the growth of some incredible friendships.

Here at /r/drugs we're passionate about people enjoying themselves while also staying safe. We get a lot of people asking about what to do and what to expect and we can't answer everyone in the same detail so we've tried to put together a ""one-stop"" guide which is both concise and informative. It won't cover everything, but it should give you a good basis on which to ask the ""right"" questions for things you want more detail on.

* What is MDMA?

MDMA is a stimulant drug which creates powerful feelings of love, happiness and social openness. Users remain very lucid and in-control with moderate doses, easily able to walk, talk and dance.

* Getting it safely:

MDMA is typically a grey or slightly tan crystalline powder, but many other drugs also look like this. The best way to be sure what you have is MDMA and not meth or or something else is to use a [marquis kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_reagent), which can be bought [online](https://www.google.com/search?q=buy+marquis+reagent).

MDMA also comes in pressed pills which can be adulterated too. You can check your pills using a [marquis kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_reagent) or on [pillreports](http://www.pillreports.com/index.php).

* Using it:

MDMA is quite a safe drug but regular use causes irreversible tolerance after 5-10 uses, suggesting some damage to the parts of the brain it affects. Suggested first doses are between 110 - 160mg. It is *highly* recommended that you find a friend with some scales or buy some for [under $15](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=aca&amp;q=scales#q=scales+buy+0.001g&amp;tbm=shop).

You should drink an normal amount of water for the activity you are doing. MDMA does not cause dehydration but dancing in a busy rave can. Drinking alcohol, a depressant, can dull the effects, cause dehydration, nausea and other unpleasant problems. Being tipsy is fine but getting drunk is definitely worth avoiding. 

* Overdoing it: (

MDMA is a very safe drug when not mixed with other drugs, so serious injury is unlikely, but it's certainly not good news. Too much is characterised by extreme sweating/overheating, difficulty reading, realistic hallucinations, nausea and confusion. If you are feeling unwell and you cannot quickly find a friend, seek medical help. MDMA users are quite pleasant for first aiders to treat because they are so compliant so don't hang around worrying about being a nuisance. Nothing is more important than your health.

* Afterwards:

As your experience comes to an end you *will* want to redose. Nobody ever wants it to end. Unfortunately it won't get you back to where you were, will stave off sleep, will increase the comedown from near-nothing to something and increases the small amount of damage we mentioned before. 

MDMA is not toxic like alcohol so you will not have a hangover, but if you spent the night dancing when you'd usually be asleep you will be tired and drained. If you have a lot you will feel a little low because you have used up your brain's supply of serotonin. This effect tends to peak 3 days after rolling and then disappear quickly.

* I LOVED IT, when can I do it again?

Just like taking too much, too often also seems to produce an irreversible loss of effects suggesting some sort of damage. It is recommended that you leave *at least* a month between uses, ideally 2-3. the more you take, of course, the larger your breaks ought to be. Having MDMA as a ""special occasions only"" sort of thing makes it surprisingly easy to use sparingly."	t5_2qh7l	True

This was my second time tripping, and the first time around a lot of people. I took four hits of some pretty strong acid, according to my friends, who have experience with lots of different dosages and potencies of acid. My trip was on the last day of Bonnaroo of this year, so about almost a week ago now. 

I took my tabs around 3 PM and started walking with my friends into the festival grounds. The walk was about 30 minutes, and by the time I got up there, I was coming up hard. I felt amazing, and the combination of music and people really excited me. I never felt scared during my entire trip. The acid was really starting to take hold of me as I was headed towards Kendrick Lamar's set, and that's also when I think my transformation started, so to speak. 

For the first time in my life, all of my social anxiety went away. I was introducing myself to everyone, dancing with random people, and enjoying myself without really worrying about judgement. My mind was open and I was open and I was excited.

After Kendrick's set, I was in full swing tripping balls mode. My friends were shifting through the crowds without moving, and I was just gliding through the crowds in what felt like a guided coma. I was walking aimlessly but with a purpose, letting in all of the sounds and sights of a music festival. I finally found a good place to be outside of Tame Impala's set. I laid down on my back and started listening to all of the sounds coming in, all of them crystal clear. 

I don't know if this is how everyone experiences acid, or if this is how everyone reacts to it, but for me, acid enabled me to hear everyone's individual conversations, tones, and even allowed me to be able to tell if they were enjoying themselves. 

The conversations I heard were very telltale of my generation, and myself, in a way. I heard tons of people talking, and I could hear their tones, and when people sounded upset, mad, bored, or any negative emotion, they were almost exclusively talking about their cell phones. 

I realized how much my generation has started to rely on their phones as a form of constant entertainment, as well as how much my generation cares about social media. And I realized how much that resembled me. Before Bonnaroo, I almost constantly had my phone on my person, using twitter and Instagram to share my experiences. At Bonnaroo, however, I didn't have my phone with me at all. I used to essentially live through my phone, always checking it for notifications and ignoring the world right in front of me. In the days since my trip, I've almost completely disregarded my phone outside of using it to make plans with people, contact work, and listen to music. It's been an amazing transformation, and I've felt more connected to every experience I've had since, no matter how small, because instead of distracting myself with social media and other people who aren't involved with the experience, I'm now much more involved with the actual experience. 

The other realization I came to at Bonnaroo was that my life was not as important to other people as I used to think. By that, I mean that people aren't paying attention to me. I used to worry that people would be looking at me while I was just doing my own thing, but I never made the connection that while I was busy living my life, other people are too busy living their own lives to notice mine. It's quite relieving in a way. It's refreshing, even.

I've been able to be myself a lot more ever since my trip, and I've been much happier in everything I do. To everyone who has experienced something similar to what I have, I'm glad that you've felt this happiness that I feel, and for those of you that haven't yet experienced something like this, I hope that you find it soon. 

Have a safe journey. "	t5_2qh7l	True

1365865619.0	1c9rjy	The Holy Grail of Bizarrely Psychoactive, Accidental Psychotropics: Amfonelic Acid	probablytoomuch	633	111	170	"Hey guys!

I spend an enormous amount of my time exploring gray-market novel drugs that were either created and then forgotten or synthesized outside the US and subsequently too low key to show up on DEA radars. Some of my favorite include Bromantane, a stimulant that relieves anxiety, PRL-8-53, an experimental nootropic that increased digit span to 22 in studies (up from the human average of 8), and well, a bunch-- but that's not what I wanted to bring to your attention.

Amfonelic acid! Originally discovered when some scientists were investigating new types of antibiotics, it was found soon after be an insanely potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor (many magnitudes stronger than cocaine) WITHOUT *any* affinity for norepinephrine reuptake-- something that is almost unheard of. Damn near every stimulant has affinity for both norepinepherine and dopamine to some extent, leading to the side effects most associated with stimulants- anxiety, stress, racing thoughts, etc. Since amfonelic acid ONLY has affinity for dopamine, it's used in studies of the effects of dopaminergics to figure out how dopamine works in the brain independently of interfering factors of classical amphetamines, as well as to isolate the pharmacological peculiarities of said amphetamines. It has *no* peripheral effects, but it does seem to raise levels of tryptophan and serotonin metabolites to a lesser extent, without affecting serotonin reuptake, leading to the possibility of a novel antidepressant. If you aren't familiar with pharmacology, all this means it is VERY RECREATIONAL. In fact, it's cited in the argument that high dopamine reuptake inhibition and high affinity correlates with high recreational potential and self-administration potential (addictive potential).

Why am I bringing this up? Amfonelic acid has been a gleam in the eye of gray market legal highs for a number of years, but it's very difficult (and expensive!) synthesis has made it prohibitive to widespread use. Recently, however, it was discovered on some legal high websites-- and the CoA looks legit. (For those not familiar, CoA = Certificate of Authenticity, the document verifying legitimate synthesis, read: the product is legit)

As far as I can tell, there isn't much known about it's dangers-- besides it's completely unique method of action, which due to it's nature means we don't know interactions with other drugs and such- but it's VERY! potent, even inhalation while measuring it is enough for a full-on experience, and measuring it itself is almost impossible, because it's theorized to be active as low as the microgram range (like acid). So! If you know anyone seeking this, or buying it, be CAREFUL! There is no plan of action at hospitals and clinics for treating an overdose, and we don't even have standardized dosing practices yet. For all we know, even a benzo might not be able to treat a bad reaction.

I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up in party scenes soon- so do your research, know your shit, and BE CAREFUL!

If you want to read more, here's some of the research done with amfonelic acid at pubmed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=amfonelic+acid). As you can see, it's very popular in research, and you can find out some interesting things about stimulants and dopamine paging through those articles."	t5_2qh7l	True

**Time is ticking...**

Do you want to hear about re-legalization efforts in 2014??  **HELL NO!**  We need to change things come November time 2012!

BUT to even get some of these measures on the ballot, the hard-working people that run these initiatives **need YOUR signatures and donations.**  

""What if my state isn't on the list?"" or ""what if I don't even live in the US?"" *You can still donate a few bucks to one of these organizations!*  For example, the Show-me Cannabis campaign in Missouri pays hard-working signature-gatherers 1 dollar for every signature they get.  It's an incentive to go out and be active in the political process!

How you can help:
1. REGISTER to vote!  Before you can sign a petition, you have to be registered in that state!

2. SIGN a petition.  It's easy!

3. DONATE if you have some spare change!  1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars, whatever; it will go to good people working for a good cause!

4. VOLUNTEER.  If you have some spare time or are curious as to see how the political process works, donate some of your time by collecting signatures!

5. SPREAD the good word!  I'm reaching out to over 50,000 readers!  What will **you** do to help the cause??

If these petitions fail, and you did not sign one, then do not be pissed and wonder why we'll have to wait ANOTHER 2 YEARS to do this same old thing all over again!


tl;dr - **Before we can vote to RE-legalize, we need to sign these petitions before it's too late!**


ps - if we get ALL of these petitions on the ballot, then we can feel like [this](http://community2.metalreview.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.ImageFileViewer/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles.editorials/FYSloth.bmp_2D00_550x0.jpg)"	t5_2qh7l	True
1289012309.0	e1zxu	10 months ago DMT changed me. I can’t change back.	DMTpressed	657	148	349	"I need help, I don’t know what to do now and there aren’t any flesh and blood people I know that I can ask for help; so I’m trying here. I apologize for the length and incoherentness, I tried to get it out as best I could.

Like the title says, I tried DMT nearly a year ago; since then, I haven’t been able to shake this feeling of constant culture-shock. A little background first may help: I live in the hick-town temperance-colony where I was born and raised, it’s one of those places that has never left the safety of the 1950s. The kind of city where drugs are abhorred - except caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and acetaminophen for the grown-ups, and Ritalin and Adderall for the kids. I grew up taking my prescribed instructions on reality from television, Jesus, and colonial myths - never questioning them, but, still never totally immersing myself in the narrative either. The plan was law-school, money, the pride of my parents and extended family, always making sure to stay on the rails of civilisation.

I had a little rebelliousness in me: I quietly stopped believing in God, had a little fornication, enjoyed a bit of the oft maligned marijuana, but, other than that, I’ve been a good boy. One day, I had an opportunity to try this DMT (I won’t go into details, I knew a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy) that I’ve heard so many praises sung of from all corners of the internet. When you’re an ex-evangelical and you hear something lets you experience death and come back, well, curiosity gets the better of you. Now remember, I’m naive in the ways of the psychonaut; cannabis and alcohol are all that have altered my reality until then, and in hindsight it was probably for the best that I didn’t know exactly what to expect. I planned for my evening like I was going to get super, super, super baked: I had my snacks and juice, and a PVR ready to show a National Geographic special on the known Universe. I heated up what is colloquially seen as a “crack-pipe” and, well...

Here’s where words fail, I suppose. Every atom in my body exploded away from my core, although, exploded isn’t the right word... It was blisteringly fast, I was almost instantly scattered evenly across the Universe, but it wasn’t “violent”, it was like chalk-dust rushing away from clapped erasers. What perception was left could “see” everything in an infinitely high resolution, and I plunged through that resolution, “knowing” more the deeper I went. I didn’t feel alone, there were glittering lattice-works of pure celestial creation everywhere, but there wasn’t a sense that we’d comprehend each other. Eventually, “years” later, I came to the Source. That’s the best word I can think of for it. The bottom turtle. But what I “remember” does not coincide with what I “understood”: this Source was simply an infinite, perfectly flat plane that rippled and shimmered on whims; these ripples being what births realities. And that’s all that I can really describe.

When I came back I was baffled and exhausted; I think I was pretty sure I had died and there wasn’t going to be a coming-back, but there I was. I chugged some juice and tried to sleep.

The next few weeks to a month were sparklingly beautiful. Follies and fallacies had been swept away and all was new. Everything that had a shape or a texture, a taste or a smell was gorgeous, and I felt at peace. Birds swirling overhead made my eyes well up and I despaired that I couldn’t share this with the people busy fingering their plastic rectangles. With hell being other people, this feeling wouldn’t last. I started to feel like I couldn’t communicate properly with others, my friends and family; they’d go on about Dancing with the Stars, the activities of Tiger Woods, what kind of new new new car they were going to lease next. I used to be able to participate in this fantasy, I couldn’t anymore, the banality made my head swim and the hopeless emptiness of it filled me with grief. Morally, I knew I couldn’t chase my vestigial tail and bits of paper anymore; animal instinct and arbitrarily constructed value just didn’t mean anything.

I thought I just needed to give it time - I could go back to blaming the poor for their poverty, railing against faceless injustice that made me a victim as I unknowingly victimised others - but I haven’t been able to. I can’t stop caring, I can’t stop seeing the absolutely pointless suffering we cause despite being well within our power to stop. I can’t stop seeing Westerners consuming until it kills them as the rest of the world starves to death. But everyone around me doesn’t want to see, they don’t want to know, so I have no one to talk to.

My question is, what now? I can’t keep living in a concrete wasteland but nearly everyone I know would see my rejection as a monumental betrayal. I don’t want to abandon people, I just want out of the horrible machine they’ve built.

EDIT: Holy crap I've gotten a little more of a response than I anticipated, I want to thank everyone for the advice; I've been feeling like a bit of wandering would do me good, although the only real skill I have is computer repair and that's not really a ""hot"" trade. I didn't realize there were this many people would ""understand"" what I can barely piece together myself. It actually gives me hope."	t5_2qh7l	True

This happened over 10 months. In my mind, I've been rationalizing my usage and something kept me in denial. I always weighed out my dosages (20-30mg) and took multivitamins + zinc and magnesium. I never binged or missed sleep. I look like a normal person and nobody would guess I even used drugs. However, I noticed that my pattern matches what an addict's would look like. 10 months of no real productivity, 10 months of setting off goals and losing hobbies. At first, I took meth to do homework and read books - I was using it purely for studying purposes. One day I decided to dose before hanging out with my friends. I loved it. Meth made me a social god, I had zero problems talking to people - no, felt the NEED to walk up to people, and getting to know them was the most interesting thing in the world. Then I tried it with around my girlfriend. My god, the sex was fucking amazing. FOUR hours. Let's just say she was fucking satisfied. Sober sex was NOTHING compared to meth sex. Being sober was dull compared to life on meth. I tried going out while sober and I was just bored... almost numb compared to what life feels on meth. I kept telling myself this would be my last bag but I spend pretty much every waking moment now spent looking forwards to the next dose. There is no such thing as responsible use with meth; I've taken all the precautions (measuring my doses, taking vitamins, not redosing, eating, taking care of hygiene, sleeping) but I have found myself addicted anyways. The high just feels so amazing. 

How my sober life feels hasn't changed, but it's just that I see what real euphoria feels like and I've realized that being sober... kinda sucks. I never even IV'd or smoked, I can't imagine how they feel. Stay away guys, meth isn't a fucking joke."	t5_2qh7l	True

1320671968.0	m3gve	When in doubt make tea (LSD)	blue_one	601	104	83	"Douglas Adams says, 'When in doubt, make tea'. LSD usually involves a lot of doubt and a lot of tea. Despite the time dilation making a cup of tea is an epic undertaking, allow at least 20 minutes. The first step is to leave the room you are currently in. Making the transition from the couch to the kitchen might seem impossible, but trust me, it can be done, there is a reality outside of this room. Once you get through the door, take a moment to adjust to the new space of the hallway or corridor.  There are a lot of doors here. Don't get lost, you're on a mission. There are a lot of possibilities to be explored, but you have plenty of time for that later. Focus, stick to the plan. 

Hopefully your kitchen isn't a complete disaster zone, and you have at least washed the dinner plates from last night. The tile floor might be wobbling around and the cupboards getting a bit melty. Don't worry, they'll do that. Just don't linger on the food right now, crumbs have a tendency to turn in a swarms of ants, and fruit can get disturbingly biological. 

Making tea involves a couple of steps that you have to do in the right sequence. Thankfully it's pretty hard to make any disastrous mistakes. Fill the water with kettle. No wait, that's not right. Fill the kettle with water. Press the button. Sometime in the future boiling water will be ready, but a lot stuff is going to happen between now and then. Mugs, teabags, milk. Are you making tea for your friends? Yep, they are separate people and physical constraints dictate one cup per person. It is a little sad, but trust me, despite what you're feeling right now, it's the way to go with this tea business.  

If you find yourself getting bored waiting for the kettle, there's a lot of interesting ways you can pass the time. There is the ever present option of closing your eyes and enjoying the in-flight movie. If you listen carefully you'll find that the rhythm of that fan is actually overlaid with a melody. Depending on your choice of wallpaper, repeating patterns can be strangely attractive. You can always turn on the tap and go inside the sink to a sci-fi world of glittering stainless steel. Just try to avoid any packaged food, the flat colours and strong graphic design is inherently distasteful. That sugar box with its corporate slogans is definitely not your friend.

Water's boiling. Hopefully you haven't wandered off and forgotten about the rest of the plan yet. Fill the cups with water, put one teabag in each cup. This is easy, you've been doing it for years. Add the milk. You might get lost watching clouds of milk erupting under the surface of the tea. That's ok, that tea cup can be the moon, the ocean, a commentary about mankind and the circularity of our existence. Eventually you'll have to break the trance, but probably only a couple of seconds have passed. You might want to take some spoons back to your friends while you are in the kitchen. It will be worth it for the distorted liquid reflections and mind bending Matrix references. 

Congratulations, you've made tea and as a reward, you get to enjoy a hot, tasty beverage. Now you just have to get back to the living room...

However, it is a tedious work and progresses more slowly than I first thought. After doing this for some time, I decided to stop for today and continue tomorrow. But I can already give you some fun information I discovered so far:  
  
* Most people use their first drug (excluding tobacco) at 12-14 years old.  
* The average number of drugs tried is 16.  
* Alcohol is by far the first drug most people use. Second comes Cannabis, third is Tobacco.  
* The age at which most people try the most new drugs is 16 to 18.  
* At 18 most people first experience LSD, Mushrooms, MDMA and Cocaine. At 16, the leaders are Cannabis and Alcohol.  
* 16-17 is also the average year for first time Opioid use.  
* Most people don't try DMT until they are 19 or older.  
* A lot of users try Amphetamine at 18-19 years of age, but with Methamphetamine first use is spaced evenly between 15-20 years.  
  
This is all for now, but I still have 500 lists to add, so expect more to come. Oh and of course these numbers were only created at a quick glance, and I in no way claim that they are correct or representative in any way for the real population. Oh and one more thing, if someone  who is good in Excel and creating charts wants to help me interpret these numbers, feel free to send me a PM, as my knowledge in this domain is really limited and I'm learning along the way.

1311617263.0	izdfi	I have shocking information for you to consider. [x-post from r/trees]		679	195	311	"The drug culture is not what it used to be.

Over the last month [our group](http://i.imgur.com/dLyDV.jpg) has tested nearly 2,500 substance samples presented to us by patrons of music festivals and concerts.

The results have been truly sobering.

Nearly 100% of samples are cut with one or more substances, and they aren’t using baking soda anymore.

Research chemicals, sold as “bath salts” or “plant food” have become an alarming issue. Nearly 60% of “Molly” (MDMA powder) samples tested at Wakarusa, Bonnaroo, Electric Forest and Camp Bisco contained large quantities of or were completely comprised of one or more of these chemicals. Many of these ""research chemicals"" present very real overdose fatality risks and have been in news all over the world. There were 8 overdoses attributed to tainted MDMA powder at Camp Bisco. Three of those individuals are no longer with us.

An overwhelming majority of tested LSD samples were negative for the chemical. In the best-case scenario, the sample was just paper. In most instances, the LSD we tested contained compounds such as DO(x), a dark hallucinogen with a three-hour onset (leading to multiple doses) and can last for over 24 hours. Overdose effects include memory loss, irrational and sometimes violent behavior and the possibility of causing harm to oneself. At high doses, analogs of this chemical have the power to change the way the mind works permanently.

What we are doing to help

Testing 

The [Bunk Police](http://i.imgur.com/dLyDV.jpg) deploys an array of chemical reagent tests to identify substances and cutting agents. These tests, although not completely definitive, give us a very good idea what the powder, pill or paper contains. We can test for well over 20 chemical compounds and we are constantly trying to expand our knowledge and capacity to test. The testing equipment that we use at our campsite is the same as Dancesafe.org has been using for over a decade. In addition to these standard tests, we also have the same tests that are used by the State Department, DEA and many EMTs.

Mobile Testing Centers 

In addition to a stationary camp, we equip our volunteers with mobile testing kits and send them into what we call “hotspots” where substance sales are taking place openly. When in these locations, our volunteers simply set up a station right there where the action is taking place. On multiple occasions we were able to inform a dealer that he or she was selling a dangerous product leading to its removal from the market.

Outreach Program 

We are able to identify substances in most cases, however many of the people we deal with are unprepared for the information we’re giving them. In order to deal with this issue, we have compiled comprehensive yet easy to understand reference materials and have volunteers ready to assist in informing our patrons.

Information Sessions 

I personally conduct a brief information session every day of each event on the changing substance market and drug identification. I will cover the methods used to disguise dangerous cutting agents and how to know what you’re taking is real, as pure as possible and safe.
Ents, I come to you weary from battle and in need of advice. Myself and my small group have been working long hours all across the U.S. testing substances and spreading awareness for the last six weeks. We've been raided by the Hell's Angels (security at Camp Bisco) and harassed by the Police and other security forces. In attempting to remove dangerous substances from the market, we've run into some of the most intelligent, kindest people and some of the most twisted, greedy and evil souls that this world holds.

If you believe in our cause, please do what you can to help us with the following dire needs:

1) Legal advice

2) Advice on becoming a nonprofit

3) Help in constructing a website

4) Help in advertising online, at events and anywhere else it might be appropriate (headshops, etc.)

5) Help in manufacturing and shipping test kits

6) Help at events

7) Financial advice, accounting and contributions.

My partner in this operation is heading back home to his family, leaving only myself to continue the crusade. I feel that I am driven enough and more than capable of continuing this, but I must try and appeal to others in order to expand the efforts of this entity I've created. Thank you so very much for your time and consideration.

Love and Light,

Tim

In conversation the other day, I had a friend relate a bad ecstasy experience from several nights earlier. That'll happen with E, and I listened to what she thought was the reason....

&gt; ""I found out later the pill was coke-based""

...I decided to bite my tongue and let her continue

&gt; ""Yeah, I never react well to coke-based pills. The first one I took though was Opium based, and I loved that. Another time I had a heroin-based pill and it was pretty good too""

It scares me that some people are taking pills, or any drug for that matter, being so misinformed about their possible impurities. Even from another friend, a frequent ecstasy user, I've heard remark, ""My pill was mescaline based"". This is true for other random folks I've talked to at parties.

I'd just like to remind new users that Ecstasy pills are not ""based"" on something like this. No drug manufacturer is going to put another, usually more expensive substance (like in the case of coke/heroin), in your pill just to be a dick.

However, Ecstasy pills are frequently impure, with substances like Piperazine, caffeine powder, and other things which will make you feel shitty.

http://www.pillreports.com/ is an excellent website for getting an idea of how adulterated pills are in your area.

If you want to be even safer, I advise buying a Test Kit from somewhere like DanceSafe - http://dancesafe.org/products/testing-kits

1351682546.0	12e69o	Trip report: 25 water drenched tabs of LSD	astreetcarcalled	619	141	321	"So, a few people may have saw me post about it previously, but for those that don't read /r/drugs every day like an obsessed maniac (like me), I basically posted a thread, asking for help after I managed to spill water all over 25 acid tabs I had just bought, and I was fucking distraught. What was I to do? How can I save my LSD? Did I just waste a shitton of money, on a drug that I basically live for, dream about, and obsess with? I fucking HOPE not... anyway, my natural train of thought lead me to asking /r/drugs for help, which is where the aforementioned came from. I HAD previously read about chlorine in water destroying LSD, and I figured if my LSD ain't fucked, it's surely going to degrade some. 

Mainly, the advice from the thread was ""eat it"". At first, I was kind of hesitant, y'know, that's like... 25 tabs of acid, and the most I had ate before was TWO of those very same tabs. My experience with two of those tabs was talking to my wall, asking it to show me the words that looked like they were in another dimension... yeah, basically, shit was pretty trippy, but the bliss and euphoria from the experience was fucking amazing. I mean, I haven't done that much acid before (twice previously, so this was my third time, but the first time was not even acid, NBOME, probably), however, I think that acid that makes me feel like that probably isn't all that common. So, you'd think, going from TWO to fucking TWENTY FIVE might do something. Yeah, it kind of did. 

Basically, I put twenty five of those little suckers in my mouth, I basically consumed them all when they were still attached as a sheet, all soggy and shit, and swallowed it all whole. Now, from this point on, I have no idea how much time passed, how long it took to kick in, how long it lasted, or when I even took them. I didn't black out or anything, I just had no semblance of time, so I'll go ahead and describe experiences that occured and how I felt.

I had intense euphoria, more than I've ever felt. When I was on two tabs, I had these kind twitches, but it was amazingly pleasureable, like an orgasm, I don't know, but yeah, this was amplified greatly. This... I think was on the come up, I actually kind of remember the time of this bit, because this was before the peak blew my brain up. The world was fractals, language didn't make sense, it was just shapes and colours, and it was all so pretty. After a short while of this, feeling like I was in the light of some God, I think I experienced what most people call ego death, but I don't know, because it was is an experience that cannot be described by words, but basically, I lost all sense of being, I was nothing, and there was no ""I"". It felt like everything had died, just shrunk and became nothing. I figure this would have been terrifying were the euphoria not still there. There wasnt't so much terror as there was awe at this experience, I couldn't hold my mouth agape in awe, because I wasn't attached to my body anymore, because there was no body, it was just felt.

I stayed inside during this entire experience, and I'm sure as fuck glad I did, given I lost pretty much all body functions, comprehension of language, and I have no idea what would have happened if this was in an environment where I wasn't comfortable. As I said, for the most part, I lost semblance of being, where I was, but there was a great comfort in the feeling of being ""home"" and being in a safe place. However, even though I've been painting this all in a very bright light, with everything being positive about it, I think this was probably rare. 

I've heard of a lot of people that blow off psychadelics, and pretend that they know them, that they understand them and control them, but that's never true. What I experienced was a mind blowing, and life changing experience, where I even question the existance of a God where I was previously very firmly atheist. I've tried my best to put my experience into words, but what I experienced cannot be captured by language, and I know that sounds like hippy pretentious bullshit, but that's just the way things are.

Yeah.

If anyone has any questions regarding the experience, I'll try my best to answer. Again, though, apologies for the scatterbrained post."	t5_2qh7l	True

The first time, his daughter (a little younger than 2 years old) found him. I picked her up and brought her over to my place. Over the next 4 or 5 hours she was with me, she kept saying ""My daddy didn't wake up. I tried to talk to him, and he wouldn't wake up."" I'm normally really cold and emotionless, but this fucking broke me. I hadn't cried in years about anything, and I had to leave the room every time she said it to sob uncontrollably. After composing myself, I would go back out and color with her and take her out to the swimming pool for as long as I could hold the tears back. 

I took my brother out to eat a day or two after that, so I could talk to him about it. He gave all the usual excuses about how it's not a big deal or whatever. As we were walking out, I said something about it again. When he refused to admit it was a problem, I looked him straight in the face and calmly said, ""Don't give me that shit, dude. I don't ever want to hear your daughter say 'my daddy wouldn't wake up' ever the fuck again."" He broke down too, and said ""You're right.""

He immediately started doing better. He's prescribed the pain pills for his back injury, but he was actually taking fewer than he was supposed to. I was proud, and I let him know it. Two months ago, his dad died in the hospital due to multiple organ failure from decades of alcoholism and drug abuse. We went up there to see him before he died, but he was unconscious the whole timer. Despite his dad being kind of a deadbeat asshole, my brother didn't take it very well. He wanted to act like he didn't care, but it was obviously hurting him. He started over-medicating again afterward.

He came over two days ago asking if I knew anyone who needed some pain pills, so I bought all of them he was trying to get rid of. I threw them all away. I could tell that he really just needed the money, and I felt like it would be better for me to just buy his pills so he wouldn't be taking as many. He still ended up taking too many last night. 

Now he is lying in a hospital bed with a machine breathing for him. They did some kind of scan on him and it shows serious damage in the part of his brain that controls motor function. They think he will come out of the coma, but there's no way of knowing for sure. His daughter is staying with me for the moment, and I knew she would say the same thing as before. I still couldn't handle it when she said it. It hurt me even fucking more than it did last time, because I feel that I may be the only male role model she has one day. You know what, though? It would probably be better that way.

You can sit here and say ""Wow, that sucks; I'm glad I'm not like that,"" but I know some of you are lying to yourselves. Everyone thinks they are in control of their shit until it all falls down. But then, it's too late. 

If you think you might be fucking up, even a little bit, you are probably fucking up more than you realize. Keep your shit together. Don't let it ruin your life."	t5_2qh7l	True

Here is my story, please read this, for everyones sake.	Orangesnapple	650	182	370	" **First off, let me say that this Redditor is still on here, posting everyday, pretending like this didn't even fucking happen. Also, I know everything that happened to me is partially my fault.** Trusting someone from a certain subreddit and disobeying Reddit policy was a stupid thing to do; and being naive didn't help too much either. Oh and one more thing, sorry it's so long but, this is a long story, I thought I should tell it in its entirety.

***Her Reddit name is /u/MeowKitty420...I know her real name and address as well, but what the hell am I gonna do about it? Tell her mommy and daddy?

 Anyhow, like I said, this is just a warning for anyone reading, you don't have to abide by it. So, a couple months ago I'm on a subreddit and come across a link asking where people live. I state where I'm from and come across a couple friendly redditors who live in my area. One, a girl (who even sent me a picture with her name and etc, so I'd know it was her) says that she gets scripts and has them all the time etc, and could get them for cheap. She tells me where exactly in my state she's from and I'm kind of put off by the 2 hour drive difference, so I put off seeing her for awhile. As time goes by we start talking more, eventually exchange numbers and begin texting every day. We talk about anything and everything, about how she got beat and how she would never be able to do that to someone nor ever has. I start to think she's a decent enough person and maybe I should give her a chance. Well, more time goes by and finally I get a string of texts from her. She says her father (probably a good guy for all I know, I don't think he had part in his daughters actions) has gotten a script from his doctor but he cannot afford to pay for it. She tells me if I throw up a couple bills she will give me a great deal (an amount that I couldn't pass up, but wasn't so exuberant that I wouldn't think she was fucking with me). I ask her why her friends haven't given her money or why she didn't just throw up some to get it for herself. She replies with thousands of compelling excuses; she didn't have the money and neither did any of her friends, she was worried about w/d and her dads pain, etc.

 So after a couple more days she coaxes me into meeting up with her. I drive two hours to meet her at a convenience store near her house and give her the money. I asked her for something for collateral, jewelry, an ipad, something physical to hold onto so I knew she would come back. She says she ""doesn't have any jewelry and wont give me her ipad cause it's more expensive than the amount I'm giving her"". So she offers me her fucking bong, so of course I don't want to be waiting for her with paraphernalia so I just ask for her home address. She gives it to me and I hand her the money. She then tells me she's going to the pharmacy now and she'll be back in ten minutes; I was to wait in a near buy parking lot. So as I wait I text her to see what's up and eventually 4 hours go buy and she keeps saying ""the pharmacy wont give her dad the script until they check with his insurance"". It eventually gets late and she tells me to go home, she'll come by my place in the morning when she gets it and not to worry. I, stupidly, believe her and go home and wait.

  The next day I text her, asking if she got the script filled and when she would be there. She said she had gotten it filled and proceeded to tell me a place near my home where we could meet. The time comes and I go to meet her, of course she is nowhere to be found. An hour goes by in which there is pointless back and forth texting where she keeps saying she'll be there in ten minutes. Eventually I start to get upset about waiting and at that exact time she just so happens to tell me a cop pulled her over (because she was speeding to meet me...YEA OKAY) and she tossed the drugs and is now heading back home. She pleads and promises that she'll have them for me tomorrow, but I'll have to meet closer to her this time. So the next day my brother (he put up some of the dough) and I go for an hour drive to meet her at this random mall that's halfway between each of our homes. Hours go by with her constantly repeating ""I'll be there really soon""(sound familiar?); my brother and I are really fed up by this point and begin to call her out on her shadiness. She responds with hostility, saying ""I'm fucking coming, do you want this shit or not, I don't have to do this for you, I could just fuck you over!"". Anyhow, another two hours go by and I get a text from her telling me she's incredibly sorry and busy with her father. Then tells me that we should go home and ONCE AGAIN says she would come to me later that night when she was ready. My brother and I wait all night, she never shows or even texts us back. By this point we're absolutely positive she's fucked us.

  Eventually, a couple days later, she tells me she's going to come to my house and drop them off....again. She tells me she's with her brother in the city (less than 15 mins away from me) and she'll drop off the stuff in my mailbox. I find this incredibly skeptical and ask her how she'll know which mailbox is mine. She says she has a gps and that I should put a bag on top of my mailbox, just in case she has trouble finding it. I text her, asking if she's dropped it off. She says yes (why didn't she fucking text me?), so I go outside to my mailbox and check.......what do you know? NOTHING IS THERE. She claimed that she put the pills in a plastic bag, hanging on my mailbox flag. I searched that thing and the surrounding area pretty damn thoroughly and nothing, I mean NOTHING, was inside/fell out of the bag. I begin to get a bit heated now and say some nasty things. She responds furiously, like it's my fault that she'll come by again but I wont be getting as much this time. I angrily comply, even though I know none of this is my fault and she's a fucking liar. She never comes by, stops answering my texts and basically disappears for awhile. Then, one night I feel a buzzing in my pocket. It's her. She says she's really sorry, she's in the area and she just wants to make things right. Well I wait up all night and once again, I text her a couple of times and hear nothing back. This was the last time we spoke, and that was months ago. 

   *****edit Once she saw the first version of this post, she hit me up and promised to have them to me by monday at 6pm (after she was ""done work""). She told me what she feels so bad for what she did and she wants to make it right. Crying, telling me her story of woe, saying she owed some ""tough mexican guy"" money and what she did was so wrong. In a confessing tone, though probably lying, she says she really did have them the second time but her friend changed their mind about fronting her. Anyway, Monday rolls around and of course no text, eventually she says she didn't get it right the first time and it was supposed to be wednesday. Well, to say the least, she never came through, as expected. She called crying, yet again, saying ""I had to work my friends shift and couldn't make it tonight but I'm going to come through I swear""; after which I pretty much told her to fuck off. So she says ""you don't want them then?? Just drive down her I swear I'll give them to you, meet me half way"". I just hung up and told her to pretty much fuck off. Either she must get off on lying or just can't bring her self to come out of shame because she tries so hard at it. She must of said ""I'm coming and I feel so bad about what happened before, I just want to make things right"" about a thousand times. There's something wrong with this young woman and I hope she gets the help she needs before she fucks with the wrong person or something much worse.

 So Reddit, I leave it to you to read this and take into account how horrible some people can really be. I know it was stupid of me to believe her in the first place but she keeps trying to lie to me and say she's going to make things right.

The fact that she took my good nature for granted so many times just really makes me think how lost some people really can be. I am a strong believer in Karma and I know (and even hope, as horrible as that sounds) that some day she'll get hers for this
If you want to know more information about her or what happened, feel free to PM me.


**This is in no way Reddits fault, I just want to make that clear. Some of you took offense to that, like I was trying to insult the community but it couldn't be further from the truth. Reddit is full of awesome people, just be weary of who you choose to meet up with is all I'm trying to convey.**

**UPDATE I just want to say thank you to everyone who got this to the front page. The community here is incredible and I really appreciate the help. I'm almost positive she's going to see this post now, if she hasn't already; and that's all because of you guys!**

I'm 33, have done a little of everything, and really really enjoy Adderall. I thought meth would be like Adderall, and in a sense it was, but with a much worse aftermath. The experience itself was fine: felt good, lots of energy and focus. I don't play golf, but I went to a driving range and cranked away for hours. It was fun. 

But what scares me is what happened the next day. First of all, despite taking Xanax, I couldn't sleep. Then I spent the entire next day depressed. Everything seemed hopeless. I kept telling myself that it's just because of dopamine or whatever, but it still felt real. Everything I had been looking forward to seemed scary and pointless. I didn't want to leave my house and see anybody. I kept thinking about how I could cancel everything I had planned that week, like a date, a softball game, and various business appointments. I just felt hopeless. 

So for me, the fun I had on meth is not worth the after effects. I'm much happier with Adderall, which doesn't leave me depressed at all. Anyone else have similar experiences?"	t5_2qh7l	True

I tripped with my friends and I felt little connection with them and couldn't help but to feel I wasn't wanted. My relationship with them is dying and I don't know what I can do to reverse that. I could feel that we all saw the pink elephant in the room, that all we do together is smoke weed or other drugs, and that I don't really have anything in common with them anymore, but none of us really acknowledged that in full.

We spent the entire experience engaging in silly bullshit banter, shit like ""OMG I'm totally tripping balls"" or variations of that. Whenever I spoke I felt like I cut their vibe with a dagger with my worrying and constant need for validation (which I realized is the only way I'd feel ""good""). All interaction felt forced and orchestrated. I'd laugh at a joke because I was supposed to laugh, not because I found it funny. What is ""funny"" anyways? I laugh because everyone else is laughing, I don't know why, but I want to fit in. This is why my last few trips with people were so negative. 

I left this trip not knowing who I am. I realized that this person is not really someone you would want to hang around with, especially on potent hallucinogens. I don't feel. My personality is whatever is cool at the moment. My views are other people's views. I don't really know *who* is liking all of these things. I've become so disconnected from reality that I just act. No feelings, just acting until I die. Acid made me realize that I don't really want to die, but I don't really know what to do with my life either. The problem is me, but I don't know who that is. 

I'd love to elaborate more but I can't really organize my thoughts that well right now. I just thought I'd type this out while the experience is fresh in my head.

1351506766.0	129oy3	Could be interesting. Alcohol from a non drinker point of view.	ikkake	579	129	235	"So here is an interesting twist for you. I was drunk once in my life, when I was 13, I puked my guts out and it was so traumatic for me I wouldn't get into it at all, I always said ""I like the taste, I hate the state"". You could say I started of a really really bad trip :)
Probably that's why I tried a lot of other drugs, atleast once, always researching, always properly. But not alcohol, even when I was a bartender.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago, after 17 years, I finally let it go. I was in a fantastic company and in great places, I really had a lot of fun, it was perfect setting. The high was very weird, I would say it was as sharp as LSD can be, but much clearer. I though't I'm really really focused and not really drunk as I would expect it, alcohol always gave me impression that it makes you slobby and slow, but no it was opposite of that. Probably the scariest thing about it though is - I'm quite confident person, worked hard on getting rid of anxiety as a dominant feeling all my life, so I'm pretty brave when sober, always putting myself in adrenaline releasing situations, always safe and researching - but dear god alcohol makes you stupid! I had no breaks at all, I felt invincible. This is not a substance that should be mixed with stupid at all. And it explained so much to me. Well I had a great night, I dominated the dance floor and was chatted up, or chatted up myself probably everyone in the club we ended up at. It was much more social and powerfull than MDMA is for me as on MDMA I'm not as social as average user, I just want to watch pretty lights and stay in this beautiful place I am in, and preferably everyone can fuck off unless you want to touch me.

And then we went back home, and I had a fight with my best friend. We argue a lot, it's a weird dynamic, it's usually as we both let the steam out like that, then we hug and move on with our day. But arguing on alcohol is soooooooo... intense, I had no control over my emotions at all, and they felt.... goood! It's really scary and if I'm anything like the average person giving people free access to this drug is the stupidest thing ever. It actually makes agression and rage feel good. No other drug ever made me feel like that, and it scared the shit out of me the next day. 

Plus it has the most terrible come down of anything I ever tried. I actually prefer amphetamine come downs to this because I can smoke weed and feel fine, with alcohol I still feel dry, weak, and out of any energy. Considering I'm pretty fit, I haven't felt that weak and hopeless for a very very long time.

To summarise, alcohol has a pretty decent high compared to other drugs I took, and is incredibly social, but the risk and reducing emotion management, plus very very hard come down make's it totally not worth it and makes me think why the hell people do this to themselves. I would say MDMA is far better alternative for the same type of social drug, atleast it's very simliar, and if you are carefull with it and doing it only sporadically there are no side effects at all, emotional issues are on the other side of the spectrum and it feels so much better.

2 out of 5 stars.

edit: After a lot of interesting posts and conversations I am rising the score to 4 out 5 stars, as that's what I would give it if the comedown wasn't as painful and lack of emotional control as scary. But both were my personal mistakes or issues and I cannot blame alcohol for that.

I think the most common opinion is that it was the caffeine from red bulls and coke that pretty much made me dehydrated really hard even if I was drinking water. I will attempt this again next weekend just more smart this time, only pure spirits, most likely a lot of god fathers and old fashioned as I love those. Maybe good scotch with soda."	t5_2qh7l	True

I wasn't with my friend when he died, and I'm only assuming if he was with someone they were also so fucked up that they couldn't do a damn thing about it.

I just think it's necessary, as I'm thinking about losing another friend to this drug, that people understand the special risk associated with opiates. Yes, they feel abso-fucking-lutely amazing, and therein lies one big risk. We all know heroin is easily one of the most addictive drugs out there, so I won't say much else about that.

I think I just wanna let people know that these drugs are fucking strong, and they're strong for a reason. People should exercise extreme caution when doing opiates, intravenously or otherwise. You can do too much no matter the pathway, and it will kill you. 

Always stay hydrated. This is important with ALL drugs (and life itself), including alcohol and marijuana (helps with cottonmouth). Know your limits and pay attention to your dose. If you don't have a mg scale, get one. Be prepared for something to go wrong and, if you can, have a babysitter with you. Know your dealer, etc.

______________________________________________________________________

Hi everyone,

My best friend of 25 years, Chris, died of a heroin overdose on the weekend. He was 31. He was alone, and he took too fucking much and he's gone. It seems like there's at least one post like this a week, but all the cliches that are easy to brush off come into sharp, sharp relief when the shit hits the fan. 

Everyone says the same thing when something like this happens, but *please, please, please* be careful and be safe. Chris said the same fucking thing to me and all of our friends last year when he found his roommate dead of a cocaine overdose. It was a huge head-check, and he personally implored certain friends who are/were hitting the coke too hard to *be careful and be safe*. We're not invincible and we never were. Now the goddamn guy who never left my side since we were 7 years old is a fucking corpse for the *SAME FUCKING REASONS*. 

I don't do any drugs beyond weed and booze these days, as I've got a little family to raise, but I've tried almost everything that came my way back in the day except for heroin (long story, but scattered opiates I'd tried had made me feel really sick, and there's a family history with heroin). 

Anyway, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was to tell my little 8-year-old daughter that her godfather had died. When she eventually asked me how it happened, I looked at my wife, shrugged my shoulders and just told her, ""Uncle Chris took too much of a bad drug. It was an accident. Drugs themselves aren't good or bad, and doing a drug doesn't make someone a good or bad person. It's about the choices we make. A lot of people, most people perhaps, take some sort of drug almost every day...coffee, beer, cigarettes, Tylenol, whatever. I can drink 2 or 3 pints of beer, and it makes me relaxed and talkative. If I drank 8 or 9 beers, I'd be falling over and I'd get sick.""

She grasped the concept of drugs and addiction immediately, in a way that went far beyond her years. I wanted to frame the topic in the right way, in the sense that I don't want to turn a blind eye to drugs and pretend they don't exist, nor do I want to use scare tactics and imply that every drug is bad and will kill you. She really understood, and in retrospect I'm really glad I was able to say those things to her, because it won't be very long before she's offered a cigarette, a beer, a joint, whatever. And I want her to have a real, meaningful and fucking informed approach to it. 

Which brings me to you guys and /r/drugs itself. This community is absolutely incredible, educational, informative, and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if it has helped save lives at some point. When Chris and I were growing up and started to get into drinking booze and smoking pot, around the age of 17, resources like this simply did not exist. Neither of us even had regular access to the internet, which itself was in its relative infancy at the time. Thus, we approached drugs with a fairly casual, loose attitude. The idea of having a testkit, measuring doses, doing any research into any given drug just never crossed our minds. We found Erowid just after high school, as I recall, and I remember doing a bit of research here and there, but again, even when we started trying harder things like ecstasy and coke, we just popped the pill, did the line, no questions asked...

So I'd like to thank all of you for the direct and honest communication that this subreddit provides, and thank you to the moderators, particularly Borax, whom I haven't had any real exchanges with, but I've seen your comments and posts and they are always smart, simply stated and eloquent.

If you've read all of this, thank you for listening. Please be safe. It's better to underdose and not be as high as you'd like than to overdose and be a goddamn corpse. 

I'm sorry this is such a fucking bummer of a post, but thank you for listening.

**TL;DR** Read it or don't read it, I'm just getting my thoughts out.

1357106128.0	15t937	When to call 911/go to the ER	thirdrail69	516	84	133	"There's a disturbing post below, the outcome of which is unknown. Someone came here to ask what they should do about their friend that is pissing and puking blood.

On that note, here are symptoms that require you to immediately seek medical attention:

*Blood coming from any orifice except a mild nosebleed. This includes vomit, piss, shit, from the ears or coughing it up.

*Blue or grey skin or lips

*Shallow, raspy, rapid short breathing or obstructed airway

*Very rapid (160+bpm) heart rate longer than 20 mins. Also irregular heartbeat. Both present requires immediate attention.

*Fibrillating heart - This means that the heart is just shaking, not beating. No pulse present but a hand over the heart will detect an extremely rapid fluttering.

*Droopiness on one side of the body/one pupil larger than the other. This indicates a stroke.

*EDIT High and rapidly climbing fever/rapidly fluctuating temperature, especially on MDMA. Note: Always use an alcohol or mercury thermometer. Digital thermometers with low batteries will give inaccurate and wildly differing readings.

*Sudden loss of consciousness

*Seizures

*Chest pains, especially shooting pains. Shooting pain in the left arm and or tingling.

*Intense or long lasting kidney pain (make sure it's not from sitting uncomfortably without proper lower back support)

*EDIT Numbness/loss of sensation in extremities (limbs/digits). Sitting or laying on your arm or leg will cause this but sensation will return.

*EDIT A few tips courtesy of /u/digitalp2, a Health and Safety officer and bar/festival worker: 

&gt;Vision Loss + Delirium, big sign of someone failing to regulate their water intake.
A note for seizures, Do not restrain/hold down the victim under any circumstances, do not place anything in their airway, even to help them breathe

&gt;A bit of a no brainer, but loss of sensation is perfectly normal on Ketamine and does not require the emergency services!

&gt;A bit of a rare one but Dystonia (It looks exactly like a fit but the victim is conscious and does not involve rapid convulsions, the victim muscles will contract and lock in a strange position, it will cause them extreme distress but usually will be over in a few minutes), it can cause through cutting agents primarily but i've seen it a few times, you need to get an ER while having someone reassure the victim they will be OK.

This is not an exhaustive list and if anyone can think of more I'll add them in.

If/when you do seek medical attention, TELL THE OPERATOR OR PARAMEDICS EVERY DRUG THAT WAS INGESTED. This includes any prescription medication or any drugs taken the previous day OR AYAHUASCA IN THE LAST WEEK. Ayahuasca contains MAOIs and this should be brought to the attention of MHPs immediately.

1370581321.0	1fueqb	Methamphetamine - My understanding so far	clockworkworks	518	94	147	"When I was in my teens and alcohol wasn't really cutting it anymore, I decided it was time to go against everything I was every told and dive into the world of illicit substances. One thing I used to do was read peoples experiences or thoughts and it helped me judge wether it was my cup of tea or not. The purpose of this blurb is to give MY understanding of, in this case, Methamphetamine from a users point of view. I've been taking the ""usual"" club drug suspects for about 12 years, everything bar ""Meth"". 

3 months ago we were after some go-ey but to no avail, however, we could get a half of  G of ""ice"" instead, we got it and collected a glass flume from a dodgy shop across town. I obviously had heard about its dangers, but never really bothered with it as I was content with our usual supply. Anyway, We lit the bowl, felt the hit laughed and continued chugging for most the night (surprisingly). 

To be fair, I didn't even think it was as hardcore as I imagined, felt just like normal whizz. However, a few weeks later I had had a hard day at work also hungover from the night before. We were going to a gig uptown but i was clearly not in the mood, my friend told me he got some more of ""the stuff"". I imagined nothing could liven me up at that stage, I blazed the bowl and took the hit........THIS was the exact moment I knew the true power of this stuff, I was back to normal.. 3 meals, 8 hours sleep in a few puffs. So, this is where I learnt that people who underrate it have not been in the situation in where it throws a hook in your brain, and lays a constant reminder that this mother fucker means business. 

Methamphetamine is a sneaky piece of shit, over the following months it had popped up in replace of other supplies, making its mark. It got to the point where we always had to have it among us when we were on a night in the town. 

Me and my GF found that we were both ten times funnier when we were on it, so we started getting the odd baggy now and again in the weekends. Not a bottle of wine, something civil. It was always recreational, we have good jobs and we know to keep it separate.  It was about two weeks ago that I realized we always had a stash in the house now at all times. How has this happened? It was only supposed to be a one off purchase for a rave. My GF admitted she had sometimes snook a few puffs before the cleaning, and thinking about it I had also snook a few tokes now and again. It was only until today, right now, that i realized this dirty drug has snook up and got me as i had skipped a friends birthday party to get high and surf Reddit. 

The point to this is that, if you fuck around with Meth, it will get you sooner or later. It sneaks into your life under your nose and becomes another necessity you need to keep topped up. Scary thing is you dont know its happening, it'll find a similarity and use that as a hook on you. Money wont matter, I moaned at a 120 food bill, but dont blink an eye paying 350 for a stash. It tricks your mind and it will fuck you over. 

Beware

So what now? not entirely sure, however, I smashed the glass pipe with the back of an axe earlier. So I guess thats a start. I have no hobbies and don't really know what I could do to be proactive. I really enjoyed writing this at the time, maybe ill look into doing something similar, I really dont know. All i know is its time to drop the anchor before I hit the falls, and get the fuck of this boat!

I've been using DMT for a long time now. It's fantastic stuff. Blows all the other designer drugs out of the water. This is by no means a deterrent to experiencing this amazing chemical. It's simply a word of caution. Yes. I'm probably very foolish for repetitive use. Yes, I should have given myself time to recover. All irrelevant points.

I finished playing Diablo 3 for the night. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and laid down to what would become my tomb of inexplicable horror for the next Five hundred billion years (Time is pretty fucked up on this drug, work with me here).

Loaded my pipe, took several lung bursting inhales, and laid back to what I assumed would be a blast off ride to the stars. No such luck.

Let's pause. I love DMT. It's my favorite thing ever. The body high is unrivaled. The visuals are astounding. The sense of wonder and sheer size is gaflounding (yes, I made up a word. It's awesome. Deal with it.) I recommend this drug highly. I shout its praises from mountaintops of gold drizzled in thick milk chocolate.... While tripping. 

Yeah, it's that good. 

So of course, I overindulge occasionally. I acquired a gram recently. I was excited. I've broken through every night since. You can see where this story is starting to take an obvious downturn.

Back to the horror;

My blanket was a screaming banshee of absolute horror and dispair. My charming little bedside light became a judge of unfathomable power within a court of terrifying injustice. My whole being was disassembled and brou-

Ok. You get the picture.

In summary. DMT is the fucking tits. The best tits you've ever seen multiplied by a factor of infinity. But don't disrespect it. Don't be a fool.

I've seen all the horrors eternity can offer. And somehow, I'm glad. How can I fear the cute girl at the bar when I've been emotionally throttled by the force of a thousand dying suns? How can I stand in awkward dissolution at a party? How can I function on the level of true ""sanity"" this society has to offer when fear has been virtually eliminated from my vocabulary?

I can't. I fucking can't. And it feels amazing.

I have a hard-on for life that a lumberjack couldn't slice, and I'm on my way to fuck the world like the silly whore she is.

Careful out there guys.

**TL;DR** Just fucking read it.

Edit: Wow, you guys are fast. Let me have a smoke and I'll get to some replies.

EDIT 2: More in depth descriptive of the trip:

I took three hits and held my breath as long as I could, then wrapped myself in a blanket and closed my eyes. Things were immediately off. The normal experience is a warm embrace and a feeling of massive overwhelming euphoria. Then I usually feel like there's something there speaking to me in a tongue I can't understand but I can appreciate.

This time, no euphoria. No warm embrace. Kind of like having surgery without being put under. You know something's wrong but you can't speak to tell the doctor not to cut in. You feel all the worst parts of the trip tenfold. The imagery that is normally wildly exotic and friendly still looks the same, but without the euphoria and warm embrace you start to view it as horrifying and morbidly wrong.

Then I opened my eyes to abort mission. My whole room was speaking to me. You know how when you're on shrooms the room ""breathes"" a bit and colors are sharper? Not like that at ALL. Inanimate object danced around me and shouted wisdom of a thousand years in my ears. When I said my blanket was a banshee, I wasn't being metaphorical. It sat on one half of my face for the whole trip and screamed the horrors of a hundred generations into my ears.

I can't recall too much more after that. Just a calm resignation in the midst of the horror that I was able to maintain due to my long standing relationship with the drug."	t5_2qh7l	True

1365005192.0	1blesm	One year of stimulants in college. My thoughts and advice...		498	78	165	"I am 20 now and am studying Chemistry (BS) in college. Over the last summer I obtained a script for amphetamines which I have successfully been using to raise my grades. I believe that I do have some degree of ADHD, however I really don't care because the end result is the same. I definitely have RLS. Anyways, here are my thoughts on prescription stimulants after one year. I am writting this list for anyone who is choosing to start taking stimulants on a regular basis for academic reasons. Some of these things are opinions and may not necessary apply to anyone but myself, however there will be a lot of generalization in this list.


1. Adderall is addictive, even for people who legitimately have ADHD and have used their meds since they were young children. I am not in that category, but have never met anyone who didn't admit this.

2. Most doctors that i've seen do not believe people who have ADHD are even capable of getting high from their meds. This leads to somewhat reckless prescribing of stims.

3. The most amphetamine the average person can take in a sustainable manner is around 50mg. Note: ""the average person"". Your mileage may vary.

4. If you are taking amphetamines you would probably be better off with total abstinence from caffeine and tobacco. I get a lot more out of my script by doing this, have much softer comedowns, feel happier and healthier, and get much better quality of sleep.

5. All the amphetamine in the world doesn't mean jack shit if you don't get at least 6 hours of sleep and 2 solid meals per day. Minimum. You'll feel better the more sleep and food you get. I try to get a solid 8 or 9 hours of sleep and munch all day.

6. Don't pull all nighters, they will break your body down, cause your tolerance to skyrocket, and in general fuck shit up.

7. Amphetamines will, at first, make you actually want to do things that you consider work. This will go away after a while, but not entirely. Do not try to compensate by upping the dose. Doing so will just make the problem worse. Instead, you're just gonna have to learn to do shit that you don't want to.

8. If you have trouble sleeping, see your doctor and get that shit solved right away. I use clonidine and melatonin, and it works alright for me. I am thinking of asking for gabapentin as an additional med.

9. You won't always feel like eating but you have to. A good way to get your calories when you don't feel like eating is by drinking whole milk and eating cliff bars. Beef jerky, pasta, omelets, juice, shakes, and gatorade are good ways to get calories as well.

10. Take whatever vitamins you feel is appropriate, just don't go overboard with dozens of obscure nootropics. Take at least a normal multi-vitamin, it'll reduce comedowns and stress. I take one multivitamin, one vitamin C tab, one Omega-3 supplement, and two iron supplements in the morning (I have low blood-iron). I take melatonin and magnesium before bed (both help a tad with sleep).

11. Stimulants can make switching between tasks very difficult. It will always be ""one more second/game/flashcard/whatever"". Learn how to watch out for this and always think ""what am I doing right now, and should I still be doing this or should I be starting something else"".

12. If you cannot moderate yourself with your own meds, see if a trustworthy close friend or SO can distribute your meds to you. Thats what I do. My girlfriend gives me one pill every morning. If I have a packed day, then we discuss two but she has veto power.

13. This one is an opinion, but I find vyvanse to be very much superior to adderall or adderall XR. The come-up is much smoother which I find substantially less addictive. It can't be snorted crushed, plugged or even IV'd for a faster experience. It is what it is and you just have to accept it. Less of a rush also means you don't do as many things you regret in manic euphoria. Then, vyvanse also lasts all day without the up/down bipolar feeling of adderall, and it ends with a much milder comedown. The fact that vyvanse only uses dextroamphetamine as opposed to levoamphetamine supposedly means more dopamine is released compared to epinephrine and norepinephrine. I believe this reduces the stressed out feelings I get from adderall. Finally, less people ask you for vyvanse yet it is worth much more.

14. Stay hydrate. Try to use water fountains.

15. Stimulants can take away the ""gross, I haven't showered or brushed my teeth feeling"". As gross as it is you may have to remind yourself to take care of you hygiene.

16. Try not to mix booze with stims. It will fuck with your head if you do it to much and/or too hard.

17. Do not take stimulants everyday for an unending period. I personally need at least one day off per week to recharge, catch up on sleep and food, and to just relax. Not taking days off reduces the effectiveness of stims and leads to anxiety.

18. To elaborate about the consequences of not getting enough sleep... with enough stimulants you would be hard pressed to feel tired or miss class. You can make yourself feel fine even when you have only a couple hours of sleep per night. You won't notice until afterwards, when you are getting enough sleep, that you have little to no memory or recall of this sleep-deprived state. In that state you become irritable and have wild mood swings. You become OBSESSED with things that you give zero fucks about normally. I mean fucking obsessed researching stupid shit you truly, truly don't care about, and then you barely even remember what you learned during your obsession. Stay the fuck away from this place, it takes a toll on your body, mind, and relationships and it is why my girlfriend now distributes my meds to me.

19. Smoking on amphetamines causes synergistic addiction to both cigs and amps. Try to stay away from here.

20. On the flip side, amps make quitting cigs much easier. It feels like it accelerates the timeline for withdrawal. One week of no cigs on amps feels like one month without amps. However, amps also boost the cravings for cigs during withdrawl.

21. It is very easy to make mistakes like spending all your time making flashcards and no time learning the flashcards.

22. Smoking too much weed with amps can hurt (maybe damage) your heart. Pay attention to it while blazing on stims.

23. More sleeping advice on stims. Eat a big meal before bed, have a fan for white noise, keep the room cold, get a wide bed so you can stretch and not wake up you SO, try to do pushups/situps/run/ect around 6pm, keep the room dark, try melatonin - it helps a little, keep hydrated and well fed, and finally try taking a shower if you can't sleep. Start out with a cool shower, and then gradually make it colder and colder one turn at a time until you feel numb and the water doesn't feel cold anymore. Then switch to warm and slowly make it hotter and hotter until it burns. Switch back and forth between hot and cold and after a while it becomes hypnotic and you get very sleepy. Then get a big glass of milk and go back to bed.

22. In a pinch, 25mg of diphenhydramine can put you to bed. But, this can only be done occasionally because tolerance builds very fast.


Thats all I can think of for now folks, I'll add more if I can think of anything else.

I was not an addict, and, although I was wasteful and would take higher doses than I needed on a regular basis, I had the habit under control for the most part. Now, since dealing with near crippling depression and panic attacks from hell with no medication for 3 months, my view of drugs has changed drastically. I see them as actual medicine for my mental shortcomings. 

While I can't trust myself 100% to not screw up with dosages from time to time, now I see pills as precious supplies to be rationed carefully.  When/if I'm able to get pills again, it's going to be all about moderation.

We told J about our concerns with him tripping with us, and while he was pretty pissed/dissapointed, he offered to be a trip sitter for us. We figured why not and said alright. The friends whos house we were tripping at had some vodka left over, and we offered J a shot or two to calm him down. Bad idea. At the same time we dropped, he drank about 400ml of vodka in like 30 minutes. And keep in mind,J is about 120 pounds, so he's a super lightweight.

Long story short, our entire trip was spent babysitting a belligerent J as he kept saying weird shit to try to freak us out. Luckily the tabs weren't super strong so we were able to handle it. I wish I had lIstened to you guys and excluded him completely. It essentially ruined our first trip having to make sure J didn't break anything for our entire peak.

I had a death wish that shrooms cured. In high school and all of college I was goth. I wore nothing but black for about a decade (actually I'm wearing all black as I write this) I was also obsessed with death. I found the concept fascinating and the act very desirable. I found joy and happiness in my life and accomplished a lot of really cool things. I traveled, got my degree, had hobbies, friends, an SO, and was really smart. But none of that changed that I wanted to die. I wasn't necessarily suicidal, I didn't want to kill myself, but if I was to get hit by a bus or fall of a cliff snowboarding, than fuck yeah. I don't even really believe in an afterlife. I wasn't looking to get to heaven or have some transcendental experience, although I'd have been cool with that. I just wanted to cease all living/activity, to go to sleep and never wake up. All the ""fun"" I got out of life never overcame the day in day out stress and expenditure of energy required to keep living. Anyway I took shrooms once in my life (really damn hard to get a hold of in my circles) During that trip I had an epiphany. I met God (happens a lot on my trips) and he explained to me why living is better than dying and what an amazing opportunity life is. After sobering up, I don't remember what he said, why it was compelling, or how it made sense, but that day alleviated my desire to die. That was nearly three years ago. I've had those feelings again rarely over the last year but never anything as strong as before, and I always remind myself that although I don't know what it is that makes it so. Life is better than death.

2. The safest place to carry drugs is in your bloodstream. If you're out and about, consume substances before leaving the house. Remember, it's not illegal to be high, it's illegal to possess controlled substances **on** (not in) your person.

3. If you have to drive with drugs in your car, store them in a bag in the trunk, and obey *all* traffic laws. Ever seen the show ""COPS?"" People always get busted for something silly, like failure to signal, or failure to stop at a stop sign. Cops will pull you over only if you give them a reason to pull you over. 

4. If you live with people who don't approve of you using drugs, be sure to store smelly items in an airtight Mason jar. Hide items inside of false-bottom containers or in a safe. Also consider the old ""hollow carved-out book"" trick.

5. Familiarize yourself with the [drug detection periods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test#Detection_periods) if you have a drug test in the near future. If staying sober is difficult and you're fighting cravings, inhale some nitrous oxide.

6. You can smoke in the house by placing a fan in the window facing out on maximum speed and keeping your smoking utensils right in front of the fan the entire time.

7. Always know how you react to a substance before you go out in public on it. The more drugs you do in general, the better you'll be at acting normal while under the influence. Experienced users have the knowledge and self-control to be able to sit in one place quietly and enjoy the high without ""the giggles"" or altered behavior. Much of this self-control is learned only with age or experience, it cannot necessarily be learned and understood by simply reading it.

8. Lastly, always be safe, start with the lowest dose and work your way up when trying something new, and consider having a ""sitter."" Do exhaustive research on both Wikipedia and Erowid before trying anything. Learn some pharmacology: even a basic background in pharmacology, and which drugs bind to which receptors, can yield massive benefits on which substances are safe or unsafe to mix with others, or any prescription or OTC medicines you may be taking.

**EDIT:** Okay so there may or may not be some inaccuracies in my post but I am telling you that following the advice I have given has always worked for me. I have never once gotten in trouble from following these tips, but keep in mind what works for me may not work for you, and it depends what jurisdiction you live in too. Take this post with a grain of salt, this is not hard-and-fast legal or medical advice.

Keep in mind a ""tip"" is a tidbit of advice, I did not title my original post ""100% true hard and fast rules that will always protect your ass 100% of the time."" Please try to add your own tips instead of criticizing mine, I am already fully aware of things I have said that are not completely accurate, as they have already been pointed out to me by autistic Redditors with assburgers syndrome.

[Erowid link](http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtml)

[Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms)

Todays FAQ deals with a drug whose usage may date back further than any other drug in existence, with cave paintings and statues possibly depicting this psychoactive fungus and at least one (disproven) [theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#The_.22Stoned_Ape.22_Theory_of_Human_Evolution) and one [comedy routine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baeT3g7udho) suggesting its archaic use.

-------

**First synthesis:** Evolved into their current form, though the active chemical, psilocybin, was isolated and synthesized by none other than the father of LSD, Albert Hofmann. [Take a look at this, it's a pretty good read.](http://www.stainblue.com/ah.html)

**Intended use:** No widespread medical uses. Currently used as a recreational drug and [entheogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogens). 

**[Current research into medical applications:](http://www.maps.org/research/)** None directly with any of the fungi, but a wealth of studies have recently completed or are currently underway involving psilocybin. These include determining any nootropic properties it may have as well as it's effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, [cancer-generated anxiety](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.116), nicotine addiction, [depression](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jan/23/magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-depression-drug) and cluster headaches. Oh, and then there's [this US government-funded study](http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/577702) that you likely haven't heard much about.

**Legality:** Far too convoluted to condense into a satisfactory description here (some countries ban everything, some have decriminalized small amounts, some allow for the sale of spores). Have a look at [this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_psilocybin_mushrooms).

Drive to the EZ Mart, hand the guy some money, and I've got my fun for the next two days. Except now, I cough all the time. I'm feeling depressed. I don't really want to do much of anything but smoke and watch Netflix. So I quit. I'm done. I broke my piece. I got mad at it. I looked at my bank account as I was at the ATM, getting some more money for my habit. I didn't have enough. How did I spend all that money? Oh, right. Spice and munchies. So, that's it. No more. It hasn't even been a day yet, but I already miss it. I used to tell people ""No! It's not addictive! And it's legal! It's perfect!"" But now I see that it's all lies. Sure, it's 'legal' and sure, it's a lot easier to get a hold of than actual cannabis. But weed didn't give me hangovers. I didn't ditch friends so I could smoke weed by myself. I didn't lie to my parents about where my money went, because I didn't buy it that often. I hope I've quit for the last time. I want my life back. My money. My friends. Oh, wait, I don't have any of those anymore. I stopped seeing them and I can't even remember why. 

I hope I've quit spice forever.

Edit: Wow, this post was a lot more popular than I ever thought it'd be. Thanks a lot for the encouragement and idea on how to get my mind off things. I'll admit I was trying to dodge some responsibility, but I am done playing around. Now to get my addictive personality addicted to something useful and productive!
Edit of an Edit: I'm going to take someones advice in the comments and keep you guys updated every day this week. Yes, I know, will I deliver, or am I fag? We'll see.

Day 1: It's officially been 24 hours since I last smoked. I'm feeling alright, I suppose. A little bored. I'm still smoking cigarettes, so that helps a bit. I'm going to write a short story tonight for a group I'm in, and then probably go to bed. If you're wondering why I'm up so late, it's because I work 3rd shift doing data entry, so this is kind of my early evening. See you tomorrow!

Day 2: 48 hrs. Had a good day at work and my mood was pretty good. Didn't wake up until only an hour before work, but that's fine. I'm going out in about an hour with a friend from work. Need the distraction."	t5_2qh7l	True

A few months ago I flew from the US to Canada, and without thinking about it, I brought along my razor.  I shave with an old-fashioned safety razor, so it has an actual blade, not a cartridge.  Now, when I went through security and the TSA agent found it, I was totally prepared to just give them the blade and be on my way.  But nope, they pulled me aside for a full search.  They unpacked my luggage, going through all my personal items one by one, checking inside clothing pockets, and wiping everything down with some kind of chemical test thing.  They searched me completely, had me lift up my shirt and a female agent felt all over my boobs and inside the band of my bra, and thoroughly felt all over my hip and crotch area outside my pants.  It took about half an hour and felt pretty violating.  I wasn't carrying any drugs, but if I'd had so much as a joint I probably would have been fucked.  Even if I'd been hiding it in my vag, I would have been nervous as hell, which would have looked suspicious.

So, be very very careful.  I don't think it's wise to take drugs on a plane at all, but if you're going to risk it, check the [TSA's prohibited items list](http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items) and make sure you don't accidentally bring anything that will get you searched."	t5_2qh7l	True

wtf nothing is happening, take another 2 hits

colors gradually start to become stronger

trying to avoid glancing at people

starting to get anxious, I may have taken too much

don’t want to freak out in the middle of the fucking beach

look at clouds, maybe they are bunnies

clouds look like faces, of a man and a woman

it’s mom and dad


look away from the sky, stare at the sand

footprints in sand look like screaming faces of hungry ghosts

look back at sky

mom’s face is full of pain and dad’s face is wrathful

mfw I realize that guilt and fear (feelings evoked by god aka parents) come from above and push to keep my head down, whereas aggression 
and rage come from the ground (nature) because they are natural instincts


can’t look at the sky nor the sand, have to look at people

afraid that someone will pop into my field of view and i’ll scream terrified

sit down in the shade of a shack

start talking into tape recorder

i must look like a lunatic mumbling to himself alone


take out a cigarette, hands shake

promised myself I won’t run home to my girlfriend

need to prove to her that I can spend time alone

need to prove to her that I don’t need constant attention

people walk all around me, what if someone asks what am I doing?!

fucking bitch girlfriend, can’t rely even on her?

need to prove that I’m a strong man

but that’s my dad’s mistake, denying his vulnerability

don’t want to be like dad, it’s okay to be weak sometimes

girlfriend will think I’m needy and pathetic


if I can’t even spend a couple of hours by myself on the beach then what good am I?

it’s me who wanted the LSD, it’s my fun time with myself

cigarette’s almost over, any minute now someone will see I’m crazy

I should shout for help, this is the lesson of the trip

if I’m able to shout for help in a public place I’ll never be afraid to ask for help again from friends


a woman and her child are walking by

LSD will make me scream for help involuntarily and that will heal my soul

the mother is looking at her child, ignoring me

no, I won’t fucking do it

I won’t demand her attention

why? not because of the social norms, but because her child needs her attention

I have no right to deny a child his mother’s undivided attention


so that’s it? I’m left alone to nurture myself?

this is fucking high school all over again

nobody’s there for me? again I have to be strong?

I’m sitting in the fetal position trembling with anxiety

more LSD effects kick in


perspective grows like magnifying glass

time is slowing down

oh my god this could last an eternity

gonna call my girlfriend

no

I won’t turn my girlfriend into my mom

I should call mom right the fuck now and demand some answers

maybe I should wait until the trip is over

so that’s what it’s about? ‘not now’?

only later, when I won’t need it?

what’s the matter mom? you’re too busy?

what’s so important? what’s the rush?

there’s no time?

time?

no time?


mfw

mfw

mfw deeply hurt and bitter


THERE’S AN ETERNITY TO BE ALONE

THERE’S ETERNITY TO BE ALONE

AND YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT’S GOING TO END AT ALL


*bitter tears of resentment at having been treated unfairly*


even if I would call mom, she’s too hung up on her own problems to be of any use

well who then?

who can be expected to give me 100% of their attention 100% of the time?

if only I could figure this out I could be relaxed

need to understand, need to figure this out


why?

what do you need to understand for?

isn’t it enough that I need comfort?

do I have to have a reason?

only myself I can hold up to that standard of 100% attention

and even I don’t live up to it

just like mom didn’t

the nurturing aspect of my personality still doesn’t give its full attention

well now it does


if I don’t dedicate time and attention to myself, no one will

I’m holding myself and I’m relaxing

just be with myself when I need it

keep being with myself, focus attention on myself

anxiety fades, for real for the first time


notice the sunset beginning

the sky’s colors are amazing

this is bliss, this is where it all disintegrates into pixels, into the unity of everything

hold on a fucking minute

not everything is the same, some of it is more beautiful

i want to see the effects and the colors of the sunset


horizon is wide, beach looks like an endless desert

some people walk alone, some walk in pairs

accompanying each other as long as their feet can take them

in the long journey through the desert of life


reminds me of long walks on the mountains

after a while you’re deep into thoughts, walking

that’s the journey of life, everyone keeps walking their path

where to? the sunset is right in the middle of the horizon

like a magnificent picture

with a long curvy road stretching towards the sun

home, they all walk the long road to get home


am I willing to start walking?

alone, like everyone else?

I have a girlfriend at home waiting, that’s how easy it is for me

some people don’t even have that

that’s how easy it is for me to start walking


I imagine that I’ll walk blindly into the sea and when I arrive I’ll actually be back at home

LSD would lead me home though it will appear as a road into the sea

I didn’t know how right I was, though in the metaphorical sense

I walk until I get to the sea and I start climbing the rocks



I’m tripping my eyes off, I might slip and break my neck

but that’s how life is, you need to get over the obstacles to be able to rest

I inch my way up the rocks until I get to an empty spot

so many hardships to go through just to get a little rest


I sit down, now I can look at the sunset

holy shit it’s beautiful

I need a cigarette.. where’s my bag?

I search frantically in the bag so I can enjoy the sunset properly

mfw wtf am I doing?

the sun is almost down! by the time I find a cig it’ll be gone!

the cigarette never enhances the experience, it distracts from it!

I laugh hysterically and look at the sunset


oh man the sun is so brilliant

it was there all along for me to watch the sunset in its magnificence

while I was struggling with untangling my anxieties

this amazing view is always there for me to see

(and the sunset is fucking amazing on LSD)


the beauty, all I needed to do was to pay attention

the beauty is always there for me to see

will always be there for me to see


OH GOD


THE BEAUTY WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME TO SEE

the sun is setting

life is setting

so little time

I’m overwhelmed with ecstatic sorrow

look at the sunset! forget everything, take in all the beauty you can!


oh man the sun is so brilliant for teaching me this

all it had to do was to look good and wait for me to realize

this must be what meditation is all about

focusing your attention on extracting all the beauty you can from the moment

because there’s so little of it

and because life, like the sun, is setting

where the fuck is my mind wandering again? keep looking at the beauty!


it’s almost gone into the sea

please, I haven’t lived! just a little more!

and the sun comes back up, I shit you not, it rises back from the sea

I moved the fucking sun with my thoughts

AND I FUCKING GET IT

I’ll take living in any moment from now on, with all of its imperfections

because if I put enough attention into it

maybe, just maybe, the very little beauty there is in this life will stay a little bit longer for me to watch


and with that the sun finally sinks into the sea and disappears

a drop in the ocean

the drop that is my entire life

and how small it is in the ocean of everyone else's"	t5_2qh7l	True

1329701283.0	px50o	I beat severe depression using shrooms.	enthos	453	76	135	"So it's the day after one of the most amazing nights of my life, and I don't have too much to say (Human language isn't good enough). But there are a few things I want to share.

Firstly, I had been clinically depressed and wondering what the point of my life was for around 3 years. Depression is a very stubborn illness, and I just couldn't seem to beat it. I lost most of my friends, my family seemed to stop trying to help me, and even I stopped trying. So, after reading about another depression sufferer's success with psilocybin, I decided to give it a try.

The trip itself was not at all what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to mostly be about hallucinating, and seeing things that weren't there, but that's not what happened at all. I mean, there was a little bit of that (walls and trees ""breathing,"" surfaces seemed to shimmer, and colors were incredibly vibrant; it seemed like I was seeing life in HD) but mostly, what defined it for me, is just an **amazing feeling**. Paradoxically, it was the most organic feeling I've ever experienced, and yet it was completely foreign. 

So while the visual hallucinations were awesomely beautiful, it was the pure, simple happiness that got to me. After being depressed for so long, I had literally forgotten what it was like to be happy, and, in retrospect, that's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone now that I know how amazing being truly happy can be. 

While tripping, I felt like nothing was stopping me from being the person I wanted to be. It was complete confidence, and I could be completely straightforward and friendly with everyone there with me. It's almost like alcohol in that it gives you confidence you don't believe you have sober. The difference is that alcohol seems to give you ""fake"" confidence like you aren't smart enough to recognize the consequence of your actions, while shrooms just reveals your latent confidence that your own insecurities bury inside of you.

Going forward, I've learned to manage negative thoughts through strategies I realized effortlessly while tripping. For some reason, even though everything seems more complex while on shrooms, life itself just seems so simple. I just hope I can maintain this good feeling for a long time."	t5_2qh7l	True

Two hits, grids of light and a spiraling flower of life appear in front of my eyes.



Three hits...



""I hope I didn't eat too much before this, I hope I inhaled enough, I hope...""  My mental worries simmer down to a halt, any sense of self is quickly dispersed and my own mind feels as if a congregation of entities is scrutinizing my being.


""You're going to do just fine. You're going to do.....just.......fine...""

Boom, boom, boom, my heartbeat becomes the rhythm of my existence.  My breathing is no longer under my control.  My lungs fill with as much air as they can hold, and exhale with a great Wooooosh that sends the blood flowing through my veins.  With every second my body fills my lungs with air, exhales as much as possible, and I fall.  I fell deeper than I could have imagined, before my head even hit the pillow my eyes had shut and a veil of flowing light sweeps over the room.  I fall into the fetal position, and the comfort of being somewhere I had been a million times before takes over.  I'm home. 

""Do you know why you're here?""

""Yes.""  Before I could even think of an answer, my mind knew what to pronounce to whoever was talking to me.

""What is the meaning of life?  What is life?  Who am I?  What was I?  What is anything?""

With every question I ask, the universe seems just a bit more simple.  The presence I felt answering my questions would inform me before I even finished the question.  My own mind was having an internal dialogue with my ego.

""You will do just fine.  You will do just fine.  You will do just fine.""


My human face appears before my eyes, but I do not know what it is.  I blink, and I know my name.  I blink again, and I know my lover's.  I open my eyes and they fill with tears.  

As if I had fallen to earth from a billion light years away, I'm back.

together to donate $1711 after the last Erowid Monthly. 

We've received several useful suggestions for individuals and

I understand what it is, how it works, what it does. I'm an experienced psychedelic user, and I know my way around most benzos, opiates, amphetamines, etc. 

Never a deliriant though, and my curiosity was stroooong.

So I figured I would add to my ""resume"" if you will and give diphenhydramine (Benadryl) a shot. I read up on Erowid and a few forums to acquaint myself with it, and spent the day going to class. 



**11:00 PM-** I popped sixteen 25mg tablets of Target's generic sleep aid for a total of 400mg DPH. Sat down to Reddit and watched some South Park, all the lights in the house off.

**11:30 PM-** My head's slightly heavier and my eyes are hard to keep open. This was expected, I've used this stuff to aid sleep in the past but only in VERY small doses. I keep reading.

**12:00 AM-** Now is when I start to feel it strong. A slight buzzing sensation starts up in my arms and legs, combined with a slight rushing in my ears.

**12:15 AM-** My ENTIRE body is warmer than usual, sweating a bit, and feels like I need to move. Hands are twitching and shaking slightly making typing hard. 

**12:45 AM-** A movement in my peripheral vision drags my attention away from  my screen and HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS there's a shadowy dark guy standing next to the door staring at me. I said ""Hi,"" being curious. He shook his head and disappeared into mist. This freaked me out significantly. 

**1:00 AM-** I look up again, still anxious, and he's back. This time he brought a friend. My heart rate SHOOTS up and I scramble back in the bed as the new shadow guy steps toward me, turning to mist as he touches my bed. Fuuuuck. I jump to the light switch and fall down in the process. My muscles are loose and feel like I'm moving them far too fast. The light (thank god) turns on.

**1:15 AM-** With the light on I haven't seen anything else. I decide to walk (slowly) to the kitchen to get a drink, my mouth is more dry than it's ever been. So I step out of my room and walk into the dark hallway. This was my first mistake, as in the next room I can see movement when I'm alone at home. I suck it up and keep walking like I'm wearing leg braces. Entering the kitchen was my second mistake. Three balls of hovering black lightning each floated a foot or so off of the tile floor. I shout ""FUCK"" and hobble as fast as I can back to my room. They follow me.

**1:30 AM-** Once I hit the threshold of my door, I'm sweating HARD and shaking all over. The dark lightning balls try to come in but swell up against the light pouring out of my room like waves on a beach. I'm significantly not okay with this, so I put on my big fancy headphones and listen ""Golden Brown"" by the Stranglers on repeat. Good vibes from this song.

**2:00 AM-** I've fully decided I do not want this real nightmare shit anymore. I won't leave my room and keep my eyes directly on the familiar screen and let the music surround me. (That's a positive I suppose, music is a bit better.) After the song plays a few times I take my headphones off and surprise surprise, there's a conversation going on in the dark hall outside my room in deep male voices. At this point I assume it's the two figures I saw earlier. Very clear, frightening, and talking about me. 

**2:15 AM-** I couldn't sleep before this point, but now I'm feeling tired and emotionally drained enough to maybe drift off. I shut the door clumsily and leave the lights on. I'm pretty sure around this time is when I went back to sleep.

**10:30 AM** I wake up with a glass of water on the nightstand next to me, which means I got up again and don't remember it. I feel fine, better than I usually do the morning after drugs, but I'm still slightly paranoid about what I saw. 



So I've learned I do not like this. I won't be doing it again, but overall it was a learning experience, albeit an unpleasant one. The hallucinations were far different from what I have experienced with acid or shrooms. These ones I couldn't tell were visions, and I was legitimately afraid of them. There was no control over the experience, no sense of reality and a trip. It was horrible, twitchy, scary as fuck, and like I have now experienced the body load is a LOT to deal with. Physically and mentally unpleasant. 

I hope you enjoyed the read, I figured I would share what I learned. Keep being an awesome community."	t5_2qh7l	True

Today, I moved out of my apartment.  I'm still here packing.  I'm here because I have a few days left, cause it's difficult, and because i'm at a juncture.  In one week I moved from an existence of relying on others to a self maintained one.  Talk about a flip.

I've had a job since I could.  I've sold drugs since I could.  As school faded out, I quit my local job.  A friend got arrested, I quit selling.  I've always had more money than anyone my age, more drugs, but I've always been honorable and done it my way.  Still, somehow... I'm sitting here on a minute amount of MDMA (.15-.2 and a half bottle of wine), mulling over my life and my possessions as I pack everything I've ever owned. 

I just want to say: appreciate that which you have and those around you.  Not everything is a means to an end.  Life moves in one direction.  Don't get lost in the ups or uppers, the downs or the downers.  Use your head and use the substances you come in contact to enrich, appreciate, and understand the world *as you see fit.*

7 days ago I started a 10 day fast. I am only eating magic mushrooms and drinking fresh squeezed juices. 

I am having amazing results and I have documented my journey on a blog.

http://crackediphoneglass.wordpress.com/


What I have learned so far
- Mushrooms are conscious and when you work with them for long periods of time with an intention to learn and grow they will give you buckets of wisdom and understanding about life and the universe.

- Tolerance - I have eaten mushrooms several days in a row. The effects have changed but haven't decreased. I am not looking for visuals, specific feelings, or a certain experience. Everyday the experience is new. The first day was filled with visuals and the days after not so much. However, the thoughts that I am thinking, the feeling of bliss and expansion, and the visions I am having are out of this world. 

- It has been 7 days and I feel amazing. Clear. Focused. Attentive to my blog...responsible I guess :) What I am trying to say is that I don't think the mushrooms are having a negative mental effect on me. 

I am learning so much.

I have tried quitting before, but the lack of sleep was too much for me. I felt like I was tripping on acid, was completely scatter-brained, and I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. The longest I ever made it without taking them was 3-4 days. I took my last one on my birthday and didn't have the money to buy anymore. The 31st was the worst day because I hadn't slept the night before. Somehow I've been able to make it 10 days without any and I'm so excited. Does anyone have experience with kicking benzos and can give me an idea how long the withdrawls will last. I still feel quite jumpy, my skin is sensitive, but I have managed to sleep ok except for the one night. I will be so happy if I can put this all behind me!
Edit- Just wanted to clear some things up, first of all I am a female. Apparently there ARE girls on reddit :) Also, most recently I was taking 1mg every day to every other day. I had tapered down to this amount over a few months. Quitting benzos cold turkey can be very dangerous. 
Also, Thank you SO much for your encouragement. It means a lot to me. Hopefully I'll be able to do an update once I've made it 30 days to let everyone know how it goes.

1362325610.0	19kv7c	My understanding of how trips go bad.  Hopefully this will help someone out there.	bubblerboy18	412	71	195	"  When tripping on acid, its pretty common to get some bad thoughts, see a visual that can scare you shitless, see images, or even think thoughts that just plain scare the hell out of you.  Well if it hasn't happened to you, it still has the possibility of happening to you, and this had happened to me on my last LSD trip.  
  

  The number one mistake I made during that trip was trying to ignore those visuals, those bouts of schizophrenia, the psychotic breaks, and instead trying to force myself to think of happy thoughts.  Studies in psychology have found something called the ironic rebound effect by doing the white bear study.  Try this now: Do not think of a white bear for 5 minutes (if you're going to do it, set a timer for 5 minutes).  Whether you tried it or not, you will find it is extremely hard to not think about a white bear, let alone trying to not think about crazy thoughts and visuals.  This is because your brain handles the order do not think about something in an extremely weird way.  The very fact that you are trying not to think about a white bear will actually cause you to think harder and harder about the white bear.  Eventually it will overcome you.  You may ask, ""why can't I stop thinking about this? Whats wrong with me? It can take you into a state of paranoia.  Now Imagine tripping and seeing something scary, or thinking bad thoughts.  The more you try to push away those thoughts the worse it gets and the more those thoughts encompass your trip.  I would say to myself, ""think happy thoughts, it's all in your head, you are normal, come on don't think about it, think about your girl friend.  Think about happy things, listen to music.""  No matter how much I tried, I could not get the thought out of my head (In fact, it came back even more intensely).  
  

  I should have changed my approach to the situation.  I figured out my flawed approach after my recent roll on MDMA two days ago.  I had smoked on the comedown and the visuals were pretty awesome but brought back some negative vibes. I heard myself say to stop thinking about the visuals, but I cought myself.  I reminded myself about the ironic rebound effect and told myself, ""Fuck this fear.  It is normal to see this, I am on a drug that causes hallucinations. Yes, I am scared right now, but it is normal.  I will be fine and these visuals and mindset changes are not going to cause me harm if only I evaluate the situation.  By avoiding the sitiation you tend to make it worse 99% of the time. 
  

  So insted, I tell you guys, face your fears and situations, confront the situation.  The more you beat around the bush and the harder you try and think happy thoughts and to stop thinking about what is bothering you, realize you are going to think about it more, and it will drive you crazy. I would like to hear some of your experiences here, bad trips, how to save a trip that was going bad, what pushed your trip over the edge, do you see where my logic can explain your bad trip? why or why not.  I'd love some feedback as this text is from a realization from a book I have read and and MDMA experience so thanks guys.  Hopefully this has the potential to save someone from going off the deep end.  Ask me anything you need.  Thanks!

TL;DR

Don't avoid scary thoughts or scary visuals. The more you avoid them the worse they will get.  Acknowledge them, and discuss your visuals and thoughts with yourself and the anxiety and harmful thoughts should subside.

No one drug is more 'okay' or 'right' than another, and if you think otherwise, you need to check yourself out of here as far as I'm concerned. If you are an advocate for recreational, responsible drug use, you need to be prepared to commit to that ideal and that means accepting such usage can be applied to *all* drugs. Yes, some are more dangerous than others, but none have more of a morally 'correct' stance than others. You are not here to judge others for their drug use, whatever they use. That is the complete, polar opposite of why this sub was created, and it just harms our cause if we walk around saying ""this is okay, but this is not"". You don't get to pick and choose and you're applying the exact same logic to those drugs you think are 'bad' that those 'squares' we all complain about are applying to your drugs of choice.

is although questionable, just a friendly reminder that love carries on regardless of it's age, beauty, or the paths it's taken. Being advertised at 80% one can safely assume
that it would be closer to 45 or 50%. Need not worry as the only contaminates besides half shot low dose ergotamines would be cotton fibers, dyes, dust, and well... other 
somewhat natural stuff ;). 

Through the course of this thread (this is a thread?) I will document the laying procedure of 200 hits of LSD onto blotter. The crystal (LOL) pictured below is only bagged for
purposes of easy storage for this shot. Typically it would come right off of the scales and into a solution. Actually that wasn't honest, typically it would have come straight
out of it's packaging into a glass of ethanol. But this is jungle juice and while one should care and respect it, treating it as anymore than a pawn would be an embarrassment.

http://i.imgur.com/JZetPuH.jpg

A little setup with the lights on to show what all we'll really need to get this going. Just a simple pyrex dish, a drying rack, some high proof etoh, a dropper, and a nice
print to set the mood. 

http://i.imgur.com/1I4LzCJ.jpg

So we'll begin from here so bear with me. I will answer questions as needed and document the process as I go. Not sure how I can verify myself other than posting up a signed
pic but I'll be happy to answer anything regardless. 

I am only laying 200 hits as that is what was partially left over from a previous lay. The quality as I said is guesstimated, but should be around 48-50mg for a total of 200 110mcg
hits. Yes the math works out to more, but we are working with very unpure product here. So we assume a 50% purity and a little loss through runoff and other environmental factors.

Stay tuned! 

______________________________



Well the genie caught up to me quick! LOL! But no worries we shall continue. Of course it's always nice to have a home brew on hand while laying your hits. 

http://i.imgur.com/IROd7u4.jpg

So we add the xtal to 40ml of etoh. Why so much you ask? Well typically one would weight the paper and then know the exact amount needed to saturate the hits evenly. However
given the fact that this is jungle juice, not being laid, and only 200 hits, we take the strike/dropper approach. So we need more solution to work with to continuously saturate
these sheets. Kind of like how dogfish head does a continuous dry hop addition to their ipas :) :)

This also can lay to rest the whole ""double dipped"" myth. Sure, the sheets, pages, packs can be double dipped. Hell, they can be quadrupedal dipped! If the solution is being laid
onto unweighed paper or someone is trying to be careful and squeeze every last drop out evenly, multiple lays are the way to go. However it's very impractical when you are laying
in packs.

As you can see we drop in this nasty purplish green/gray xtal into the etoh. After a few stirs and one pull/push from the plunger the color is quite clear. Now it is heavily 
diluted but this should prove another point. Even wash from several batches will turn crystal clear for the most part. As with any lsd xtal the ""color"" doesn't matter. It can
be lavender, champagne, swiss miss, jungle juice, fractal fluff, etc... they will all mostly dissolve clearly. 

http://i.imgur.com/dEAgx3E.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/jrFwcGw.jpg

______________________________________________________________________________________


So we count out our hits and I divided them into two separate sheets to contain the runs. Not a worry when you're dealing with pages but with lower amounts it can lay unevenly.

http://i.imgur.com/px7opmV.jpg

We then take and apply 2ml of solution to each sheet. This takes a bit of finese to not have an over spill or unevenly lay. When dropping/striking do just that ""STRIKE"" go in 
slashes across the page but make it uniform. Diagonal, Sideways, Up, and Down!!! Be careful around the edges as it will spill and you'll lose potency with enough spills.

http://i.imgur.com/dFuxXpf.jpg

Once it is saturated it's time to wait. 

http://i.imgur.com/uDJRbNj.jpg

This will need to be done 18-20 more times. I give the uneven gap for the fact that as you progress some paper will soak up faster than 
the other. But from here it's just like learning to driving a stick shift car... at first it's a bit difficult and you have to get it done just perfectly. Once you shift into the 
higher gears however it all just flows. Until something fucks up of course ;)

So yes the waiting game... I'll update with more pics as it progresses but not EVERY strike (LOL). 

That's the jist of it though folks. Perhaps soon I will make a shot of laying a pack as it's a bit more interesting! :)

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Well I have more pics but they are quite blurry. All basically the same concept of strike, wait, strike, wait, etc.. However I was going to show how you would deal with the bubble up when laying this way. After your 10th saturation or so the sheets will start to bubble up. Couldn't get a good picture of this, but I'm sure you can all
understand! :)

The easiest way is to not let it dry out that fast, but that's not always possible. When it happens though, when striking just hold down the sheets with a pair of tweezers (or something of the sort). This will flatten the sheet back out once more solution is added. If you don't flatten it, the solution will run off the sheets and cause an uneven lay. 

Here are the finished products though. After several hours it's finished and could have been done quicker. However a more diluted solution makes for easier control with dosage. Not to mention the loss you will have if it does runoff is minimal. 

http://i.imgur.com/fVXPEmv.jpg


In cellophane and about to go into a book for storage. This is possibly the best storage your average Joe can do. While it would be nice for us all to vacuum seal our sheets with a dessicant pack and powdered with ascorbic acid, then placed into a mylar bag and stored in a dark climate controlled room... it's just not typical. However let this also shine some light on the ol' ""if it's bitter, it's a spitter"". That is not always the case! I have had AMAZING L that was bitter from storage. It could be the medium it was laid on, the dyes for the print, or the fact they used ascorbic acid while storing. The majority of the time though, it's a good rule of thumb that it shouldn't be 
IN YOUR FACE bitter. 

http://i.imgur.com/vy6etK3.jpg

Stay away from aluminum foil. In smaller amounts it's not a huge issue but several problems arise. One being speculated mostly that L and aluminum oxide don't play well together. This is present in foil and even more so in foil stored in colder and moist conditions (ie, freezer/fridge). There is also the fact that the foil can become quite rigid with a lot of handling and in large amounts can cause small tearing that effects beautiful prints and possible loss of exposed xtal on the sheets. 

It is also speculated that polyethylene (ie: ziplock bags, sandwich bags) reacts with acid. Some say this is the reason you see ghost prints after you remove the L from bags. Personally I've stored it in plastic bags with no issues and also seen it laid in plastic bags. But for those that like to be purists stick with cellophane, a book, and a cool environment. This will provide the best bang for your buck as far as storage goes.

It would end up being one of the worst trips of my life. 

I drove to Baltimore (about an hour away) to pick a friend (we will call her E) up from her dorm so that we could go visit another friend (whom i will refer to as J) in Salisbury. Acid flows through that campus like water and, having been dry in our area for a couple months (this was the beginning of E's freshman year so she didn't have any connects in Salty Balti yet), we had become pretty psychedelically parched and of course we wanted summadat. 

J was dating this guy at the time who was just kind of... Out there. He was super sweet but he really was a weirdo with no social filter. The thing about that, though, was that he had a bunch of hot beardo weirdo friends and E and I were so all about that. 

We played music (J and her weird bf had a band and E &amp;amp;amp; I had a band) for a few minutes and then duder shows up with the blotters. 

After a careful cutting session on the kitchen table we were psyched to get the ball room even . 

Everybody doses. I am the last one. I go to put the paper on my tongue, it falls off my fingertip and lands on the white linoleum floor.

Did I mention that the floor was crooked? Like literally inclined. Also it was a college dudes house so the floor was filthy nasty. 

We looked around like a couple of crackheads but we couldn't find it. 

J's boyfriend, party time facilitator, offers to drive me to duders house to get another hit. Ok.

On the ride there (alone with him) he proceeds to tell me all about these crazy drug dealers who have apparently once ""cut a bitch"" who tried to sell them fake acid or something. Somehow this digresses into a monologue about his and J's sex life, how he wears a cock ring and loves it and obviously this shit is starting to kick in for him and I am sooooooooo not feeling it.

Shit is way too real how far are we? i am not on the same page get me out of this car.

A million years of awkward conversation later...

We get to duders. It's an rv parked in a trailer park. We go in and there is expensive dj equipment and records stacked everywhere (cool) with terrible graffiti (if you could call it that) spray painted all over the place. That's when I remember the cut a bitch story from the car.

J's boyfriend explains the situation, duder laughs and goes into some back room. 

A few minutes go by but it feels like hours because everyone is tripping except me at this point.

Duder comes back with a huge fucking knife with a curved/hooked/serrated/fuckinggutyoulikeapig blade. He has a crazy look in his eyes which are locked on mine. Oh my god hes gonna fuckin cut a bitch and the bitch is me holy poopdick what am i gonna do (meanwhile j's boyfriend is staring at his hands talking to Duder's roommate about Freemasons or some shit I mean no help at all). 

He says,

""Hey, bitch... 

- pause for dramatic effect, cocks head to the right - 

... You wanna fuckin' party? Stick out your tongue.""

A jolt of electric fear runs through me. The light refracts off the blade as he moves towards me and my life flashes before my eyes.

That's when I notice the little piece of paper on the tip of the knife. Fear subsides, rationality returns, I stick out my tongue, he places blotter gently on the tip of my tongue. I keep it in my mouth for a while then swallow. 

The trip only got worse from there. We had to call the cops TWICE while we were tripping to report two separate assaults we witnessed and I got desparately and awkwardly hit on by a stupid guy who was taking hits of nitrous while leaning on his enormous tank (stupid idea # one) while standing up (terrible idea # two). Of course he fell and cracked his head on some shelving. He had a huge bump on his head and kept alternating between ""you're real pretty can I kiss you"" and ""should I drain this bump? I think I'm gonna drain this bump"" in his fucked up nitrous voice in between more hits (dumb idea # 3). Then J was so whacked out she drove in reverse 10 blocks home and said that driving fast in reverse while tripping felt like it was ""meant to be."" 

When we were driving home the next day, as we crested the mountain and could see our Valley glittering in the heat, we were so happy to be home we cried like little bitches. 

I thought about posting this in r/Askreddit but thought it would be more appropriate here. Let me know if I was wrong. 

(Oh yeah don't be stupid remember the Internet is a public place and use a throwaway if you must)

Woah. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Keep 'em coming (and for fuck's sake be safe out there)

*The original post:*

Before you tell my darwin award worthy self to call an ambulance, i may just be freaking out, but this may be very real.


**The situation:**
70mg of very pure #3 insufflated(around 80% purity), 20mg lines within 3 hours of one another. I mixed the last line with 40mg pure cocaine ( approx 1 and ahalf hours ago). 


**My worries:** I nod off, and despite having a normal to slowed heartrate, my CNS will be so depressed that i simply don't breathe.
I feel as if i have to manually breathe in order to get air into my lungs; i've tried just sitting here waiting for my body to breath but I am forced to do it. I am resisting the urge to nod off quite heavily right now. 

I just sublingually ingested 40mg caffeine to try to keep my mind alert so that i wont nod off. 

**An ambulance will just complicate matters in the event that this is not an OD simply me freaking out as i comedown from the cocaine while the heroin keeps going strong...?**

Oh also, about an hour ago i took 1g piracetam, a multivitamin, 1g l-tryptophan and 1g l-arganine and 1g l-tyrosine, all in pill form, i feel as if they might be playing a roll in my anxiety/inability to breath automatically.

Any help, please!

So last night I was with some friends and a few of us decided to take shrooms and have a grand ole time. Well a sober friend, a drunk friend and I decided to take a drive (obviously the sober friend drove). All was well and good at first, I was enjoying the music and tripping to the lights from the city. Than I realized where we were going, I decided to not make a big deal out of it as no one knows that I ever was going to commit suicide. Well the place we went to overlooks the city and I cant explain how I felt but I'll try. I looked over the city and saw all the lights and it pulled me back to that moment when I was holding a gun to my head. The pain that I felt in that moment was as real as the first time I had been there but at the same time I was okay with it. I want to say that going through that experience has made me think less about suicide but it hasn't. What it has done though is made me okay with the situation that created the urge to commit suicide in the first place. I just hope that this first step of acceptance will bring better and brighter days for me. Again just needed somewhere to share what I felt last night and thought this would be the best place.

What I wanted to know was how many people working in the various fields of science have had any experience with LSD and other psychedelics. I've heard stories about scientific discoveries inspired by acid trips and its certainly something I can see being true. Some specific questions:

* Have you ever taken a psychedelic? If so, was it in your adolescence or adulthood? Just once, or multiple times?

* Was your interest in science perhaps sparked or fueled by your psychedelic experience? Have psychedelics given you a different perspective on your field of science?

* Was it a positive experience in your life, or do you regret it? (Not to be confused with: ""do you recommend this to others?"" I want to know if tripping was something you are glad you did in *your* life?)

**Just to be clear, I'm not looking for advice on whether to trip, I've already done that plenty, and I'm not trying to encourage anyone else to trip.

I asked my friends earlier today for input on how they would describe the high. They couldn't really even recall what it felt like, just that ""It was amazing"" or ""every moment felt brand new and unrelated to the past"". I've been reading pubmed, wikipedia(sources), etc... all day. I eventually stumbled across [this post on erowid experiences involving 3mg of melatonin and one hit from a bong that sounded exactly like what I had felt the first night](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=54295). I showed the page to my friends. This is EXACTLY what I felt. This is EXACTLY what they felt...except way more intense. We've gone ahead and picked out quotes that we feel best represent what was felt. Here they are:

&gt;There was a mild stonning effect, but mostly a spaciness, and a marked shift in thought patterns. Rather than forming logical sentences in my mind when replying to mail, I began spouting playful musings with only vague connections to reality. It was as if my imagination had flooded the logic centers of my brain. I literally could not think in any other terms than metaphorical or out and out fantastical without a great exertion of mental effort. [...]
&gt;At this point my mind was wandering in and out of dreamlike states. I would drift off to the point of actually having what almost seemed like auditory hallucinations, and then suddenly swoop back in and the music would come back in full force. My imagination was running wild. It was as if seven different dreams were playing in the back of my mind. I was in an almost hypnogogic state, eccept that it was more variable. Rather than being stuck between sleep and wake, I simply swung on a pendulum back and forth, now almost totally asleep, now almost wide awake. [...]
&gt;The music would change and be some other sound, the way that you incorporate an alarm clock bell into a dream, or the music would dissapear entirely, drowned out by what seemed like nearly intelligable sounds. Small intrumental aspects of the music would seem much clearer and more noticable than ever before when in the more 'waking' states. And let me say again, my imagination was running wild. Images supersaturated my mind. I can't remember it all clearly but there were entire dramatic scenarios playing in one conner of my brain, while quite literally, I had cartoons in another corner. I distinctly remember one about Bugs Bunny and another about a drill sargent. These were easily distinguished from actual hallucinations.

##UPDATE 2: I get it. My friends are dumb, retarded, reckless, idiotic fucks. No one knows that better than me, but please don't include me in the name calling. I warned them of the risks on multiple occasions. Sometimes the only thing you can do to keep them safe is to be there for them in case shit goes terribly wrong. Yes, I took 15mg (only slightly larger than a normal dose) of melatonin and smoked the first night. I don't regret it, it was nice. I'll likely do it again sometime.

I am posting this so that anyone searching google for how to get high on melatonin will have a chance to receive this warning:

Using melatonin to get high is definitely possible, but I strongly recommend against it. If you do choose to experiment, I recommend you take a lower dosage and smoke weed to accentuate the effects.

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT ABUSE MELATONIN FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

YOU WILL HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

About a month ago friends of mine heard about getting high off melatonin. Melatonin is a natural supplement and sleep aid.

They purchased a bottle and set about experimenting. At first each person consumed between 5-9 3mg melatonin. As expected, it made us all very chill and relaxed. My friends regularly smoke weed, and they did so after taking the melatonin.

The feeling is VERY relaxing.

However, over the course of a week my friends began to consume between 25-50+ (3mg) melatonin pills a night because they'd heard you can't overdose.

In amounts greater than 50mg, you begin to become disoriented/confused and feel similar to being blackout drunk without the dizzy bad feeling.

Combine that with smoking weed, and you will be KEYED.

Two friends were reduced to only being able to slur the response ""fuck haaaaaaa"" and ""I'm chillunnn'"" regardless of the question.

The first few days went without incident, but after about 2 weeks of continuous use strange things began happening.

One friend missed his midterm on a Thursday...because he thought it was Monday. He doesn't remember barely anything.

Another friend didn't sleep for 2 days after he stopped taking melatonin, even after taking triple the dosage of z-quil sleep aid.

Another friend who only took melatonin and didn't smoke was in a mental fog for the majority of the week even after taking adderall on a daily basis.

My friends range from 150-190lbs and range between 5'10"" and 6'5"" and all had negative effects.

Edit: I forgot to mention that the melatonin was only taken at night. They never took it during the day because of classes.

so I was deep in an amazing complete sensory crossover acid trip and ZZZZZZZZZZ my alarm went of...

I was meant to be at work, but I was sick... and tripping... and sick! (by the way, these text boxes in reddit are quite nice) 
So I needed to contact work, but I had no credit...

So... I had to go down to the 7/11 on the corner

grabbed what clothes I could, still covered with dirt from working yesterday, tied my dreadlocks back tight, and fell around the room looking for sunglasses, PLEASE SUNGLASSES...

FOUND. Good. Keys, grabbed out of the pants on the floor that are somehow now wet.... I don't remember that. WRONG KEYS... crap, and can't find normal keys and DONT HAVE TIME...

FINE I will leave the back door open. So I Go out the back door and leave it open. 

I go round the side, and try and go through the fence. It's locked.

FROM THE FRONT GAH

So I hang over the fence, from inside, unlock the fence, get inside, open it, get out, then head for 7/11

as I walk I notice time is travelling about twice it's normal speed - which is making walking fun!

The cars are all stretched, wrong aspect ratio douchebags.

I notice a big red ominous smear down my jeans - crap - must have spilt DXM on the earlier, only looks a hell of a lot like blood, whataver....


With the sunglasses on, i feel nice

I notice a mother with her daughter - avoiding me.

Another stranger, avoidance.

I feel good, so I try running, it's fun! I run all the way to the 7/11.

This is where shit hits the fan.

I'm pulling in EVERYTHING ive got to look normal.

Breathing - heavy, well.... I've just run 2 blocks...
Hair, *almost* in a pony tail... a few dreads poking out like antenna..
Sunglasses, half squashed, I'd tried to fix one of the nose pieces.

I notice my fly is undone, do it up, and in trying to clear up the dxm smear the red goo further down my leg.

At the time this was happening all i was concerned about was getting credit - but now I realise that's not what everyone else in there thought...

I notice now the guy in front left without paying saying anything or asking for a receipt - fast, like he was running.

I remember noticing another guy come in, throw his money on the counter and then sprint away, to which the casheir EXTREMEMLY nervously remarked (""nothing else? teehee"") 

I NOW remember noticing that she, as soon as i asked for credit, oppened the till and brought out close to her body what looked like one of those body-money holding things travellers use - I noticed it at the time, but at the time presumed she was trying to sell me something under the counter?

It was the first time I'd spoken since the trip started.

""CREDIT"" I accidently warp...

And here I think is where what I thought happened and what actually happened MUST split.... I'll tell my side of the story, as I saw it happen at the time. None of these previous things I've noted noticing had I noticed yet...

""$50 CREDIT"", I blurted

She slid out the register swiftly, revealing a dark material strip device; not interested in her wares, I re-insist, 'just the credit'.

GAH i'm still tripping, I can't write properly.

Anyhow. at the time i SWEAR she was HELPING ME. like she'd done it before, helped out a dozen guys before me, and she was doing me a favour.

to me she was AN ANGEL, my SAVOIUR, someone who UNDERSTOOD!

As I walked away with my credit it started to dawn on me though.

She was terrified

Horrified

I'm sorry 7/11 Lady :(

1373395371.0	1hy9k2	First experience with truffles	TruffleTrippin	385	73	156	"First off, I created a throwaway because many of my friends know my reddit username and i'd rather not post to r/drugs on my personal. Anyhow, this is the story of my first experience taking truffles.

Truffles, if you do not know, are essentially Shrooms. I took truffles and not shrooms because I, of all places, tripped in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, Shrooms are illegal, but truffles, since they lack the cap, are not in reach of The Opium Act, and therefore, are legal. 

Forgive me if that information is wrong, but that's what the store owner told me, haha.

So, I am originally from America, but I'm on vacation in Europe right now. I took a two day trip to Amsterdam, and while there, really wanted to find some weed. However, I'm with my family, so that wasn't much of an option. While shopping, I kept seeing ""Magic Mushroom"" advertisements, but had no idea if they were actually psychedelic, or if they were like those stupid cannabis flavored foods with no real THC content. So, I asked.

The lady told me that they were in fact capable of making me trip, so after a few hours and after a few shops, I said ""Fuck it"" and bought 10 grams (The normal dose apparently, seemed high to me as well) while nobody noticed. I then, at around 9:30 decided to go back to my hotel room and trip. Like I said, I'm with my family, but I ended up getting a hotel room by myself. The room number? fucking 420. 

At 9:52 I decided to ingest the truffles, which from now on I will just call shrooms because truffles sounds like chocolate. At first, I was a bit nervous, but I started feeling a little jittery at around 10:15. I was on my phone the entire time talking to my friends in the states, because I as alone and didn't feel like watching dutch television.

At 10:30 I felt the urge to laugh uncontrollably, and my vision started getting distorted. It was awesome! I thought that my trip was going to be like that for 4-6 hours, but at around 11:10, I was hit with a feeling that i've never experience before!

Suddenly, euphoria surged through my body and my head felt incredibly clear. I've smoked my fair share of weed, but damn, I have never had anything like this. Also, this was my first psychedelic trip. I no longer felt like I was on drugs, and I saw nothing wrong with the world. My speech became poetic, my typing fluid, and my thoughts very philosophical. 

This continued for hours, and in the meantime, I flipped on some dutch TV and started to watch some Bruce Willis movie from 1992 (Still dont know the name because i turned it on in the middle of it). This movie, was fucking AWESOME. I was laughing so hard and just really had a good time.

Wow, sorry for the wall of text. If i had to rate it I'd say that it was a 10/10 night, and i spent it alone, in my hotel room, with some fungi and a Bruce Willis Movie.

If you've read this far, thank you.

It's been 2 months and 21 days since thanksgiving morning, the last time I shot up.  Considering all that's happened in that time, I was actually pretty shocked that it hasn't been longer.  All my track marks are gone (thank god) and not a single bit of opiates has gone into me.  Opiates, these days, are the furthest thing from my mind.  I just plain don't think about them anymore, and they certainly aren't missed.  Unlike any of the other times I quit, this time I never got the whole PAWS shit where my head would start romanticizing them and I'd start craving them.  This time, nothing.  I finally saw opiates for what they really were to me.. a cavernous pit where my life and dreams were going to die.  I actually moved out recently and while I was packing up my desk I stumbled across a big old rock of heroin that I remember losing.  I remembered how heartbroken I was about that stupid little clump and how I tore my room apart for days trying to find it.  Needless to say that little ball of my former disease earned itself a very prompt trip to the toilet :P

If I were going to relapse, I figure I would have done it then.  I had been living with my family to save money, but moved out because recently, among other reasons, the fact that I'm gay started to be an issue.  It was a pretty rough time for me and being in that vulnerable of a state and not even thinking twice about actually using that heroin is a pretty good sign for me.  I felt no remorse as I flushed it and I never regretted the decision.

Anyway, the real point of this post is that I wanted to thank everyone.  When I quit, no one I knew in real life even knew I was ever an addict so I had absolutely no one to talk to about it.  The incredible support you guys gave me, all the people that've dropped me messages here and there checking up on me, really helped put me in a positive headspace.  I honestly don't know if I'd be clean today if I hadn't made that post, so from the bottom of my heart I thank you :)"	t5_2qh7l	True

Also, I puked, and that may be the worst thing that has ever happened. I don't know how I puked. It was like a cartoon. This poison just issued out from my body and into the sink. My best explanation for it so far is that I ate a burger and curly fries from Jack In The Box before I took the acid. Never heard of vomit being a side-effect of acid before. Man. That was terrible. I'm so hungry now, but I'm worried that if I eat anything, I'll puke again. There are some perfectly good apples, but I don't know how to eat them without ending up puking more.

There is an ant on my computer screen. Hey little guy, that's isn't food. I'm sorry.

There is something that looks like urine in a puddle on the floor under my record player. I am not sure how to tell if it is real or not. 100% sure that it isn't urine... then what is it? How did liquid get on my floor? It couldn't have come in the window... It didn't rain. My cat definitely couldn't fit under my record player to pee... And I certainly didn't pee. Well, on the floor at least.

Does anyone ever get over the feeling that they are just a complete waste of space? Does that feeling ever go away?

Edit: I have to go now. My friend is here to take me on my outing. This was, haha, a trip. Thank you for talking to me. I hope you got some enjoyment out of it. I'll come back later and try to tie up any loose ends.

Edit 2: I'm pretty much down now. That lasted a long time. I would like to report that there is **actually** a puddle under my record player. I have deduced that the sprinklers spray straight onto my window, and some water got in. Good to know. Going to clean that up in a minute.

I really appreciate everyone who commented here today. What did I learn? Let's see.

1. I really fucking love my mom, and should treat her way, way better.
2. I don't understand food &amp; fitness and am going to keep working on a system that provides my body with the proper nutrition and isn't morally objectionable. I bought a vegan cookbook for a few bucks today, so I might try that, as the idea of drinking milk still feels like drinking cow suffering. I still don't know what to think about my body image. Fat? Does it matter? This will be a work in progress.
3. I have issues about using sex to find love. It hasn't worked so far, so maybe I should try some different tactics in my search for another kaleidoscope mind. This will also be a work in progress.
4. I really miss my friend H. Not much else to say here. She's probably lost and I don't think anything that *I* do can save her.
5. I need to write more. The response that my little bits of writing here today produced were really encouraging, even though that isn't my normal writing, uh, style. I never show anyone my writing, and it's really good to get some positive reinforcement. I promise to report back about my book when I'm done, put a link in for a free download or something.

My cat says hello.

I think I still have some serious issues to work out, and I may use acid as part of my personal growth in the future. I like the little unanswered reminder I left myself, to tell the story about my father. I think those feelings are also deeply intertwined with my feelings about food and men/love/sex. I'll keep looking. Again, thank you so much. I'll come back, make some more comments. But right now I'm terribly sleepy from staying up all night and crying my little eyes out. Gotta go to work tomorrow. :)

THANK YOU.

1312951771.0	je9qb	I like drugs. Went to a festival, was disturbed by the drug use.	mindaltering	421	123	318	"Hey r/drugs,

I went to Shambhala music festival last weekend (in Salmo, BC, Canada). It's an electronic music festival that's very tolerant as far as drugs go. The music and scenery is really excellent and there is even a psychedelic forest area with art, benches, giant hammocks, etc.

My own context is that I smoke weed regularly, have done some mushrooms and the odd hit of e. I'm definitely okay with drug use and I did my first hit of acid there. It was great.

But I always grew up with advice ringing through my ears: drugs can be dangerous, know who you're buying from, know what you're getting into, drug cocktails are stronger than each drug individually, etc. The idea of popping unknown pills is disgusting to me, and I would never do a drug just because someone offered it to me. And if I'm relying on drugs to keep me entertained, then something's wrong.

It seems that sort of irresponsible drug use was the norm there. The guy in the tent next to us crawled out of it after he did 2CB, ketamine and mushrooms together and bragged about it to anyone who would hear. The next one over pulled out his ziplock baggie, found that all his pills had been crushed into powder and laughed how he was just going to do it all at once. I sat down to take a break from dancing and found myself next to a zombie who was trying to do a line of something off his hand and failing, pretty early in the night.

To me, drugs are an enriching part of my life. If they make me feel lethargic or hungover, I don't want to do them. And psychedelics, fun as they are, can and will kick my ass (and mind) if I'm not careful. But most of these 'kids'—actually just people my age—seemed to relish the opportunity to get fucked up, and only interested in doing as many acronyms as possible, no matter what the effects.

It surprised me to see the extent of it, and it really added a sour note to what would have otherwise been the perfect festival experience.

I'm amazed and want to share my story but due to its highly personal nature I only wanted to do so in an anonymous setting... ie reddit.

So about 3.5 years ago I was raped. It was brutal and violent. 

A few months later my boyfriend ""Mark"" and I started dating. The relationships was wonderful except one huge problem: sex. Whenever we were having sex, if he did anything similar to what my rapist did, I would have a flashback, which often turned into a full blown panic attack. It was impossible to know what would trigger me... Something as simple as placing his hand a certain way or grunting a certain way would send me into hysterics. It got to the point where I had so much anxiety about having a panic attack I couldn't enjoy sex, so it was impossible for me to get ""in the mood."" I would try to fake it for his sake, but that was physically painful and emotionally draining for me. Inevitably we would fail to have a good time, which led to shame and guilt. Eventually, we were unable to have sex at all.

It got so bad that even seeing sex in a movie or over-hearing someone talk about sex could throw me into a panic attack. I went to the doctor and she prescribed sertraline (generic Zoloft) and Klonopin. I was on that for 5 months and it did help my anxiety but it also made me feel like a robot and affected my personality, in addition to frequently making my stomach hurt. I decided it wasn't worth it and got off it.

Next I tried therapy, but having to relive the whole experience week by week was torture. I felt miserable and drained for days after each session. And I just didn't really like my therapist as a person. I could have gone to someone else, but I didn't want to have to tell the whole story again. So I just stopped going.

I fell into a pit of depression and self loathing. At this point we hadn't had sex in 11 months, and hadn't done ANYTHING sexual in over 8 months. He was very loving and patient, but I felt guilty holding him in a sexless relationship. I was also drinking a lot and pretty much always stoned, and I was paranoid and mean, and not fun to be around. I didn't think our relationship was going to last much longer.

Until shrooms changed everything.

I had some shrooms left over from the summer, and since the leaves are changing and summer is over I asked if he wanted to eat them with me. 

We had a lovely afternoon in the park and were relaxing in our living room listening to music. I was peaking at this point, lost in my head. Mark leaned over slowly and started to kiss me. As this went on I started to feel something I hadn't felt in ages... desire. I waited for the wave of guilt and shame that always accompanied it, but it didn't come. Only euphoria. Only want. Only love.

We kissed for a long time and then spent a long time cuddling naked, just cuddling, silently. I didn't know where he started and I ended. Then my perspective shifted, and I saw myself through his eyes... beautiful, perfect, worthwhile despite my many flaws. Like a scuffed jewel that can be polished to a new shine. Like a beautiful queen. I felt confident, and powerful. And I thought about my rapist, and how weak he was, and how pathetic, to have to beat a girl to get her forced affection. And I saw him in my mind, small and impotent, may miles away, lonely and lost, far from my kingdom.

We didn't go any farther that night. But the next night, when he kissed me good night, I felt it again. Desire without shame. Something I hadn't felt, really, since before my rape. 

And we had sex. And it was awkward and physically painful, but wonderful. And the next day, yesterday, we did again. Twice. 

Today I poured my remaining bottles of liquor down the drain.

I feel like a new person. Strong, confident. Ready to rejoin the world. Ready to love and be loved. 

All because these magic mushrooms repressed my shame and allowed me to see my own value through someone else's eyes. The last 3.5 years of my life are gone, but I don't care. I'm finally moving on."	t5_2qh7l	True

**A** They *might not* hurt you, but they *could* so don't eat them if you found them unless you are SURE you can properly identify them yourself. If you bought them from someone, you're fine, and you're gonna have a great time. 

**Q** ""I have [mental disorder], is taking xyz a good idea?"" 

**A** Do some research, but ultimately the decision to drugs or to not do them has to come from you, not strangers on the internet.

**Q** Where can I find more information about xyz?""

**A** The internet. Erowid. Google is your friend.

1340477932.0	vhqgq	The petition to remove Leonhart makes sense: she has personally obstructed drug policy reform	X3Maverick	350	47	25	"[The petition to remove Leonhart](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/fire-current-dea-administrator-michele-leonhart/TqZm0Yz5) is worth supporting.

Leonhart has directly intervened to kill scientific research that might jeopardize the Schedule I status of cannabis. See [here](http://wamc.org/post/umass-amherst-professor-says-he-will-appeal-dea-denial-medical-marijuana-grow). (""On August 8, a second ""final order"" was signed by U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Michele Leonhart denying the appeal of University of Massachusetts Amherst professor Lyle Craker to grow marijuana on the campus for research into the plant's potential medical applications. ... Craker's application was first denied in 2009, after a 2007 decision by DEA Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner that allowing him to grow marijuana would be, ""in the public interest."""") Those interested can [read the official denial here](http://www.maps.org/mmj/deafed_reg_craker_1_14_09.pdf) as published in the Federal Register.

As recently as June 2011, the DEA under Leonhart [officially rejected a 2002 petition](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/coalition_response.pdf) to reschedule cannabis after [nine years of the DEA strategically delaying a response to the petition](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/09/local/la-me-marijuana-20110709).

In light of the above considerations, **please sign this petition to remove Leonhart from office**:

1366858077.0	1d22qf	So I dropped .18 of some straight moon rocks	blorgbots	386	90	104	"And it's very interesting. There's a huge live music event outside celebrating the last day of classes at my University, but I don't feel inclined to join them. This was, of course, my original intention. After all, when you hear live techno music is coming round and you're a drug enthusiast you think of sweating your balls of in a huge crowd almost orgasming at the light show.

Instead, I've been sitting on a bench nearby bobbing my head to the music and feeling amazing with all the water I could want. It's interesting the niches we place drugs in. Sure, a stimulant like cocaine gives a very in-your-face short-lived uncomplicated response, so you know you're gonna party at that time.

MDMA, however, provides so much more. So far, I've made good friends with a pledge in my fraternity who I was not a fan of before, and I've had a conversation with my ex-girlfriend about how we will always have each others' backs, because we've been through waaaay too much together not to. Even if long-distance fucks things up, an amazing person is an amazing person. I feel fantastic and emotionally complete in a way I haven't for a long time, and I can only hope that some of the emotional progress I've made on this great, once-in-a-blue-moon drug stays with me tomorrow morning.

I guess my point here is this: don't just write off MDMA as a party drug. I still wouldn't recommend it all the time with all the neurotixicity and shit I don't wanna think about right now, now that I think about it (haha), but I cannot overstate the therapeutic effects that I've had tonight.  Stay safe, stay happy, and stay high my enthusiast brothers and sisters.

1376445958.0	1kbl6i	Why does LSD feel so natural?	CocaineKeys	124	25	42	"I have taken a blotter of 400ug.  I just came back from /tripsit and had a nice conservation with Physical. I had to break off and go get eat a Mars ice cream bar because I am not thinking on just one line and I can't keep focused on one thing right now.  
  
What I have noticed from LSD since the first time I tripped is the fact that I was completely off the earth. I got three liquid drops from a friends dropper and just levitated away to everything.  

Within the trip I also forgot what LSD was, actually I even stopped understanding the concept of *drugs* and that I was under one. I believed that when the lights went out that everything would be back to 0 and I would be another life. I had the idea that the whole world was my imagination. Each brand something from my creativity, every country my sub-conscious had created, every person I loved, created by my emotions.  

I started listening to some [liquid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOX67QP75ZY) and remember being one with the music, the music felt like a laser shining through my body, and at around 20 minutes it all began.

I can just recall clear as day that something was telling or showing me that me tripping on this ""mystical natural *something*"" had already happened at one point in my life. LSD wasn't affecting me like a drug, it was bringing be back to the point where my life began, the exact same feeling.  

I went to my bed because I accepted that my time had come and I was waiting for the lights to go out, after five minutes I seemed to remember that I had something that supposedly would make me feel even better, turns out it was MDMA, I dabbed quite the amount and after that I do not remember anything except for; ""if the pillows are on the ground, then we can have a comfortable life"", which was written in my note app.
  
Now a lot of experiences with various substances and here I am on 400ug of LSD, I can just feel it, LSD doesn't seem to be a drug. I have control and I am very aware that I took a drug and that I am experiencing the effects. 

But still, I cannot seem to understand. I am not even exactly sure if I could understand.
  
Okay, this is going to sound stupid, but I actually forgot what is supposed to be written here. I ended with the fact that I may be unable to understand, but now I truly do not understand what I am not supposed to understand.  
  
I think it's best if I leave it as is, thanks for taking your time if you have cached up to me now, please tell me how you think and feel.

Have a great day"	t5_2qh7l	True
