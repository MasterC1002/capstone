1298220216.0	fp0tw	A Dollar Per Vote: Getting Best Use of Your Own	Lochmon	97	29	72	"Welcome back, everyone from [yesterday's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/foo57/why_do_so_many_redditors_rally_against_american/) by [yorrick21](http://www.reddit.com/user/yorrick21), to the ongoing- and probably never-ending-effort for us The Little Guys to have Fair Say in how our society functions.

For anyone new to this ongoing thread, the premise is that it doesn't make sense for people to work hard and earn a dollar and then spend it in a way that works against their own self-interest. We're looking specifically at the idea that, while all corporations pursue best profits, some are more socially responsible and some are more socially toxic.

*We want to know which corporations are the good ones to do business with, and which are the bad ones to be avoided.*

There should be an easy convenient way for us as consumers to make socially-responsible shopping decisions on the fly... and, so, send our dollars to those corporations that do not use their wealth in harmful ways... and further, to deny our dimes as much as possible to any corporation that really is just out to fuck people.

The current concept is to build a website tentatively and awkwardly named ""WikiCorpia"". (I would blame that on someone else if I could.) Anyway... build a website with information on various corporate behaviors so that we, as consumers, can make better-informed decisions about what corporations we want to do business with.

So, *which* corporate behaviors? What *are* the expectations for how a corporation should behave, for us as individuals to call it *socially responsible*... or not?

*That* is what we're here today to discuss. 

(Obviously, people will discuss whatever the hell they want to. But at least we've got a *theme.*)"	t5_2qxhv	True

    ...

""Carter spoke at a forum where an agency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe released its report on last year's U.S. election. The U.S. government invited the European agency to observe the process.""

...

""Carter said that while elections in the United States once set an example for the world, the country's reputation diminished in 2000 when the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in a Florida vote recount, effectively deciding the election in favor of Republican George W. Bush. He also criticized GOP-led state legislatures for changing polling hours in ways that Carter said were meant to frustrate likely Democratic voters.""

""Now, we couldn't wait for the bombs to start raining down on Saddam Hussein. We were all excited. We wanted Saddam to really create problems. 'Do whatever you have to do, set fire to some more oil wells, because the price is going to go higher.' Every broker was chanting that.

I've been in the belly of the beast of at least two ""Medium"" businesses, and have been working in Sales/Marketing for 10 years.  When I first started, I saw the noble glory of providing products that enhance peoples lives for a small profit.  But lately, it just all seems completely made up.  I work my ass off to provide products that are literally designed to fall apart within 2-5 years so that they'll come back and see me again.  Tech firms 'ride' the market and only release enhancements piecemeal so they can sell each upgrade for full price.  We're hopeless profit-junkies and purposely slow down the advancement of the human race so that we can print and hold more and more of this imaginary commodity.  I sometimes feel the idea of money is outdated and we should just grow up and make ""Universal"" quality products.  Like seriously, we COULD be exploring space, but we DON'T because it's currently not ""profitable"", how fucking shameful is that???

So, over the summer I was going to do this summer internship, with a company called The Southwestern Advantage.
It was insane. 
I was suppose to work at least 80 hours a week, 6 days a week from at least 8:29 am to 9:31 pm with as little to no breaks. 
It was going door to door in an area I don't know selling educational materials, living with a stranger host family.
Before I had agreed to do this, I was told it was something else all together. 
I don't have a car so I had to be dropped off by someone else and then work all day till they picked me up at night, other then that I had to walk everywhere and just look out for myself all day since I was by myself. 
My first day out on the job, I narrowly got away from what I found out later to be a registered repeat sex offender who tried to kidnap me. 
I was so shaken up over it I was unable to work the rest of the day. 
I got in serious trouble for this (we had to report our daily stats and I was totally honest about what had happened). 
The next day I was forced to work.
I just completely broke down after the cops interviewed me and explained to me how amazingly lucky I was to have gotten away; they were also amazed this company would send someone to work out there (the worst area of the city) after they had had issues before, much less a tiny girl. 
I'm a college student who has been taking out student loans to try and get by; this job is commission only. 
I called up my parents and they got me a plane ticket home.
I had to beg different people I had met for a ride to the airport and had been chewed out by my student manager about what a loser I was. 
I spent about 300 dollars so far for transportation around the country to do this internship (this is not including my plane ticket home and to a broke college kid, this is alot). 

Once I got home, my mom and I did a thorough investigation into this company; turns out all of these customers have actually complained that this company continued to take money out monthly from peoples bank accounts for a website service along with the educational guides whether or not the customer agreed and it was next to impossible to cancel this forced subscription. 
Now that I've quit the company is trying to get me to pay some stupid fees. 

After this awful experience I have learned my lesson. 
I'm just curious what other experiences people have had with a corporations who pull crap like this. "	t5_2qxhv	True

[-photo-](http://i.imgur.com/nGz6ZJV.jpg)

Now, I've probably lived in four or five apartments in the past ten years. And one thing I've noticed, is that every time I sign up for cable internet, I have to call in to have bogus charges removed.

Every. Damned. Time.

It's always the same one or two items:

1. Internet Modem Lease
2. Home WiFi

Granted, #2 is actually new for me. But it seems to me that it is standard corporate policy to automatically bill people for renting a modem, and now also for renting a router.

Despite the fact that I have my own equipment.

I explicitly told them on the phone that I had my own equipment. I told the tech's when the came out to ""turn on"" my internet (lolz, really guys?) that I had my own equipment. They didn't leave anything here, everything was bought and paid for by me, even the damned coax cable.

Yet somehow, despite all this, without fail, these charges show up.

Once, I can understand. Twice, sure, maybe. But four or five times? In a row?

If anything belongs in /r/greed, it is this. Time Warner Cable is knowingly trying to charge me an extra 11.15% for bogus services. I suspect that they do this to everybody, and that a low percentage of people actually call in to complain about it and have them removed, and therefore they make a profit from the people who don't bother to read their bills. And they can claim it is an honest mistake. Oops. Sorry.

... sorry guys, I'm just pissed off right now. I'm waiting for my ticket to go through some sort of escalation process, and I have no guarantee that they're going to remove those items. The internet modem lease, well, I'm pretty sure they'll get rid of that. But Home WiFi sounds so ambiguous, I bet they could charge me that $5 per month just because I have my own router and am using multiple devices to connect to the internet.

What a croc of shit. ARRRGHGHGHGHHHGHGG!!!

  left to right: giant trashbag full of gourmet pasta sauces, box of cupcake mixes, box of ice cream starter packs.

  I work for a retail company (I'm sure you can guess which one from the pic above), which has recently changed their internal policy. Employees used to be able to take home marked-out goods; not anything expensive, which is sent elsewhere, but low cost items such as chipped ceramics and nearly expired food items. Now everything has to be thrown straight in the trash regardless. 

  I just find the amount of waste created by this new blanket policy is incredulous. Many things that would have gone on to a useful life despite chipping or other cosmetic/shelf life handicaps now go to the landfill. This seems wrong to me, and most of all - greedy. Today just happened to take the cake for me because of the amount of food I had to mark out today, most of which had at least a week or month to go. I imagine this food could have gone to any number of organizations/food pantries/etc. This makes me sad, and I needed to share this somewhere where I don't risk getting fired. Thanks reddit.

Hey fellow Redditors. Here's a bit of a shocker. My Aunt who has decided to purchase a car, went to Shaw GMC. This is the contract they have both signed and agreed upon how the car would be paid off. A couple weeks passed and as my Aunt returned back to Canada (She is a business women, often traveling from Asia to North America), expecting her car to be ready on the 18th of July 2011. Not only was the car not ready after inquiry that morning (No responses either after several messages were left, that is until she complained). They told her to come get it later that day.

     Things were not bad so far. The kicker comes from the final contract that needed to be signed for the car to be 100% hers. The contract she would've signed if she wasn't careful would've increased her interest by about 6 times of what it would've been (If you look at the picture of the contract it clearly states 0.9% for 5 years, the new one had 6.99% for 84 months). Of course this could've been a mistake right?

    Wrong. They increased her payment period from 60 months to 84 months so the bi-weekly payments looked about the same. She would have lost over 4000 dollars had she signed the new contract. They wanted her to sign it quick, to quickly make the first contract she signed null and void. Now they're pulling out all the stops to kill this contract. Latest try today, was when the manger of Shaw GMC called her in (This is after we complained to the Company's Customer Service Ambassador - GM, we had her phone number, name, and everything). After a while of 'discussing' of a solution amongst themselves, the brilliant idea was that my father would be the purchaser and my aunt would be a co-buyer. Of course this required them to sign a new contract, which again would make the first one my aunt had null and void. 

    The reason why they want to kill her first contract is because they themselves screwed up making the first contract. The other contracts offered would have had her pay more to cover up their sorry mistakes. After all this hassle, and no solution, the Manger of Shaw GMC wanted to give my aunt the 500 dollar deposit back and forget about the whole thing. 
    
    So as one can see, their staff not only can lie, but are totally unhelpful when the situation arises. The Customer Service Ambassador - GM, has also told us they are independent from their dealers, so they have no control over their dealers, who sell their cars, and told us their was nothing they could do about it.

Help me spread the word my friends, at how outrageous these turns of events are. I'm helping my aunt spread just how trustworthy Shaw GMC truly is. If they can try to cheat my aunt, why not cheat everyone? Take a stand with me. This kind of act from a large company cannot and should not be tolerated.

You have my thanks.

TL:DR: Don't trust Freakin Shaw GMC, they might lie to you, they might try to cheat you, and there's nothing you can do after. Double check all your future contracts from this bogus company. 

EDIT: We have been to the BBB, but the final straw came today. The manager himself wanted to just throw us back the deposit we paid for the car so it would seem like nothing happened ever. The nerve of these guys. They also have seemed to misplaced the credit information on which my Aunt used to pay for the deposit and had to go back to ask her through email. We are now seeking legal action at the moment. Thank you for all of your support and advice fellow Redditors!"	t5_2qxhv	True

It is unbelievable.  The Supreme Court admitted in a 1980's court case that their land was illegally seized.  Yet the land was not returned to them.

The 'compensation' instead offered to the Lakota for the land was $106 million.  Although impoverished, they described it as analogous to agreeing to sell 'The Wailing Wall'.  They cannot accept the money and so give up all claim to Pe' Sla, which features heavily in their creation stories and is a regular part of prayer vigils and rituals.

The land, which is listed for public sale, will likely be valued at anywhere from $6 million to $10 million dollars.  Thus the Lakota find themselves in the strange position of having to skrimp and save to afford a land that technically already belongs to them; at a price far far lower than the compensation offered to them."	t5_2qxhv	True
