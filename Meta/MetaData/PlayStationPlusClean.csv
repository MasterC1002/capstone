If I could get anything out of this, it would just be direct acknowledgment that these things make us really unhappy. If I could take it a step further, then maybe give us a chance to opt out since a lot of us are long term members. I rather see any of these 2 things happen over getting more AAA/retail games.**

First of all, I know this is a First World Problem &amp; I know that the *overall* value of Plus is stellar. But I need to vent.

A lot has been talked about concerning the comparison of EU Plus to NA Plus. I was actually feeling great about my subscription until a user posted an image [comparing EU to NA since the IGC started](http://i.imgur.com/9L97fKm.jpg). Our highest rated PS3 game (Metacritic score of 90 &amp; above) in the last year has been **PACMAN**. EU had 6 titles above 90, one of those being a double. While we were chomping on pellets EU way playing **Red Dead Redemption, Arkham City, God of War, Okami HD, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus HD, &amp; Mass Effect 3**. We did beat them in one category though: we had twice the amount of games that were rated at 80 or *below*. 6 of which weren’t even rated (Fuseball, anyone?).

[The newest NA offering](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/08/05/ps-plus-august-preview-hitman-absolution-free-for-members-tomorrow/) has a AAA title that EU received in the past, &amp; that's really, really cool. But we're also getting *yet another* PSP fighter pawned off as a Vita offering, a second go-round with Machinarium but this time on the Vita, &amp; another Pinball game. I don't even own a Vita, but I find myself being outraged that they're getting what seems like the 20th fighting game. As far as PS3 goes:

For the month of August, we're getting:

* Hitman: Absolution
* Zen Pinball 2: Star Wars (3 DLC boards for Zen Pinball 2)
* Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien

EU is getting:

* Need for Speed: Most Wanted
* Mafia 2
* Spec Ops: The Line

Those are 3 AAA/retail games EU is getting while we have 1 AAA/retail title along with a couple side games at best. I hear Runner2 is good, but it's a smaller indie title. Which I love getting, but goddamn it's not even close in overall value. I'm aware Europe pays more for games &amp; a bit more for PS Plus, but there's such a large gap in terms of quality. The Vita thing alone is ridiculous. 

Morgan Haro insists he passes on the word of what we think about Plus &amp; what we would like to see from it, but we're getting *another damned fighter* for the Vita. I'm not saying he isn't communicating or that he's to blame, but the PS Plus team clearly isn't taking any hints. So what I'm suggesting is some sort of letter writing/email campaign where we calmly, intelligently, &amp; reasonably express our views. I haven't really thought about the logistics yet &amp; would love to hear some suggestions, but it'll be well thought out. Maybe a ""we the undersigned"" letter/email or... something. This is about the only thing that I can think of that might have a more direct effect than posting on the blog.

**TL,DR:** The difference in quality between NA Plus &amp; EU Plus is becoming greater, especially given the multiple PSP fighting games offered on the Vita. I suggest a more direct approach to this problem with letters or email.

Sorry to bitch, I really am.

---

Edit 1: I'm aware that we got Spec Ops. That isn't the point. The exact title is irrelevant. It's the caliber of game I'm pointing out.

Edit 2: The greater goal here is to get out of the realm of online bitching &amp; in to something where we really are heard &amp; we get a real response. I would still love to hear ideas of effective ways to do this. In the meantime, I'll draft something in the way of a body of text.

Edit 3: I'm not *exactly* saying, ""give us more AAA titles! "". Just don't give us *crap* like Fuse ball, pinball, &amp; repeats on different formats while our EU sibling is getting the cream at the top. And there is a heavy load of bullshit concerning the odd amount of PSP fighting games. At this point it seems like an ongoing practical joke.

If I could get anything out of this, it would just be direct acknowledgment that these things make us really unhappy. If I could take it a step further, then maybe give us a chance to opt out since a lot of us are long term members. I rather see any of these 2 things happen over getting more AAA/retail games.

Edit 4: Some formatting &amp; cleaning up

Edit 5: It was pointed out to me that the Pinball game isn't so much of a game on it's own as it is just 3 boards for the F2P Zen Pinball 2. So we're basically getting DLC instead of a full game on its own.

Edit 6 (huff! puff!): Stop telling me &amp; us that we should not buy it &amp;/or switch to EU like it's a real solution. I thought it was basic knowledge that they won't allow you to cancel. Every PSN purchase is final. Many of us are long term customers &amp; we stack the time when a sale comes about. I'm currently signed up through July 2014 &amp; I bought all this time around Feb 2013. We do this because we have faith &amp; love in the service. But then this happens &amp; we're left feeling underwhelmed, to say the least. I remember Morgan once responding to someone on the blog along the lines of, ""some months just aren't for everybody"". But I feel the problem is bigger than that.

Edit 7: I find it interesting that Morgan hasn't responded to any backlash on the blog. There are currently 5 replies up there between 2 different people &amp; none of them are in response to the anger over getting another fighting game. There's quite a bit of that if you go through the pages. Maybe he's *busy* but it should really be acknowledged."	t5_2u8bb	True

However, some may be worrying about the new PS+ requirement for online play, especially current Xbox owners who may not understand PS+ completely. To past Xbox owners who may be dreading paying $50/year for simple online access, let me fill you in on how PS+ does so much more. Well, not me, but the other redditors who have already explained it so well.

[Here is what a year of PS+ looks like so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dlqok/what_does_one_full_year_50_of_playstation_plus/)

Not bad, eh? And not to mention the PS3 will be getting Uncharted 3, Xcom Enemy Unknown, Saints Row The Third, Machinarium, and other great games this month. 

And [this is the all time list of PS+ games available since the Instant Game Collection started for North America](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/w/list/fullna/). 

On top of that you get early/exclusive access to some betas/demos, can set your Playstation device to automatically update itself by downloading new firmware/game patches while you sleep, backups your gamesaves daily, and gives HUGE discounts. During E3 Tomb Raider and Far Cry 3 are only $20 with [other huge discounts on a variety of games as well](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/).

While it sucks we are loosing the option of jumping in online whenever we want without paying, PS+ provides much more than simple online access. A lot of this information is in the sidebar of course, but this post is dedicated to newcomers.

The fact of the matter is that it is $50(no tax) a year. I started my PS+ in september and I currently have 42 installed games on my hard drive, both free and purchased. I almost never buy a game on PSN unless its on a PS+ sale. To post on that official blog every single week telling them its a horrible services could potentially (99%sure it wont) ruin the service for all of us. Sony as a company should not be given so much flack considering how ""steam-like"" PSN has become which is clearly good for all of us.

### [Sleeping Dogs](http://i.imgur.com/MwBCO42.jpg)

***

&gt; Inspired by classic Hollywood and Asian cinema style action thrillers, Sleeping Dogs is a gritty open-world cop drama set in the vibrant city of Hong Kong. Sleeping Dogs catapults players into the role of undercover cop Wei Shen, tasked with taking down one of the world’s most fearsome criminal organizations from the inside... the Hong Kong Triads. As players explore the bustling and crowded Hong Kong island, through its neon-lit side streets and sprawling street markets, an incredible story unfolds of loyalty and betrayal where Wei begins to question his own motives as he is sucked in deeper than he could ever imagine.

&gt; Offering players an island packed with action, every street corner, market stall, harbor dock or city skyscraper can become an opportunity for intense shoot-outs, adrenaline-fueled street races and intense, brutal martial arts combat. Featuring one of the most intuitive and imaginative combat systems, Sleeping Dogs empowers players to perform an extensive set of martial arts moves, singlehandedly taking on numerous opponents. Players perform bone-crunching kicks and combos, vicious counters and a cinematic set of environmental takedowns making use of countless real-world items from circular saws to phone booths, incinerators to refrigerator doors. 

Sleeping Dogs was first made available to North American PS+ subscribers in May 2013 and European subscribers in February 2013.

The complaints are usually about the quality of the games being offered, and the fact the Europe is receiving higher quality games.

This service is not intended to be the source of all your games forever, as many people are assuming. Its not so that you can get new, AAA titles for a low price. It is so that you can enjoy great games at a cheap price. Many people think that once they have signed up for a subscription, they will automatically get any new game for free, and  that is not the case. Just because it doesn't interest you doesn't mean that everyone else feels the same.

As for the fact that the European version of PlayStation plus is receiving more higher quality games, while I do admit that I wish that was the service I was getting, you need to understand that the people who own the rights to allow the game to be given for free are different for each country. 

Just because one publisher decides its alright to give a copy of the game away, doesn't mean that the other publisher in the other country will.

If you don't like the service and wish to cancel it, by all means go ahead. Make a European account if you want their games. Just don't automatically assume that your opinion of quality and taste for games is the same as everyone else's."	t5_2u8bb	True

Don't get me wrong here though, if a game isn't fun or is too overly difficult/time consuming, I won't bother. But for the most part, I've been trying my best to platinum PS+ games whenever I can. Anyone here feel like me?




EDIT: If I really think about it, I feel like this in general about all games I've downloaded. I guess since downloaded games can't be traded in/resold, I want to play them to the fullest and squeeze everything I can out of them. This doesn't apply to PS+ of course though."	t5_2u8bb	True

To get around it, sign out of PSN before starting the game and sign in only after you're on the main menu (where it says 'new game' and 'load profile'). 

If your PS3 still freezes, hold the power button until system turns off. Don't unplug it.

* On the PS3, I created a new user profile. In the Playstation Store column of XMB there's a register account icon. Go there. 

* Register the new account to an UK address. I just googled a hotel in London and used that address. For my email address I just used my gmail account with ""+UK"" before the @ symbol. (More info on this [here.)](http://lifehacker.com/144397/instant-disposable-gmail-addresses)

* Login to the [Sony Store](http://sonyentertainmentnetwork.com) with your new login ID.

* Go to Wallet &gt; Add funds. From here you can choose to use Paypal. I just added £50.00 to my wallet.

* Sign into the store via your PS3 and purchase Plus.

I'm downloading a few things now. I hope it goes well.

**Edit:** As Yonnzl [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17q5vq/na_thinking_of_getting_an_eu_account_heres_how_i/c87yxml) this is a breach of the Terms of Service and technically you could get in trouble with Sony. Sign up for an EU account at your own risk.

**Edit 2:** A few redditers are having some problems getting this to work. I'm not exactly sure what the problem is. As of 2/17/13 I am still able to add funds and use the UK service normally.

**Edit 3:** It seems as of 03/15/13 the method described above no longer works for adding funds to your Wallet. The work around seems to be this.

Follow the first two steps as outlined above. 

Next go to ~~[game.co.uk]~~ [pcgamesupply.com](http://www.pcgamesupply.com/buygames/sony-playstation-network-cards/) and purchase **downloadable** codes. They seem to be out of actual ps+ membership codes but you can buy ""Wallet Top Ups"" for different amounts. I used my debit card to pay ~~game.co.uk~~ pcgamesupply as I got an error from paypal saying something about paypal not allowing me to ship to the UK. I'm not sure what it meant by that but, my debit card worked fine.

The download code page should appear after the payment is processed(you'll also receive it in an email ). Use this code either on the SONY store web site or through your PS3 PSN Store redeem code section."	t5_2u8bb	True

1372048388.0	1gy7km	My thoughts on Little Big Planet Karting	x23pv	45	11	16	"  I remember several months ago receiving a Little Big Planet Karting beta code. I had seen previews for the title and was eager to check it out. Ultimately the beta left a bad taste in my mouth and I only ended up playing for an hour or so... a month or two later the game releases and not to my surprise it receives less than stellar reviews. And now here I am loving the heck out of it and wondering why I didn't before. See, I downloaded the title from plus not to long ago and just recently beat the story mode. I Absolutely Loved It!!! The track design was bursting with creativity and surprise around every corner, going online I found some highly acclaimed (hearted) levels (including many from that praised kart racer Mario Kart). The only area I found disappointing was the create mode which was too complex for its own good. I would even say LBPK beats out Mod Nation and gives Mario Kart a run for its money. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with how much pure fun I had with the game and encourage everyone to give it at try (after all it's free).

I am growing tired of reading all the negativity in the comments, particularly about the comparison between the EU and NA releases.

The metascore average for NA: 77.25
The metascore average for EU: 80.71

Honestly, we're quibbling over 3%.  We get a great variety of games for a more than fair price, and [we're so quick to talk up PS+](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17p6v2/reasons_why_playstation_plus_provides_a_much/), all just to see a barrage of complaints when we get a **free game (rental, whatever)** *every single week*.

Most of us can't even keep up with the number of games that are given to us, and yet every week, the topvoted comment is inevitably ""Blech, this game sucks. Look at what EU got"".

I've only been a subscriber for a few months, but that's thanks to this subreddit.  I missed Borderlands, which drives me crazy, but I've never complained, because the service is *so damned good*. To me, the main benefit of PS+ is that I'm playing games I never would've thought to check out, and loving it.

I'm amazed at how friendly /r/ps3 is, and yet how argumentative and negative /r/playstationplus is. If I didn't rely on this subreddit for the PS+ info, I would've unsubscribed ages ago.

I don't really have a point, or a goal.  I just felt like it needs to be voiced - we have one of the best online subscription services available in the gaming community.  Let's start acting like it.

Now downvote away, because [that's what downvoting's for](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting).

**tl dr;** Instead of bitching about what EU got, how about you step up and realize the service is awesome, and just say ""better luck next week"".  Or unsubscribe, if you're so unhappy with NA PS+"	t5_2u8bb	True

### [Spec Ops: The Line](http://i.imgur.com/M1Pvy1w.jpg)

***

&gt; Spec Ops: The Line is a provocative and gripping third-person modern military shooter that challenges players' morality by putting them in the middle of unspeakable situations where unimaginable choices affecting human life must be made.

&gt; Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. Once the playground for the world's wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim to a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The city's ultramodern architecture lies half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course of the game.

&gt; While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience ""The Line"", that razor's edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end -- of self and sanity -- when their duty is done and only they remain. 

Spec Ops: The Line was first made available to North American PS+ users in March 2013.

1368672660.0	1efeof	How to Upgrade the PS3 HDD to Larger Size	volpes	32	4	18	"Since it is really easy to fill up your hard drive with the PS+ service, I thought some people would be interested in upgrading.  I just did it, and found it to be pretty low stress.  However, the information you need is scattered all over the place.  I’ll attempt to put everything together here for anyone who is interested.

Steps for upgrading your PS3 harddrive:

1.  Select a hard drive.  The hard drive needs to be a standard laptop/notebook drive that is 2.5” wide and 9.5mm thick.  Pay attention to the thickness, as some of the bigger drives will be 12mm and won’t fit.  It appears that some new 1TB hard drives are being made in the 9.5mm size, but not all of them.  I went with a 750 GB drive instead.  In addition, the connection needs to be SATA, which is pretty standard.  The last consideration is speed.  The drive that comes with the PS3 only runs at 5400 RPM.  A 7200 RPM hard drive will have faster read/write, but will produce more heat.  Since my PS3 already doubles as a George Foreman grill, I chose to keep the slower speed.  This led me to the 750GB WD Blue notebook drive (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136546).

2.  If you want the old data and patches from your old PS3 drive, you will need to back it up.  This means you need a FAT32 formatted USB external hard drive or very large USB thumb drive.  Have an external drive but it isn’t FAT32?  Skip to step 3 (USB thumb drives are probably already FAT32).  Now you are ready to backup the PS3.  Plug in your external drive and go to Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Backup Utility -&gt; Back Up on the PS3 dashboard.  I don’t remember the exact options at this point, but it’s fairly intuitive (e.g. to storage media -&gt; yes -&gt; yes).  Once the PS3 is backed up, you are ready to switch drives.  It is worth noting at this point that there is a list of things that won’t backup--namely trophies and DRM content (see the full list here https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/798/~/ps3-backup-utility).  Trophies should first be synced to the PSN, and DRM content (like downloaded movies) will need to be re-downloaded after you complete the switch.  Skip to step 4.

3.  Reformatting to FAT32.  New versions of Windows will format drives automatically to NTFS.  This file system has some nice security features and large file storage options, but is not as universally compatible as FAT32.  Since the PS3 only accepts FAT32, you will need to reformat.  Before reformatting, you should backup your external drive somewhere else (Yes, I realize I’m asking you to backup a drive so you can use it to backup another drive).  Windows comes with a reformatting tool you can access by cmd prompt, but it can’t handle large drives.  So you’ll need to download a 3rd party utility to do the conversion.  You can find any number of free tools online, but I used this one (http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=304&amp;sid=34) and vouch that it worked fine on my WD external drive.  Run the tool, reformat the external hard drive, then go back to reading step 2.

4.  Physically switching the drive.  First, power down and unplug the PS3 (Does this really need to be said?).  I can’t do any better at explaining this than the official Sony page for it since each model is slightly different (https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/362/~/upgrade-the-hard-disk-drive-(hdd)).  The screws are very soft and very tight, so you will probably strip them if you try to use a screwdriver.  Use some needle nose pliers to work the screws loose, then finish them with a screwdriver or your fingers.  Remove the hard drive tray, remove the old hard drive from the tray, insert the new drive, and reinsert the tray into the PS3.  You might take this opportunity to vacuum out the dust if you haven’t done it in awhile.

5.  Formatting the PS3 drive.  I didn’t have to do this, but Sony’s site says you might.  The prompts are supposed to be foolproof, so I trust you can figure it out if you need to.

6.  Restoring the PS3 backup data.  Now this is getting easy.  Go back through the steps you took to backup the PS3, except this time choose “Restore” instead of “Backup.”

7.  You are ready to play!  If you want to, you can convert your external hard drive back to NTFS and restore its data.  But for most people, you probably won’t even notice any difference if you just restore the data in the FAT32 format.  The choice is yours.

If I skipped any steps or you are confused on something, feel free to post here and I’ll try to help you out.  However, I’m far from an expert at this stuff.  Hope this was helpful to someone!"	t5_2u8bb	True

After the E3 conference and some helpful comments from one of you I decided to jump in and bought three months. I must say that I am amazed... **yet at the same time clearly frustrated about all the games I've been missing out**: games I had wanted to play for years.

Don't get me wrong, this post is nothing but praise for PS+, yet I nearly ""fainted"" when reviewing the list of games that had been available recently. 

First of all I didn't get in time for LBP2, Infamous 2 and Motorstorm... and then there's also Red Dead Redemption, Resident Evil and Okami HD which were available months ago. I'm kicking myself... for only 50€ a year I would have been able to keep my PS3 alive and kicking all this time.

When I first joined I was very skeptical at the time. Games given out were small titles and minis. Lots and lots of minis. A trend was appearing when PS1 classics came about; then IGC. The service has saved me some money on titles I would have bought. A great service by Sony indeed.

I'm coming up on a point in my life where I won't be able to spend much time and money on games (change of job, potentially starting a family), so I'm trying to find the most economical method of keeping my hand in gaming.

I can trade in my 360 and games and get about £174 exchange value and apply it towards a second-hand 500GB Super Slim PS3, which goes for £155. 

I guess my questions are these: a) is it worth getting a PS3 now as it's heading towards end-of-life with the PS4 imminent and b) I think I read that PlaystationPlus wasn't going to be carried over to the PS4 so no freebies will be available? I know that AC4 and the new Arkham will be coming to the PS3, so that'll keep me happy in the short term.

Another tip: games are usually available for free before the store updates. They won't show up in the new arrivals section until after most content is up, though. You'll have to search for the games.

Edit: if you also want to update the demos ( or any games for that matter) ahead of  time through automatic updates, you'll have to play them first. Technically, all this means is that you have to enter the game, press O to cancel the update, and the exit out."	t5_2u8bb	True

First off, I have no idea how long it's been going on, since I just saw the sale yesterday, so my first question is: any idea when it ends?

Also, if I were to buy it, does anyone know how's the multiplayer? I tried looking for subs like r/maxpayne3 or r/maxpayne and they have around 500 people subscribed in each. Needless to say, activity seems extremely low and Multiplayer looked really cool, so I'm afraid it's dead.

Also this decides wether I should buy the standard version or special edition, since the DLC seems to be solely multiplayer, and it wouldn't make sense to buy this extra content if I won't play it.

I don't want to use my credit card info so I'm using prepaid cards, as always, but I don't know when I'll go get one, and I don't want to spend $20 just to have the discount disappear, so that's why I'm asking.

### [Demon's Souls](http://i.imgur.com/3uFitQt.jpg)

***

&gt;  King Allant the XII, the last king of Boletaria, searched tirelessly to expand his might. The Nexus, a great ice shrine nestled in the mountains, bestowed the power of the souls onto him, bringing prosperity to his kingdom. Still unsated, he returned again to the Nexus, where he foolishly awakened the Old One from its eternal slumber. This long forgotten evil, now wrought upon Boletaria, plunged the realm into darkness and fog. A mighty demon horde poured into the kingdom, devouring the souls of men.

&gt; Champions from other realms learned of Boletaria's fate and sought to deliver the kingdom from evil; none would return from the cursed land. Called upon by a mysterious maiden in black, you go forth, the last hope for humanity in a place lost to demons and darkness... 

Demon's Souls was first made available to North American PS+ subscribers in April 2013 and European subscribers in June 2013.

**Clues**

1. ~~A retail PS3 game.~~ ""Big critically acclaimed shooter. Turned the world on its head in terms of what to expect from a shooter."" When the guys joke about it being Inversion, he says, ""Maybe not so literal.""

2. ""Highly acclaimed strategy RPG series coming to the Vita, so look forward to that later in the month.""

3. ""Another great fighter for the IGC.""

4. ""Awesome PSN game that has a highly acclaimed writer. Fairly recently released""

~~So... 1 retail PS3 games, 1 PS3N game, 1 retail/PS3N and 2 PSP/Vita retail games?~~

Edit: On second thought, the shooter and fighter could both be PSN games. The Vita IGC games being retail is just a guess, since I think they're going to be PSP games.

I'll edit in more as others offer what they think will be in. And I'll try to put them in order of how likely they'll be in.

Edit: I added 2 games to the bottom of the list. I also added the Metascore &amp; NA release date to each game.

I still can't believe that for what I used to pay Microsoft just to play online(last xbox RROD'd about 4 years ago), I got 2 great retail PS3 exclusives (LBP2 and Infamous2), some cool arcade games which I've never played (Sideway, Pac-Man DX, Renegade Ops and more) and some of my favorites from recent years which I've already played on PC (Space Marine, Lara Croft, Just Cause and Saints Row 2).

It's also a god-send if you wan't to get a bunch of great local co-op games. I've had a blast playing co-op LBP2, Sideway and Renegade Ops. I haven't finished downloading Ratchet and Clank, but It looks like fun and I would be up for another co-op play-trough of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.

On top of that, you get auto-updating and cloud-saving (awesome) and discounts, full game trials, exclusive betas/services and free themes/avatars (afterthoughts).

I'm really looking forward to what games will be in store for us in the following year and far from being indecisive on whether it was a worthy purchase, it's probably the first time I've gotten so many great games for such a low price.

### [Vanquish](http://i.imgur.com/QGpfWf1.jpg)

***

&gt; The story of Vanquish is set in the near future. Russia and the United States are vying for ownership of the world's fast-depleting energy resources and the US has constructed a space station in order to harness energy from the sun. Russian forces capture this space station and divert its harvested solar energy into a blast wave that destroys San Francisco, aiming to force the US into a total and unconditional surrender. In response, the US tasks its armed forces with recapturing the space station before the Russians can annihilate their next target – New York.

&gt; Players take the role of Sam, a government agent who must stop the threat before it is too late. Armed with a special suit and a plethora of weapons, Sam also has an array of martial arts skills that he can use to take down his robot enemies. 

It was first made available in February 2013 to PS+ users in North America and December 2012 for European users.

### [The Cave](http://i.imgur.com/75rJGRi.png)

***

&gt; The Cave is a 2D puzzle action and adventure game where players will assemble a team of three unlikely adventures that must descend into the mysterious depths to explore locations including a subterranean amusement park and a medieval castle, not to mention a fully armed and ready-to-launch nuclear tipped ICBM.

It was first made available to PS+ users in North America in March and European users in April.

I like to put on my Pulse headset and jam out to tunes while I do chores around the house. The Android app is kinda shit, but once you learn how to stay playlists in offline mode, it gets a lot better.

The catalog is pretty good. Kinda annoying when you can only find the censored version of a song (Xzibit - Get Your Walk On). But I've found most popular artists are on there (it has all of Muse). I wish the channels would be a little better and updated more often. Pandora does a better job at making stations off songs or artists.

One thing I fucking hate is that when you're browsing songs in the ps3 app, if you select an album while a song is playing, it will stop that song and start playing the album. Annoying when you're partying and someone wants to look up a song to play next.

I wish I kept my receipt for verification, but it's at home &amp; I won't be back all weekend. I can tell you for sure it works. In fact, you might want to not mention to them that there's a promotion &amp; just let it print on your receipt. It expires Sunday, June 2nd!

Now why would you wanna consider stacking some time? With the PS4 on the horizon, [they might be changing up the Plus program to a tiered service.](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps4-playstation-plus-could-have-silver-gold-and-platinum-membership-tiers) It is unclear how Plus will work on the PS4 (surely they won't give us a free retail game on day 1... would they?), but it's said to have a [""prominent role""](http://www.gamespot.com/news/playstation-plus-will-have-prominent-role-on-ps4-6404683) on the 4. *This is purely speculation on my part*, but I'm willing to bet they'll grandfather in current Plus subscribers to the top tier of whatever this new structure might be. Plus users are extremely happy &amp; the program has been getting a lot of great press. I see Sony continuing their stellar service in not only keeping us happy but locking in our dedication. This certainly is a way to do that.

I'm sure the terms of service has them covered that you agree that if this ever occurs, you lose access to your plus library but really, what do you think would happen? 

Do you think Sony would just gift you your plus library to your bought games list to save face or do you think they would actually pull the TOS card?

I honestly think the plus program is doing well and will continue on to the next gen system so i'm not worried, just curious to read what you guys think could happen in this situation.

EDIT: Just wanted to point out that the point of this post was to discuss opinions on a hypothetical (not pointless Icebreak) but very possible situation. Was wondering what other people thought about it. No need to say that i'm paranoid or try to say that I don't understand the TOS or that it's a subscription. I understand what the service is. I understand that it's subscription  paid access to perks and content. Seltox hit it right on the head when he said ""No matter how unfounded it would be, there would be a public outcry."" This is why I opened communication about it. I'm not worried, just curious what you guys think should/would happen if plus stopped. Would sony just stop everything or try to save face somehow? End all be all, I am %95 sure plus will continue on PS4. I'm hoping all content will work on ps4 but who knows, there may be issues with relicensing content for another system though i'm sure Sony has that handled in the current plus licensing contracts.

### [Pac-Man Championship Edition DX](http://i.imgur.com/zGSe7CN.jpg)

***

&gt;  Celebrating the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man and following up on the 2007 award winning title, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX bolsters the beloved arcade formula by offering even more sophisticated mazes, modes, and enhancements. It'll be a celebration for fanatics and a new generation of players alike. Building upon PAC-MAN Championship Edition’s original six courses, the new game features more than 100 varied and mind-boggling mazes to navigate. Several new modes will also be available to test a player's pellet-munching aptitude. In Time Attack Mode, players will vie for the quickest clear time. Fulfill a series of objectives in Mission Mode or compete to devour the most number of ghosts gobbled in Ghost Mode.

&gt; With brand new visual variations and music, plus all the great features found in the first PAC-MAN Championship Edition including mazes that dynamically change shape during gameplay, PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX is a game worthy of the rotund hero's 30th birthday. 

Pac-Man Championship Edition DX was first made available to North American PS+ users in July 2012.  It is currently the highest Metacritic-rated PSN title given out on PS+ even earning a rare perfect 10/10 from IGN.

I recently tried to buy playstation plus and found that my credit card number was out of date.

So, in order to reset my password I apparently need my date of birth, which I don't recall providing and doesn't work.

So to cut a long story short, PSN support are flatly refusing to assist without a scan of my passport (something that's actually illegal for them to request in this country) and I'm unwilling to provide.

If I create a new account a buy PS+ with it, will there be any downsides? Is anything about PS+ user-specific or is it all system specific?

I already have Plus, for the PSVita that I own. I would consider giving up the Xbox that I have, as I have to purchase games for it, if the Plus library would be significant enough to give me plenty to play.

&gt;  LittleBigPlanet 2 empowers users to create their own levels by utilizing a variety of developer tools as well as various games like top-down racing games, multiplayer shooters, flying side-scrollers, RPGs and more. The game begins with a unique story mode that provides a beautifully reshaped world for Sackboy to explore and play. Each story level is influenced by cultural high points in history.

&gt; Players can reset the controller buttons for any object and change the rules to any level through an ability called Direct Control and multiplayer abilities advance the types of games possible for a social/competitive experience.

### [Lord of the Rings: War in the North](http://i.imgur.com/C28i6PA.jpg)

***

&gt; Unseen lands from the world of Middle-earth are awaiting in this visceral action-adventure RPG. The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is set against the backdrop of the famous trilogy, yet forges its own distinct path with a new story and an exciting take on the popular genre. It gives players the unique opportunity to explore previously untold stories in the realm of Middle-earth during the journey of the ring. Innovative cooperative gameplay pits you and your friends against the dark forces of Middle-earth. 

Lord of the Rings: War in the North was first made available to PS+ users in Europe April 2013.

Just kind of tired hearing this same little rants by random people when I see someone mention the free games they got and then someone who has nothing to add to the conversation and just say, ""but they arent free.""  Its like they think they are educating someone by letting them know they aren't free, just think that's stupid.

Please don't upvote.

Sorry for asking this kind of questions, but... 

So I want to get PS+ but I'm curious about how it works.

When I select ""Free Games"", I get Sleeping Dogs(I'm in EU), LBP2, inFamous 2 and some other games.

But If I browse the store, I can find several other free games for Plus members like Deus Ex and Mortal Kombat.

Are those some kind of left overs from past months? Will I be able to play them if they're not in the current ""Free"" list?

How long they will be there? I've read what PS+ is getting new games as early as 6th of March. Or there is some games which are always free for PS+?

Also I've heard what I can download the free game and it will be available for me as long as I'm subscribed to PS+, even if the game is not free anymore, is that true?

Thanks!

SiriusC	21	10	44	"With today's outlook on the EU March update being **so** great it once again leaves NA users longing for better quality in titles. Sure, we don't know what March has in store for us yet (&amp; we won't until the last week of March), but the general consensus seems to be there's too great a difference in quality between the two.

Over the last couple of months we got good games like Vanquish, Darksiders, RE5, &amp; BioShock 2. But they're not Mass Effect 3, Sleeping Dogs, Arkham City, or Red Dead Redemption. Besides RE5 &amp; BioShock 2 (which EU also got), I had to look up Vanquish &amp; Darksiders because I've never heard of them before. I can appreciate them on some level, but they're not the *complete motherfuckin' aces* EU is getting.

So... when you look at the content we get from the perspective of what you get, what do you think? Are we right to bitch &amp; moan? Should we just be grateful for what we have? Or is it reasonable to be a little envious or even outraged?"	t5_2u8bb	True

What I've been running into, and what I need your help with is setting it up so that when I get a new game from the IGC and put it in my downloads list that the system will not only download and install the game, but that it will also download and install the latest game patch.

My main one is the EU account and this is where I subscribed to PS+.

So now the question - do i just keep the money there? do i buy stuff on the PSN store to that amount or should I top it to 50USD and get another PS+? 

The value of PS+ seems to be much higher than whatever i could get for 23 or even 50 usd and there is enough difference between the offering on both to make it an interesting option...

The graphics are PS2-like with all kinds of glitches &amp; the it's not exactly action-packed or immediately gratifying. You have to have &amp; good amount of patience to admire any sort of pay off.  Plus... name value? To be honest, I never heard of XCOM before its entry into the IGC. But that's probably due to me being out of the video game scene for a good chunk of time from 2008-2012.

Again, I love this fucking game &amp; I can't stop thinking about it when I'm at work. How I'll go about doing certain things &amp; how I'll customize my characters.

Most of the flack for this games comes from it being not a ""true Resident Evil"" game. Which I totally feel. As a huge RE fan, I HATE that it's not a good **RESIDENT EVIL** game. The fact that I'm in a fire fight with the baddies pisses me off. I hate the leveling up &amp; inventory system, but that's because I loved RE4's so much. I have plenty of disdain towards it, believe me.

But that doesn't mean it's not a *good game*. The graphics are beautiful, it's action-packed, &amp; the two player aspect is a BLAST! Leon's campaign is closest to classic RE. My girlfriend &amp; I played through it &amp; there's a graveyard/church portion where she screamed 3 times. The Ustanak is as frightening as Nemesis. And there's a portion of Jake's campaign where the two players are in totally different sections &amp; have to help each other out via cameras &amp; video turrets. So it's not just 2 players running through levels gunning bad guys down. The separation of the campaigns is really unique too. I'm usually a fan of the story in any game &amp; this is the most unique way a story has been told in any video game I've ever played. And each campaign has good distinction between them in game-play rather than just story that keeps each one fresh. There's a good amount of cool B games within it too, including Agent Hunt where you get to take control of the enemies &amp; give players hell. Lots of unique things like this.

TL;DR - RE6 for $15 is a steal. "	t5_2u8bb	True

### [Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception `(Single-Player)`](http://i.imgur.com/8whY83N.jpg)

***

&gt; Fortune hunter Nathan Drake is catapulted headlong into an adventure that takes him on a daring trek into the heart of the Arabian Desert in a search for the fabled ""Atlantis of the Sands."" This journey pits him and his mentor Victor Sullivan against the occult treachery of a shadowy clandestine organization and its ruthless leader. When the terrible secrets of this lost city are unearthed, Drake's quest descends into a desperate bid for survival that strains the limits of his endurance and forces him to confront his deepest fears. 

Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (Single-Player) was first made available to PS+ subscribers in North America and Europe in June 2013.

1375768160.0	1jsmzi	Perspective [Editorial]	IceBreak	23	11	18	"Today has reminded me of the folks on NeoGAF cancelling their PS4 pre-orders because a hypothetical gig of RAM theoretically wasn't available.  ""I've had it"" means I'm done with the service.  But most of your complaints aren't with the service.  They are with the fact that another region gets a better version of the service.  I'll admit, I was personally disappointed with this month's selection.  Mostly in ZEN DLC being counted as a game more than anything.  

But at $4.18 per month, NA PS+ is still a tremendous value.  If you don't like the way things are, don't renew and get EU PS+ or sign up for the Xbox service Games with Gold.  If you aren't happy, as we see every month in comments no matter what's given out, then speak with your wallets.

Personally, I'm happy with a retail game, two PSN games, a Vita game, and a PSP game monthly.  It sucks EU gets a smorgasbord and NA doesn't but I try to have a little perspective (and being locked in for six more years doesn't hurt)."	t5_2u8bb	True

1371157813.0	1galz8	[NA] Downloaded Uncharted 3, only multiplayer shows up	MrSumOne	19	10	23	"Hey,


I downloaded this HUGE game (something like 50GB!!!), and when I turned on my PS3 the next day, only the multiplayer free to play is there. Living in Canada, I have pretty lousy bandwidth restrictions, and I checked my usage on my ISP's site, I'm pretty much now at my cap for the rest of the month. So I downloaded something, can someone help me find where Uncharted is? Otherwise I have to hope that they'll keep it on PS+ until the end of the month, and my cap resets.

I checked the game data, there's a Uncharted 3 data, 213kb, and additional content, 36gb. Maybe I can only download the single player somehow?"	t5_2u8bb	True
1370996205.0	1g5tjk	Japanese PS+ Instant Game Collection &amp; More	JPN_Plus_Info	13	3	2	"For those unaware, as I was a few days ago, the Japanese PS+ has been undergoing a facelift and they currently have a very decent offering. Their pricing structure is very friendly for short-term memberships because unlike the US and EU stores, the Japanese store has no 3-month option. Their choices are ¥5000 for a year, or ¥500 for 30 days. The latter makes it very easy to give their service a try. I wanted to learn more, but noticed there wasn't really a good chart anywhere showing what the Japanese PS+ has to offer so I thought I'd make one for myself and anyone else out there with a Japanese account who might care to see it. 

I reorganized the data from their [official PS+ listing page](http://www.jp.playstation.com/psn/plus/list/) mainly to get a quick look at what's available and what's expiring when. I included some info about each game like the filesize and the listed price to be able to guess which 'class' the game belongs to and what kind of game it's likely to be replaced with. For example, Birds of Steel was put up a few weeks ago, is only up for a month, and it is the only full-size Platinum-trophy-packing PS3 game in the list, all of which gives me the impression that when it expires in a week a similar 'class' game will replace it (though nothing is certain).

Some extra things - the CERO ratings are like Japan's ESRB. A is for all ages, like *E for Everyone*. B is for ages 12+, similar to *T*. C is rated for 15+, which is right between ESRB's *T* and *M*. And D is 17+, which is equivalent to an *M*. 

The columns on the right show which dates you can still obtain the game freely as a PS+ member. The Japanese PS+ is updated once a month in the middle of the month. The current period ends on June 18, and that will be the last day you can get the games which are marked # in its column. The next day all these games (#) are removed and the store is updated with new stuff so it makes sense to say that *the ideal time to buy the monthly pass is a few days before the end date*. By this time, the next month's new additions should be announced and you get a last-chance to pick up the games on their way out, giving you almost a month to enjoy two months worth of content. 

So, without further ado here is the list of the current Japanese PS+ roster:

Bonus information: according to the Japanese PS+ site, Sony seems to be having a PS+ promotion next month where they will give everyone 15 days of Japanese Plus for free. The last day of the promotion is 7/16 so the perfect time to activate the free offer would be 7/13-7/15. 

I think it's worth mentioning that if you're not in Japan, using Japanese PSN isn't fully kosher. Sony hasn't been too strict about foreign users creating JPN accounts and I hope we can keep it that way. And as a disclaimer, this post is primarily for those who already have Japanese PSN accounts and can at least comfortably navigate Japanese menus. A lot of these games are language-intensive and so even 500 yen might not be worth it if most of the games are unplayable due to the language barrier. There are a few games you can enjoy without knowing much Japanese, but even those require hiragana/katakana understanding so if that's missing take this as a fair warning heads up - getting lost in menus and indecipherable text would not be what I'd call a fun time.

As for funding your account if you happen to be outside of Japan, there's a great easy to find site to buy Japanese PSN codes online which I won't mention by name because that's not what this is, but you shouldn't have a hard time finding it. Their prices were the cheapest and they emailed me the code within an hour. Good luck.

1370531842.0	1fsly1	[EU] Problems with the subscription to the PS Plus	pabl8ball	15	4	5	"Hi everybody! 
I don't know if this is the right subreddit but still.....

After getting many informations (especially here) I've decided to do the 90 days submission to the PS Plus but; surprise surprise, Sony doesn't want my money....
The problem is that Sony don't let me add some money on my wallet, it says that the card data (name, address, card number, etc, ) are wrong, which of course they are not.... I have a prepaid card of my country's postal service, (which is under the ""Visa Electron"" circuit) but I don't think that is the problem since I've used it without any issues both on amazon and steam.
I'm from Italy.

Currently playstation Retail Loyalty Site is doing a number of giveaways for finishing modules. Two of them give you codes for the new Soul Sacrifice game on the Vita. I am requesting an member the loyalty program that has no interest Soul Sacrifice send me the codes so that I can run a giveaway in r/vita. I have already given away the spare code I received and would very much like to be able to give away more to those fans who did not have the foresight to preorder the game. The contest I plan on running will use freerice.com and the users with the largest amount of rice donated will get a code. I will do this until I have run out of codes.

Also ALL GAMESTOP EMPLOYEES! If you are not signed up for the playstation Retail Loyalty Site do it now! You get a free year of playstation plus!

For those who don't know playstation Retail Loyalty Site is a site for people who work at retail stores that carry sony products. It is awesome, they give you free/discounted products and it is fabulous!

I'm sure it happened because me and my friend were talking over Skype about it, we tried re-logging (assuming it was a bug) and it was still there so he went ahead and purchased it.  
I, on the other hand, claimed that ""it's still too early for my subscription to end"" and now regret it and want to punch myself in the face.. especially that I only have 90 days left..  

It was something around 20$ in my EU store.  
____
**Edit:** it appears his subscription ends in October.. and since he had one month left before he got the offer then most probably the offer was in September or somewhere in between August and October.  

Now, seeing as there was no confirmation from anyone here kind of brings some suspicions I had..  
- the sale wasn't announced and *may* not be announced again.  
- it lasted for a ~~very~~ short time.. around 4 days or so (I thought it was 1 day but friend said it was more like 3-4 days).  
- it could've been *exclusive* to some stores/regions. Though I doubt it I didn't want to exclude it.  

I managed to get a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3xR9IQe.jpg?1) (warning: literally) of the purchase message that's showing the exact date and price `(thanks to FTomato for bringing it to my attention)`.

For example. Let's say the new Cod:Ghosts was finished a month before the release date. Sony could release the game in a locked state on PSN a week before to let people download it and when the release date arrives the game automatically unlocks itself. I think that this would be a nice feature to have considering that some games can be up to 20gb and that it would be more convenient for those with slow download speeds to download the game before hand and play it at launch without spending time to download and install it.


This has happened with Tales of Xillia which was in the psn store for a little while because of an error and Sony quickly fixed this by locking the game.

Is there a way to say which region has it better? Had one of them had noticeably better deals so far?  Does one have better prices on games?(...)

I'm European, so far I am leaning towards the US account simply because it seems that most games sold in my country that have any downloadable content attached to the game require the US account (because they are probably some sort of ""US copies"", god knows why). 

On the other hand the EU PS+ currently has, according to your sidebar, 2 games for free that I'd be very much interested in (UC3 + Demon's Souls) while the US one only has UC3.

Another cool thing is games cost about 2500 Rupees, that converts to 42 dollars or 32 euros!

So, from what I can tell, games are available for a certain amount of time and then they are unavailable, right?

• The bar at the side of this Subreddit shows the new games added each month, right? Where can I see what games are *currently* available? I want Gravity Rush… And Uncharted…

•My friend has a PS Vita. For Jet Set Radio, which according to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/15esms/december_24th_ps_update_details_for_north_america/) won't be available through Instant Game Collection after December 31, is there a way I can sign into my PSN account on my friend's Vita, and buy the game (for $0.00, right?) so I'll have access to it after I get my Vita? Or are the accounts tied to a specific system?

Actually, now that I'm here, I have two other PlayStation general questions, maybe you guys can help.

• I don't have a PS3, and I know nothing about Uncharted. Do I need to know any story for the Vita Uncharted game?

• So… Cross Buy. Is Cross Buy tied to a PSN account? My friend and I are splitting the cost of Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for the PS3. Can I have the Vita version while he keeps the PS3 version, even though we have different accounts?

Here are my questions: 

- I'm from Europe and he'll be in Argentina. Is the ""one account on two PS3 systems"" option valid over such a huge distance? Isn't Sony going to complain?

1350671734.0	11rdq6	Do PS+ owners ever actually buy physical games, or are the freebies enough?	rand486	15	7	30	"In a world where I work a 9-5 job, spend 10-15 hours a week at the gym, social responsibilities, and just general life responsibilities, I only get about 2-3 hours a week to play video games these days.

I'm envious of PS+ owners, because it seems like you're always drowning in more games than you can play.  I've been toying with just biting the bullet and getting PS+, rather than my current system, which is to wait for boxing day, and take advantage of the used game discount EB always has, to get the last year's best titles.

I end up spending about 100-120 dollars for about 8 used games.  I feel like PS+ would be cheaper, but games like FF13-2, Skyrim (God, I still haven't played it, and I'm dying), and other big titles probably won't ever hit PS+.

Do you feel it would be worth going to PS+, or should I stick to my current system, given my lack of time to game?  I doubt I can justify doing both - it's already mid-October, and I've only beaten 3 of the games I bought from last Boxing day...

**tl dr;** I can only game ~3 hours a week. Would PS+ be worthwhile, or should I just keep buying used games for cheap a year or two after they come out?"	t5_2u8bb	True

### [Uncharted: Golden Abyss](http://i.imgur.com/Ujve12Y.jpg)

***

&gt; Uncover the dark secret behind the 400-year-old massacre of a Spanish expedition as Nathan Drake follows the murderous trail of an ancient and secret Spanish sect in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Caught in the middle of a rivalry between Jason Dante -- his old friend -- and Marisa Chase -- the granddaughter of an archaeologist who has mysteriously vanished without a trace -- Nathan Drake races into the treacherous river basins, undiscovered temple ruins and karst caverns of Central America in search of a legendary lost city, only to find himself pushed to the edge of the Golden Abyss.

&gt; Developed by award-winning Sony Bend Studio, Uncharted: Golden Abyss is the portable system debut of the multi-million selling Uncharted franchise. The game offers a cinematic experience on-the-go complete with industry-leading motion capture, a rich storyline, highly-detailed environments, and special effects that truly captures the look and feel of the Uncharted universe. 

Uncharted: Golden Abyss is currently the best-selling game of all-time for the Vita and one of just three to retail over for more than $40 at release.  It was first made available in November 2012 to PS+ users in North America and Europe with the launch of the Instant Game Collection for Vita.

When I plugged in my working PS3, I had to format the hard drive. I eventually logged in and set up my account. When I go to check my saves on the cloud, not all saves are appearing. It says I have 651 MB / 1024 MB left, but it only shows 30 saves from 23 games. The games I am mostly looking to import are Hitman: Absolution, Far Cry 3, and Rock Band 3. Is it an issue with these games, or is it PS+? I am positive I set these games to auto-upload, as I played them very frequently and saw that they had been uploaded daily.

We also have PS+ so we have those games too. What I'm wondering is if games bought on the master account transfer down to the sub accounts so that we can play LBPV together (It requires 2 different accounts), and if PS+ also transfers down the line from master accounts to sub accounts so we can still have those games as well.

One of my biggest gripes about the current generation of consoles is that developers seemed to eliminate local splitscreen 2 (or more) player games. I don't care about online multiplayer myself (though I know many people do, which is why I'm suggesting columns for both forms of multiplayer), but I'm always looking for games that I can play with friends in the same room when they come over. Since the free games are all downloads and we don't have a box to look at to see what the online and other features are, I feel like this would be helpful. Just my two cents.	t5_2u8bb	True

Does anyone know the specifics or of a dev that went on IGC and explained their financial experience with it?"	t5_2u8bb	True

I don't think they've had a major PS3 title that wasn't ""M"" rated in the IGC in North America since last fall.  Only the smaller PSN games have been suitable for younger players.  While I understand that there are lots of great ""M"" rated games, I wish they'd include a major Teen or younger rated game at least every two or three months.  This would help the service appeal to a broader audience including families.  Likely a couple of the core titles coming next week won't be ""M"" rated, but they need more of the non-M titles throughout the year."	t5_2u8bb	True

I'm asking mostly because I get motion sickness when I play first person shooters. I get dizzy playing things like unchartered 1. I was moving along a river trying to get out. I move my stick but the guy didn't move. Instant sickness ugh.

I feel like it's a bit of a waste if I don't get everything but I also feel like I'm hoarding games I can't play to begin with.

My PS3 YLOD. I then stripped it down to the motherboard and put it in the oven at 430 degree. After that, it now turns on but I know it's not going to last. I backed up everything I could to a USB stick, but some games (Woods 14) are not able to copy because of EA (argh!) 

My friend has a PS3 slim and said he would give it to me. If I get a ps+ account (I don't have one) could I then backup games to the cloud on my PS3, and then grab them from his PS3?

### [Just Cause 2](http://i.imgur.com/JIGGPGP.jpg)

***

&gt; Just Cause 2 stars Rico Rodriquez, back to wreak havoc once again, this time with a new destination -- the huge playground of the South East Asian islands of Panau. The sequel features more stunts, vehicles and weapons than ever before and an incredible overhauled grappling hook system. 

&gt; Panau itself is an incredibly detailed and vast 1000 sq km game world of different climates and ultra-realistic weather effects. Leap from your plane and skydive from 10,000 feet down into a tropical jungle, tear across an arid desert in a dune buggy or climb your way up a snowy mountain in a 4x4. The vast open-ended, unique gameplay is back, allowing you full freedom once again to free roam and explore the massive world of Panau and tackle your assignments however you want. 

It was first made available to PS+ users in North America in June 2012 and European users in August 2012.

There were about 15 games available for free right when I activated my account, and I purchased all of them, but I've only downloaded the two that I want to play right away. I may have a hard time remembering which ones I've bought if I don't keep a list. 

Second, if you already have a game on disc and it becomes available on ps+, can you switch from one to the other? I already have Infamous 2 on disc, but it's available on ps+ as well for free.

If I sign up for PS+, I won't be able to download all the free games because they won't all fit on the memory card. I know the free games change on a regular basis, but once you've downloaded one of them you keep it until your subscription is canceled. 

So, how can I keep access to all the free games without downloading them all at once? If I download Uncharted and delete it, and Sony takes Uncharted off the free games list, will I still be able to download it for free, or will I have to pay to download it again -- if I am still a subscriber? 

Thanks!


EDIT:

Just saw this at the bottom of the FAQ:

TIP:
To save HDD/memory card space, you only need to ""buy"" a game (at $0.00) to access it later (not download it).

I guess that answers my question? I don't even need to download / delete a game, just ""buy"" it, and I can download it anytime I want in the future, even if it's removed from the instant game collection? Effin' sweet.

After looking around online some people mentioned that it took around 24 hrs after they viewed 90 minutes, at which point they would receive an email confirming the address for the code to be sent.

Since it's been a few days I got on the NowTV live chat with a rep and asked for the email.  The rep said to receive the code I'd have to wait for the trial to finish, then make a payment for another month and only then the code will be sent.  I don't remember reading that anywhere.

As I've seen a few redditors mention they have already received the code in the post could you confirm that you had to make a payment after the trial for another month.  Also, it'd be great if someone could find the T&amp;C's for the offer as I can't find it anywhere and the rep was also struggling to find it.

Edit: So apparently I got it resolved.  The live chat rep wasn't helpful at all with that misinformation, after asking to speak to a manger she went back on what she originally stated and said that I would receive it within the free trial period.  The whole thing seemed pretty dodgey to me as she replied with that whole having to pay for an extra month thing pretty quick.  Either way, lets see what happens now.

* Ridge Racer (Vita)
* Shinobido (Vita)
* Tekken 5 DR (PS3)
* Tekken 6 (Vita)
* Uncharted Golden Abyss (Vita) [This has been since forever]

I could only blame my own decision couple of years back before PS+ was introduced when I created my account. Couple of years on, along with a few Platinums, the option to simply switch to a different account are no longer an option.

The MP is downloadable by everyone, so how do I get a ""full"" MP experience? I didn't see a multiplayer full option. My guess is that after I finish downloading the Single Player I won't be treated as a F2P. So, am I right?

EDIT: Hopefully it's not too difficult to understand, I guess it's a slightly complex issue unless you have experience with language specific titles.


----

For those who are wondering:

The thing is in Europe, there are a lot of games, (Call of Duty for example), which are language locked, so even in Switzerland, you buy an Italian version, German version or French version (separate disks), with no ability to change the language settings in-game. 

Other games, like FIFA aren't language specific and let you choose the language before loading up. There are even more games that immediately use the language setting of your PS3 (in my case English).

If I buy Episode three, will I be able to play it once my first two episodes ""Expire"" With my playstation plus? It seems as though there is some issue here.

I would hate to pay full price for the full season when i have played and somewhat owned the first two installments."	t5_2u8bb	True

### [Double Dragon Neon](http://i.imgur.com/NZppw6P.png)

***

&gt; Fight as twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee on an exciting adventure to save their shared love interest, Marian from the evil Skullmageddon across 16 brawling levels filled with elaborate missions, malicious enemies and over-the-top battles.

&gt; Double Dragon: Neon is the reinvigorated update to the 80's beat'em up smash hit that is reminiscent to the original. Trained by their sensei in the special form of martial arts called Sōsetsuken, Billy and Jimmy are equipped with lethal combat skills and weaponry to bust some faces and battle the baddest goons around as they journey across the galaxy to rescue the love of their lives. 

Double Dragon Neon was first made available to North American and European subscribers in September 2012.

This seemed like a great suggestion to me. I've been  interested in trying ps+, but none of the NA ps3 games are of interest to me, conversly I've been meaning to try Catherine for a while and the EU version is currently offering it. Unfortunately, after struggling through problems with home to get the code, I found that you need to have a credit card tied to an EU address to use it. 

Predictably, I have no such card. This leaves me wondering if there is a way to bypass or fake this requirement. Alternatively, I have also been wondering if the original poster was talking about a different code.

Also does this mean the game is ""saved"" twice on my HDD?  As in is it taking up double space since its downloaded and installed?  Noob question I know.  I am just a little confused.

Also is there a way to auto install when downloading? I think i remember seeing that option with PS plus somewhere but I really suck at navigating XMB.

I have one problem though, I'm stuck with the same 40GB HDD that came with my PS3 at the moment (until I pick up a new, much biggererer HDD).

Anyways, I'm new to all this, but from what I've read about Plus is that the Instant Game collection games are only available for a month, before disappearing and a different bunch of games becomes available for a month. Am I right so far?

I also heard that as long as I download a little bit of an instant game collection game, It's mine forever (or until I stop paying for PS Plus). So theoretically, I could download 1% of Uncharted 3, stop the download, then in a years time resume the download and install the game? Hoping this is right because it sounds awesome if it's true. I'll probably even download a little bit of loads of Vita games, in case I ever buy a Vita.

And, finally, obviously with my tiny 40GB Hard Drive I can't really fit any games on it, I can't even attempt to download Uncharted 3 for example as I don't have 12GB free space. However after attempting to download Uncharted, underneath the download link, where it would say ""~~£39.99~~ +Free"" it now says ""Purchased"". Am I right in thinking that because it says it's purchased I can download the game entirely in a couple months time when I get my new HDD? Bear in mind I haven't even started downloading it as it wouldn't let me. If it's mine forever just by clicking to download it I'm just going to get everything then download them all when I get my new Hard Drive.

Thanks for any help guys."	t5_2u8bb	True

When the game is no longer available I see someone crosses out the game.  So couldn't see it that would add that much more work then whats already being done.

I ONLY ever use a sub-account (Friends, trophies, game content, Vita sync etc)
My sub account NEVER allows me to purchase anything from the PS store, I always just go to the Master account and purchase the item and it is available in my sub account as well.

That is what I did tonight, went to my Master account spent the $50 and went back to my sub account, only to realize the PS+ icon wasn't next to it....
tried to copy and paste the saved data from my sub account to the Master and figured I would just bite the bullet and lose ALL of my trophies (which would SUCK, but a lot less than tossing $50)

I'll try to keep them realistic. dmc is very likely to come soon, along with 'imo' ps all stars. dmc was rumoured to be august, and all stars  has seen a price drop and been on sales many times. also, i can imagine fifa 13 coming before fifa 14, as ea seem quite happy to see their titles on plus, bf3, nfs etc. other games which may be likely are tomb raider and farcry 3. tomb raider is published by square enix, sleeping dogs had a plus release within a similar gap from release, so it's possible. farcry 3, just because it'd fit well and hitman has already been released on plus, from around the same retail release period.

Fighting games are something I'm really passionate about so I thought ""hey, finally something I can contribute about to one of my favorite subreddits.""

I know that some of these deals are over, but for those of you that downloaded a game and haven't played it yet, or did a quick purchase, I hope that I can help you decide if a game is worth your time. This list is only for the Vita, if people are interested in one for the ps3 games I'd be glad to do that too.


If you are not interested in reading about what I feel are the good parts and bad parts of a bunch of fighting games, thanks for reading this far, but you can stop reading now. 

Before I talk about the games themselves, I want to say the vita is great for fighting games. The buttons and d-pad respond well and feel good. I used to only play on an arcade stick so I was worried. The vita feels 50x better than the ps3 controller, so if you've had a bad experience with the ps3 controller I suggest you still give it a chance. 


So far for the Vita the following fighting games have been free:

Tekken 6

Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny

BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend




1. Tekken 6

I have been a fan of the Tekken series for a long time. The first that I played was T2, and I've played each game since then. If for some reason you are wondering, I liked 3 and 5, but not really 4. I happened to be in Japan when T6 came out in arcades, played it and loved it. Bought it as soon as it came out for ps3. Got a character card and played at arcades a lot. I was a little hesitant about the PSP/Vita version at first, but it was free so I figured hey, what the heck. 


***The Good Things***

1. Tekken 6 has some really nice controls. If you haven't played Tekken games before, they are not command input driven like Street Fighter/King of Fighters/etc, but rather rely on exact timing of button pushes to form long combos. Tekken 6 I feel improved on the already fluid and satisfying controls of Tekken 5.

2. Increased the character roster. There are a lot of unique characters, so you can experiment around and see who fits your play style best.

3. Simple but deep. Tekken uses only 4 buttons, left and right punch, and left and right kick(along with combinations of those for throws and other attacks). It's easy for a beginning to jump in and have fun, but incredibly deep once you start to really get into it

4. Character customization. There is so much stuff you can buy to make your character look how you want. There is funny stuff, cool stuff, sexy stuff, etc, and they items can be unlocked by playing the game so you don't need to spend real money

5. Load times. Load times are far shorter than the PS3 version. 

***The Not as Good Things***

1. Graphics not as good as the ps3, but not bad. 

2. No online play. This was the biggest disappointment for me. I know Tekken 6 is an older PSP game, so I don't hold it against it, but it is definitely a turn off.

3. Saving up money can be tedious. Everything in the shop, even small stuff, is really expensive. Be ready to ply a lot. 

4. Less modes and less costumes. A few modes were taken away from the ps3 version

**Verdict:**

If you like Tekken 6 a lot, or have friends with psp/vitas, you should definitely not miss this. That being said, if you are like me, and the only person in your friend group who plays fighting game, I'd recommend the PS3 version over this. It's cheap, offers a lot more, and if you install it's not too bad on the load time.

. 2. Soul Calibur: Broken Destiny

Similar to Tekken, I've played a lot of SC games, starting with Soul Edge. My favorite was SCII. SC is also a series of 3d games, but with a more fantasy element. Instead of different fighting styles, characters have different weapons which gives each character a unique style. 


***The Good Things***

1. Easy to get into. Similar to Tekken, SC relies on 4 buttons(vertical slash, horizontal slash, kick, and block). Whether you're a button masher or a pro, you can enjoy SC. 

2. Lots of customization from the get go. In SC you can make your own character, give them an in-game characters fighting style, and customize their looks. Unliked Tekken, you can choose from a multitude of options right from the start

3. Full fledged tutorial teaching you how to play. Everything from the most basic to advanced techniques can be learned by playing the games gauntlet challenge mode. 


***The Not as Good Things***
1. No online. Ug. 

2. Fewer characters than console games. 

3. Custom characters kind of ugly. 

**Verdict**
If you are new to the SC series you should definitely pick it up to see if you like the fighting style, but if you don't have friends with the game you will probably find yourself unmotivated to play after messing up the computer regularly. 

. 3. BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend

I. Love. BlazBlue. I played the first game SO MUCH. I played a lot of guilty gear and was so excited when BB came out, and actually grew to like BB more. But personal feelings aside, how is it as a game? BB is a 2d command input/combo game, but very different from SF/KoF and other 2d fighters. BB uses A,B,C and D, to attack, and each character has special ""drive techniques"" that make them very unique. It you have played Gulty Gear, you will find some characters to be similar to characters of that franchise. 

***The Good Things***

1. Character selection. BB: CSE features all of the characters from the first game(calamity trigger) and all of the DLC characters you had to buy for the PS3 version of CS, and then some new characters as well. 

2. Variety. Every character is different. Each characters drive and special moves are different, and finding a character that fits your play style is very satisfying. 

3. Game play modes. Arcade mode, story mode, and an extra challenging no continue mode are available. 

4. Online play! Excellent net code makes for great online matches.

5. Amazing music

***The Not as Good Things***

1. Character customization. You can do palette swaps, but that's it. 

2. Steep learning curve on some characters. Having a general knowledge of fighting game types will help you, but even then some of the characters are pretty difficult to learn to play well. 

3. Controls(only for a few characters) The game was designed for the arcade, so some characters are kind of hard to use on an controller(namely my main man Tager and Carl)

**Verdict**

BB is in my opinion the strongest fighting game offered so far. It's fun, challenging, and fully featured, and the only game to have online play. If you don't like a humorous story and anime style graphics you might not like it. 

Well that's all! I hope that this wasn't a huge waste of your time. Let me know what you think, if you think my opinions are all dumb, or anything else!"	t5_2u8bb	True
