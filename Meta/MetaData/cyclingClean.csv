-Minneapolis blog encourages people to attack cyclists with hot sauce and water as a chemical irritant.  Recently, one man was found after being attacked from a car with an unknown irritant:

""Patiently scout your surroundings, be sure to check for witnesses, and, when the time is right, slide open the door and pull up along side your prey.  Yell something like, “HEY SWEET TITS” or “YOU’RE NOT LANCE!” to get his attention.

When he looks over, blast him in the face from two or three barrels filled with the potion then race off before he has the chance to flush his eyes and get a glimpse of your plates.  Serves him right!""

""My wife was biking south on Minnehaha today (Saturday, July 6) around 4:15 p.m. when she encountered a bicyclist crawling on the boulevard and saying he was blind and needed water. 

My wife stopped to assist the man, as did some nearby residents, and she gathered that somebody had thrown some liquid at the man, presumably from a passing vehicle -- though the vehicle part is merely an assumption on my part."""	t5_2qhyi	True

I'm tired, exhausted, destroyed, and amazed...  I can't believe how long 100 miles is!  

Anyways, I just wanted to share my accomplishment and encourage anyone out there who is considering it to get on it and find a century ride.  There's no feeling in the world like being on this side of that ride!

Basically, I'm about 5'8, and about 240lbs, and not wearing it well. After a lot of thinking and some objective thinking, I realized I need to do something about this. I've started with the common sense stuff - ""Get yo' salad, no dessert"" as Kanye once said - but although the food stuff is going well, I need to team it with exercise. That's where the question comes in. 

I used to ride when I was younger (And a tiny bit slimmer) and I used to get shouted at by strangers about how my bike is about to collapse. I know some of it was piss-taking since my butt can't actually swallow a bike seat (...where would it go?) but I'm still nervous if I'm actually too fat to ride a bike. 

Is there a weight limit or anything? Any insight would be awesome.

I was honked at twice (once each way) on my ride today. I work third shift. The area closest to my work has very bike-unfriendly roads with little to no shoulder and the rednecks who drive through there are unused to seeing a cyclist in that part of town. I try my best to give them as wide a berth as possible. I give hand signals and have proper back and front lights for riding after dark. I feel bad that I got honked at even though I wasn't doing anything illegal or incorrect on the road. There is not an alternate route, and I have no car, no money for a car, no public transportation is available and I *need* my job. Also, the benefits of the physical activity are amazing. I feel better than I have in years. How can I get involved locally to make my municipal government aware that there is a huge problem getting around parts of my area without a car? 	t5_2qhyi	True

My goal was sub 39 minutes. The course was gradually uphill on the way out with a challenging 300 meter long 10% hill at the turn around.

I started down the start ramp, went over the first bump in the road and realized I had not tightened my saddle enough and my saddle angled down, causing me to slide for the entire race and putting way too much pressure on my shoulders. I was basically uncomfortable for the whole race.

The first half is more challenging and I did the first 13k in just over 18 minutes, well on pace to beat my goal. On a flat section of the course with about 10k to go, I had a bee fly into my mouth and sting the roof of my mouth extremely close to my throat. I managed to spit the bee out after getting stung but the stinger stayed in my mouth. Thankfully I am not allergic to bees, however I still was freaking out. I sat out of aero and tried to scratch out the stinger but every time I tried it kept getting lodged deeper into my mouth. I decided to just keep riding and the faster I got back, the faster I could go to the medic at the finish line. managed to finish the race is 40:25 and all things considered I was very happy with the time as it was a PB."	t5_2qhyi	True

I was in an accident not long ago, where a car came in front of me and blocked me. At the moment I am discussion regarding the value of my bicycle, which is a 06 Trek Madone 5.2 Carbon in good condition(at least it used to be). They have agreed to pay for the loss, below is the estimate and how they calculated it. I feel the bicycle is worth more considering its condition prior to the accident. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has any advice for me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

&gt; I considered depreciation of 20% per year for a bicycle which is based off the average life of 5 years.
I took a depreciation of 80% which leaves an ACV of 20% of the current replacement cost since the bicycle is over 5 years old.
20% of ACV of $3,589 = $717.80

Depreciation rate seems high, the bicycle was well maintained.

I'm on my way home from work, around 7pm, it's dark, scraped snow on the roads, but nothing unusual. I don't have lights on my bike because every time I buy the cheap ones they fall apart. Shitty excuse.
Riding down a quiet back street, see a car coming from my left that has a stop sign.... by the time I realize he's not stopping I'm already too far into the intersection. I lock up front and rear, but it doesn't help.

The front of the car hit my left leg, and I guess I went up into the air and somehow landed back on my left side - hip and elbow. I know I'm OK at this point, but he has not even hit the brakes, so I think he's going to run me right over. Holy shit I've never been more scared in my life. I screamed to stop so loud my throat still hurts now. Of everything I've ever done in my life, the fear of going under the wheels of a car was suddenly very real.

I spring up, out of the way. He does stop. Old guy from out of town, had no chance to see me even in daylight I think. I'm freaking out cos I seriously thought he was going right over the top of me, so I immediately call 911 and the cops show up ~2 mins later.

They ask some questions for 5, then leave. Nothing happened. I walked home.

I'm fine, lost a good amount of skin in a few places and leg hurts but nothing serious. I think the bike frame is bent, hard to tell in the dark. It's a shit cheap bike, so I don't care too much about that. There are holes in my good winter jacket, which sucks.

As of late, the idea of cycling has slowly crept in to my mind. With my school being 7 miles away and my job being 6, I thought that with a bike, I can save on gas, car maintenance and invest in my health as well/. The more I looked in to cycling though, I saw all the cool things you can do to bikes, such as adding panniers and lights, and gps and computers and other cool things. hell, I even saw cool spinning light attachments for the rims, which would help make me visible at night, considering that I work late and usually end up getting out around 11 or 12.

Only problem though is, I dont have a bike just yet. I literally have no money to spend on a bike right now, but while searching, I saw this [Huffy Savannah Bike at Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/700c-M-Savannah-road-bike-model-56760-black/12517029) which appears to have really good reviews from people. I really dont know what 700c tires are, or whether this bike is right for me since every person I talk to keeps telling me ""GET YOURSELF MEASURED!!!!!"" But I dont have the money to get measured. I saw somewhere that was charging like 125 to measure me. I was like ""that is more than the bike I want!!""

Doesnt help that my dad has a Trek 52001 120 Carbon series, which he told me costed him around 2500 bucks. I laughed at him when he suggested me a trek bike. I dont have anwhere near the type of scratch needed for a Trek bike. But let me ask you, this is my first real bike that I would be getting for commuting and shopping, I've had other bikes when I was younger, but that was only to riding to my buddy's house down the block. So I dont know, is that bike good at all? I have seen some youtube videos on it, as well as other sites that give it good reviews. is a cheapy bike good to start off with or should I invest more money? Will I be able to upgrade pieces as I go? Sorry, I didnt see anything on the sidebar to help out the new people.

What should I be looking for in a bike? Are there any particular companies that I should be looking at.

Also, what kind of price range should I be expecting for a nice ride? Is $300 - $400 realistic?

I hope this isn't the incorrect subreddit for this question. 


When I bought my bicycle, I bought it as someone who really had no idea what he was doing. I bought a Marin Kentfield. It's a hybrid bike and it was in my pricerange. I thought it offered versatility, but I really find that it just disappoints, because I only ever ride on the road. 

I am considering commuting by bike to campus instead of getting parking passes ($360/year). It's not too far of a commute, but there are some pretty big hills.

I was wondering if you guys think it would be worth the investment to get a road bike (probably in the ~$700-750 range). Do you think this is a good idea? Will I notice a big difference over my current bike? Is a road bike my best option, or is there something that I am as of yet unaware of?


Thanks so much! 


(Here's a model, maybe not the same year, of my current bike: http://products.howstuffworks.com/marin-kentfield-bicycle-review.htm)

Also, I'm not sure how relevant this is, but I'm a big guy (230), and about 6 feet tall.


EDIT: I don't know if anyone'll see this, because this is kind of old, but I'll try. 

The reasons I don't like the Kentfield are these: I don't really like the geometry. I feel like I can't be fast or efficient on it. Also, it has suspension, but I never, ever use it. So I feel like it is a waste. Also, I have had problems with it before, and when I take it to the bike shop, my options are limited due to its design with fairly cheap parts. (I couldn't put a better wheel on the back).

What I would like is something without suspension, that would also be a bit lighter. I would like to be able to put a rack and paniers on it, almost certainly. I like having those a lot.

However, I also like to ride for fun. So while this would be a commuter bike, I also intend to ride around with my friends on the weekends. Lately I haven't been able to keep up!

I grew up biking. My first bike was at age 4. My first job was at age 13 in a bike shop. I loved biking. every check I got went right back to the store for more parts as I built my own bmx from the mongoose frame, I found in a trash bin, up.

When I was about 15 i quit biking to start skateboarding. 
between age 15 and 30 I only had one bike, a Dyno cruiser, which I hardly ever rode. 

When I was 30 I got a job that I felt I could commute via bike to. My friend suggested a single speed bike since they are light weight, simple, and my commute was more or less flat. I got a Felt single speed bike and immediately was considered a fixie hipster. Explain as I may that it is a single speed with a freewheel and brakes, I was still a fixie hipster. I only used the bike for small errands, short distances, I ended up not using it for commuting at all because it turned out the road was too dangerous (motorist dangers, no bike lane).

I'm 32 now. I started a new job with HP a few months ago and was notified about a fund raiser, a century ride fund raiser. I'm all about helping and volunteering, so I signed up. I've never done anything like this before, but I figured I'll give it a shot. I didn't have a geared road bike, but I figured I can just train on my single speed until I have enough money for a real road bike. GOOD LORD they are expensive! I spent a month checking craigslist every day for something my size, not aluminum (need comfort for 100mi ride), and within budget. Finally I found a deal! I bought a Specialized Allez Triple for $600! It is a little old, but for a first bike I think I did pretty good. This was last Friday. The next day I did a ride with some of the HP team, a cycling team called the vanderkittens, and some of the organizers of the Canary Foundation fund raiser. We rode through the hills of Palo Alto on a popular route simply known as ""the loop"". It was about a 20 mile ride. Quickly I realized there was no way possible I would have been able to do this on a single speed. It was my first ride, it was challenging, and rewarding, and I really enjoyed it!

The century ride is on September 28th so this only gives me about 7 weeks (?) to train. With that in mind I decided I will commute on bike to work everyday. It is a 13.5 mile commute each way along a designated, paved, bike path along a creek. The commute is really nice. it takes less than an hour, it is scenic, it isn't all that challenging, and I get to practice for the century.

What I've noticed - There is a different kind of comradery amongst cyclists than say, fixie riders. I rode that single speed for a while and never got a nod, a ""good morning"", a wave, a smile... On my road bike it is a completely different story. Everyone is super nice! Also, everyone is very careful about following the rules of the road and etiquette - not something I would associate with the fixie riders (i've seen enough sidewalk riding, crosswalk riding, wrong side of the road, running lights, etc...). Maybe it is a respect thing? I don't know, but I like it.

Anyways, it has been less than a week with my new bike and I'm loving it. Maybe I always loved it, but just never had the right bike. Wish me luck on my century ride, I'm going to need it! If anyone wants to make a donation here is the link - http://canary.convio.net/goto/ryanhatescancer

I trying to freight my bike from Haugesund to Helsinki as I fly out of Helsinki back to Australia at the end of the month to avoid carrying it with me on all the flights and train journeys needed. Unfortunately none of the freight companies I have contacted are willing for me to leave my bike in storage for 3 weeks until I can collect. I am hoping that someone may be able to allow me to have the bike sent to them and left at their place until I can collect it on the 28th of July... Beers and dinner given in gratitude plus a financial reward if so desired!

Please let me know if there is anyone who can help.

1369052140.0	1eotxf	A question about speed and one about heart rate	siovene	15	0	28	"Hi,
I've been commuting to work for a while with a hybrid bike, and just got a Trek Madone 3.5 (2012) to get more serious with road cycling.

I'm a bit of a data freak, so I like to analyze my rides and track my progress. But since I try to go on different routes as much as possible, because obviously variety is nice, I can't really graph my average speeds, because they depend on the elevation gain on each route.

Is there a software of a website that will either normalize my average speed by ascent/descent grade, and/or graph average speeds independently for each grade?

This way, I would know whether my average speed on the flat is increasing, and if I'm getting better on climbs.

Another question I have is about heart rate. I just went for a 2 hour ride (54 km, or 33.5 miles), with an elevation gain of 462 meters (1515 feet). My average heart rate was 172 bpm (I'm a 32 year old male, with resting heart rate of 55 bpm. I'm about 4 kg, or 8 lbs fatter than my supposed ideal weight).

Isn't that too much? Is it going to just get lower and lower as I train? At that heart rate, I'm almost constantly in my Zone 5, well away from the fat burning zone. I've tried going on slow rides to keep in the fat burning zone, but I literally felt nothing, and didn't even break a sweat.

I am im pretty decent shape from a lot of other exercise, like running, weight lifting and swimming, but I want to do a triathlon so I needed to start cycling as well. (I don´t have a bike yet). Here´s the thing: the first time I went exercising I had an ""incident"". I think I leaned forward to grip the handles farther away from my body, and I just kinda started to leak a little bit. Safe to say, I panicked and ran outta there. I wasn´t wearing any underwear underneath my cycling shorts so there was a pretty visible stain on my shorts that would be hard to explain. But it is not like I had a proper piss. I have gone for a few more turns on the spinning cycle after that without incident, but I have also refrained from leaning forward.

1367058170.0	1d7ko1	New to group rides - some questions about riding with a pack	Fujiwara_tofu	17	4	14	"I've recently started doing weekly group rides with a casual group of about 12 people. However, the group isn't very organised on the road - e.g. nobody ever rolls off the front so the only way to move up in the group is to sprint past other riders. There are usually big gaps as well. Being a weak rider, I tend to sit on the back of the group, trying to catch whatever draft I can and hoping not to get dropped. 

So my questions are:

1) Am I right to think this group could do things better?

2) Is there a disadvantage in sitting at the back of the pack? (Sure feels like it, but I can't put my finger on why.)

2) What's the classy way to ride in situations like this?

The other day at the park I did this with a stranger for about 30km (18.5 miles). About halfway through when we were closer we exchanged short greetings. Later, having noticed that I was a newbie, he gave me tips about proper technique, but that was the extent of our verbal interactions.

I'll start off by saying that I haven't really ridden any bikes as an adult. I, of course, had a number of bikes growing up. Mostly BMX and mountain bike styles. Nothing ever too fancy. Wal-Mart brands and the like. I moved to Chicago six months ago and have been wanting to get into cycling. I mostly run for exercise and use the CTA for transportation right now. My girlfriend's mother's boyfriend (I know) had this bike in storage for at least a couple years that he got very cheap but never rides it. He offered it to me when he found out I wanted to start cycling.

I was surprised that he actually had the manual for the bike, and I gave that a read-through. I was surprised how conversationally it was written and the amount of good info I was able to glean from it. 

My quick research suggests that this bike was at least $1000-$1500 brand new and still worth quite a lot. The copyright in the manual was from 1996, so I assume that the bike was manufactured around the same year.

So, does anyone have any suggestions how I should get this bike into shape and start riding it? I think I'll probably have to get different pedals, as the ones that are on there require special shoes (I think). Also, the grip tape is all deteriorated, so I'm sure I can replace that. Also also, the valve on the intertube is really small. I think the manual called it a presta valve. Any tips on pumps? Any thing else on the bike that you guys can point out would be great. I know very little about bikes and how they work. I'm not even entirely sure I know how the gear shift works on this thing!

Thanks.

Need Advice for When to Lift what in Conjunction with Cycling

I am pretty sure I need to change the order of my workout days. The problem - my Lower back especially but also glutes and hams are too sore.

I am using road biking for my fat burning/cardio 2x a week, but that is aligning with my lifting to make a 4 day block of aggressively tickling my hinder (which I am not necessarily ""into"").


**Here is my current workout schedule:**

M - Chest/Bis (Bench Press)

T - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

W - Back/Tris (Deadlifts)

Th - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

F - Legs/Shoulders (Squats)

  
  

**Here is the problem**

T - Cycling causes lower back strain due to bent over position as well fatigue on glutes and hams.

W - Deadlifts hit the posterior chain and fatigue the lower back, glutes and hams. Bent over row relies on the lower back to stabilize.

Th - Cycling (as above)

F - Squats clearly hit the glutes and hams (lower back is fine here) and then lunges clear up the rest of my ability to function.


**The result -**
 I walk like a weirdo way longer than the normal walk like a weirdo for a day after deadlifts that most guys I know deal with.

My goals: Get pain free while getting stronger at deadlifts and squats (neglected them for years) and lose 10 pounds.

I am trying to get things to line up so that I am not doing too much on a given day as I am running at around 2000-2300 calories a day vs 3300 maintenance (I am 6'6"" 250 looking to hit 240 soon). I can handle the deficit mentally, but I don't want to kill myself.

Taking all this into consideration, should I just go ahead and put cycling on the same day as chest/bis in order to move it away from deadlifts? I really want to keep doing squats - buy maybe actually do cycling on M and F and just use the squats as the only leg move for that day?

If you were in my shoes - what would you do?

I have a budget ~200, I'm willing to pay for something of quality that will last. Wouldn't really like to go over $200 unless necessary.

Ideally this jacket would have a good amount of pockets, maybe one on the inside for valuable items. Bright. Reflective material. A drawstring hood. Protects neck. Wind-resistant. Keeps heat in (but not baking), and keeps cold out. 

Also I need gloves. I currently use these shitty fingerless knitted gloves. Although very warm for casual use, it's not ideal to lose feeling in my fingers when riding. So I need a fully protective glove that is wind-resistant, super warm, yet slim enough that I won't feel like I'm wearing oven mitts.

Any info you can give would be really appreciated! Also any thoughts on what can actually be a better solution would also be amazing!

What do you guys to with the left over wrapper? is there a problem with littering on your regular biking routes? Is the foil easy to open? Can you do it while riding? Can you empty the whole packet? Is the foil uncomfortable while you are sucking the gel out? 

Again any ideas on this will be really appreciated and VERY helpful!  "	t5_2qhyi	True

1314314437.0	jujiu	First century this Sunday, any advice?	sprouticus	17	4	30	"I know I should eat before I'm hungry, drink before I'm thirsty, and take full advantage of all the rest stops...anything else I should keep in mind?

EDIT: The century went great! I never felt like I was going to bonk, I actually felt really strong for the entire ride. I met a cyclist who rode at my pace at the very start, so we hung together the whole day. We took it pretty easy and came in at 7:45 with a pace just under 13mph. I tried not to attack the climbs, but that didn't last so I just went for it. I'd pass a bunch of folks only to have them pass me right back once we eased back into the flats. We took our time at rest stops, even taking advantage of the chiropractor on hand at mile 75 for some stretching. I could have pushed myself a lot more, but finishing feeling good was more important to me. 

Thanks so much to everyone for their advice! Looking forward to the next one. :)

As I get started here, I'm not quite to vain as to not ask for the advice of such learned cyclists as yourselves; please read on:

IAmA Former Marine getting back in to shape, 25 years old and in generally good health - 6'1, 200 lbs. I am quite lucky to have a bike-friendly community, and an easy 5-6 mile commute to work which is ~75% packed/paved bikepath, and the remainder (beginning and end) paved road. Many of my coworkers and customers (I'm a bartender) are avid cyclists, several of whom ride on sponsored teams in the area and many who make ridiculous money delivering sandwiches on their bikes to the downtown area where we work. For that reason, I'm attempting to not only use the bike for commuting, but also for riding with friends on some longer and more road-based treks (Obviously harboring no notions that a beginner will be able to ride at their level with any sort of speed).

After consulting with many of them, I've settled on a Cyclocross bike, which should get in this week/weekend (Specifically, a Marin Toscana: http://www.marinbikes.com/2011/bike_specs.php?serialnum=1175 ). It seems like the best fit for my needs at the moment.

Anyone have advice on additional ear I still need to purchase? I've got the obvious (Helmet/lock/light) but I'm wondering what you would suggest I purchase as well? I'm already looking into a pair of cycling shorts for longer rides. Also, I'll be riding a lot at night (Again, bartender commuting) and wondering if TWO sets of lights would give me any advantage? Or is that just unnecessary overkill?

Any additional advice you feel a beginning rider/commuter needs to know?

Thanks in advance and apologies for asking what are most likely novice and annoying questions.

EDIT: Midwestern state here, so pretty temperate climate. As far as the rain goes, I don't mind so much. I can change at work and plan on keeping a few extra sets of clothes there anyhow. No, not spamming for Marin, just happens to be what my friends all recommended :D"	t5_2qhyi	True

I’ll be the first one to admit that I didn’t take such good care of it and long history short it broke down yesterday and it’s going to cost me around half the initial cost to repair it. Instead of that I was thinking about selling it (I know I’m not getting much) and buying a better and more suitable one, so I would really appreciate some suggestions on brands and models (My budged is around  1, 000 dollars give or take a couple hundred) and especially some tips for taking better care of the said new bike.


Some extra info, I’ll be using the bike to commute around 75 - 80 miles a week, some trail riding once or twice a month and the exceptional 100 – 110 miles long trip on long weekends or vacations, all this with around 25 – 30 pounds of baggage (and I’m around 200 pounds), by the way I’m currently residing in Chile if it’s relevant.

I just moved to Bloomington Illinois, a city with a great cycling community. I used to be a distance runner, but due to bad knees, I've decided to switch to cycling.

At the local shop I got a really great deal on an old Schwinn Le Tour ($200, well maintained, rides like a dream), and I picked up a phone mount so I can use my mobile as a computer to track time, distance, and get me home if I'm lost.

So, I have two questions. I want to get in really good cardio shape - I've been aiming for around 1 hour in the saddle every day, and I might look into HIIT if that doesn't get me in the shape I'd like. An tips or ideas for biking for cardio? Not a lot of hills (read:none) near me, so it's mostly just flat, long, rides.

Second, what should I look our for next? I'm using old running shorts, t shirts, and running shoes now. I have a helmet, and a great pair of sunglasses. I don't make very much money, so part of me wants to save up so I can spend on winter gear and ride year round. What kind of items are essentials? Once I'm totally moved in I want to get a saddle bag, tube, and portable pump so I can do some real long weekend rides and not worry too much about breakdowns. What else should I look out for?

Thanks guys"	t5_2qhyi	True

I bought it new, and the thing is slowly turning into a rusted piece of crap, but I guess I should have expected that from a $120 bike. 

I ride my bike literally every day, several times a day. I use it to get to work, to get to class, to get to my fishing spot, errands, fun, and to burn fat. I feel like if I use a bike as often as I do, I should treat myself to a good one. Some time down the road, maybe next summer, I would like to train and participate in RAGBRAI. 

Searching through the RAGBRAI forums, people say a road-bike is the best way to go. I have never been on a road bike in my life, and I honestly feel like I am too heavy for one (and they look terribly uncomfortable compared to my cruiser)  Riding my cruiser has helped me lose 55lbs (and still losing!) , but as a 5'8"" female, I am still 50lbs over weight.

I've had it a while, but.. well, I'm one of those people who has a gym membership and never uses it. I'm sick of being out of shape, but thanks to 10 years of smoking, don't have the lung capacity to run. I've been cigarette free for 3 months now, and I'd love to get on the bike for at least 30-60 min a couple times a week. A couple things I'm worried about, though. 

* I don't really understand ""correct pedalling"". I usually throw it into 8 and just push hard. 
* The area near me is mostly flat, but I'd like to go on some longer rides that involve hills. How should gear shifting work? Higher gears on downhill, right?
* Attire - I should be alright wearing gym shorts and a tshirt, right? 
* Belongings - I really don't want to leave my phone, wallet, bike tool and a knife at home. Any tips on storing these? There was a ""commuter"" option for these bikes from Performance, that included a back rack. 
* Bringing my bike to work - A car rack, duh! Any tips on locking it to the rack to keep it safe?

* **Update**: Something I remembered when riding yesterday: The bike is only an 8 speed. I feel like that might be a performance/exercise hinderence. Even just riding down the flat street, I feel like I'm spinning my pedals at 1000000 rpm unless I'm in 7 or 8.

1369252446.0	1euskb	Looking for the perfect cycling backpack...	warrenlain	11	0	24	"About me:

I commute around 50 miles each week with my laptop and mini u-luck, plus some random things like a fresh t-shirt, kindle, power supply, bike tools. Occasionally I pick up a few grocery items on the way home. I also take weekend trips.

As for my current setup, I own a messenger-style Timbuk2 laptop bag ([the Command](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/command-laptop-tsa-friendly-messenger-bag/2114704)), but it hasn't been doing the job for me. The bag shifts to my side when I ride unless I cinch it so tight it makes me uncomfortable around my collarbone/neck/shoulder. Capacity and organization-wise, it's great, but I am thinking of selling it because I enjoy cycling more when I use my much smaller but not so tough [MONO Expander Pack](http://www.monocase.com/store/pc/Civilian-Expander-Pack-p2962.htm). The capacity and organization on this backpack is not bad, the laptop protection is great, the design is beautiful, but the toughness is nowhere near a true cycling bag.

I'm looking for the perfect cycling backpack that will be:

1. tough,
1. won't shift around while riding,
1. will protect my laptop with adequate padding and is weatherproof
1. has at least 20L capacity (so it can handle what I'd pack for weekend trips) but isn't so huge it would feel bulky around town
1. aesthetically pleasing?

I'm hoping you guys know of a bag that I don't, because I've already done quite a bit of research. I've looked at and almost purchased:

1. [Chrome Soyuz](http://www.chromeindustries.com/bags/laptop-bags/soyuz#readmore)
1. [Chrome Bravo](http://www.chromeindustries.com/bravo)
1. [Chrome Welded Rucksack](http://www.chromeindustries.com/welded-rucksack) (new for Chrome's Spring line)
1. [Timbuk2 Swig](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/swig-laptop-backpack)
1. [Timbuk2 Q](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/q-backpack)
1. [Mission Workshop Rambler](http://missionworkshop.com/products/bags/backpacks/roll_top/medium_rambler.php)
1. [Mission Workshop Fitzroy](http://missionworkshop.com/products/bags/backpacks/rucksack/fitzroy.php)/[Fitzroy VX](http://missionworkshop.com/products/advanced_projects/vx-large-rucksack.php)
1. [Mission Workshop R2 or R6 + Arkiv Laptop Case](http://missionworkshop.com/products/arkiv-system-bags/)

PROS and CONS of each:

**Chrome Soyuz**: PROS - laptop pocket with side-access, organizational pockets, u-lock pocket, waterproof main compartment, chest strap, accessory loops on straps, super tough material. CONS - main compartment is too deep and rolltop opening is too narrow, can't easily find things. Built in China.

**Chrome Bravo**: PROS - expandable upwards, laptop pocket, organizational pocket, waterproof main compartment, external compression straps, chest strap, accessory loops on straps, super tough material. CONS - main compartment is expandable, but potentially awkward for cycling when looking behind for cars. Made in China.

**Chrome Welded Rucksack**: PROS - all of the above for Chrome. Laptop functions as a separate case with organizational loops. CONS - not expandable, a bit small.

**Timbuk2 Swig**: PROS - laptop pocket with side access and drop protection, lots of organizational potential, chest strap, cheap. CONS - the style is ""hip,"" not really my thing. I am more into the muted, minimal look.

**Timbuk2 Q**: PROS - same as above. CONS - same as above, plus it doesn't seem as tough as Chrome or Mission Workshop.

**Mission Workshop Rambler**: PROS - doubles in size and compresses down very nicely, great fit, chest strap, laptop compartment, very high quality stitching, urethane-coated zippers, super tough material, beautiful bag, lifetime warranty... and made in the USA. CONS - no organizational pockets, everything goes straight to the bottom of the abyss of the bag, including the laptop compartment which means no drop protection. Expensive as hell.

**Mission Workshop Fitzroy/Fitzroy VX**: PROS - all of the Rambler qualities except doubling in size. CONS - same, laptop compartment seems like an afterthought. Expensive as hell!

**Mission Workshop R2 or R6 + Arkiv Laptop Case**: PROS - all of the Rambler qualities except doubling in size. The most aesthetically pleasing of all the bags. Laptop sleeve also functions as a separate case, which is nice but not necessary. CONS - even more expensive!!!!! Have to sell a kidney for this one especially if I want the other accessory pockets...

I know this may seem like overkill but I figure if there is anyone who understands, it is the cycling community...

I picked up an old Raleigh from the habitat for humanity store today and I'd like to restore it to rideable condition. The bike is in really remarkable condition given its age (~40 years); looking at the pads and normal areas of wear I'd even go so far as to say its never been ridden. 

That said there is some serious grime build up and the cables are pretty slack. My plan is to give it a proper strip down and cleaning, lube &amp; grease (if needed), and straightening out some bent parts. The original dunlops look nice but are extremely cracked, and the pads are dried out. 

The tricky part for me us that it has a sturmey archer internal 3 speed hub which I know nothing about maintenance for. It will go through the gears but takes way too much force to be healthy.

I am moving to Salt Lake City in January from albuquerque NM , where you can ride (snow-free) basically year round. I am typically a fixed rider but as my rides get longer and longer I am considering the jump to a geared bike. I would like to only get one bike, a road bike, but am worried that if I do, I will not be able to ride at all in SLC until April.

1320259374.0	lxz2d	Noob question.... Bikes for the whole family...	Terra99	13	1	30	"I'm planning on buying some bikes for my kids, myself and my wife. I've done a bit of googling and have a few answers, but I was hoping to get some insight from a bike enthusiast. In responses, please provide a highly budget concious response. I can (and probably will) buy new bikes on credit, but I want to minimize this as much as possible. If I can get a perfectly fine bike at wal-mart for half the price of the uber high quality bike at a bike shop, then I want the wal-mart answer. I'm also mechanically inclined and good at following instructions so if the cheaper route involves labor of me putting it together, I'm all ears.

First, the kids:
The kids are 5 and 9. Neither one of them are good bike riders yet and this is due mostly to the fact I haven't taken them out on their bikes as often as they like. I have a strong feeling the bikes they currently have are too small for them. According to this chart: http://bicycling.about.com/od/howtoride/a/bike_sizes.htm

Based on height instead of age, my son should have an 18 inch bike and my daughter should have a 24 inch bike. In measuring the bikes the kids currently have, is this measuring the inner rim on the bike or the outside of the tire to the outside of the tire? It's possible I could spray paint my daughters bike (it's pink) to a color my son would like and let him use it, but I've also heard there's a structural difference in boy vs. girls bikes... something I'm not sure I understand or if it's really worth caring about since he'll outgrow it in a couple of years anyways. Feedback?

As I mentioned above, neither of them are strong riders so I want something that will be easy for them to control probably at slower speeds. If they get good, then maybe a faster bike down the line. I expect them to be mostly biking on sidewalks and other flat surfaces for a while. What should I look for and where should I go to get their bikes?

Now for me:
I'm trying to lose weight. I've been doing good at staying on a healthy diet and getting a modest amount of exercise on a daily basis which I have been slowly ramping up. Biking was on my to do list from day 1 and I'm about ready to bring it in. I have bad knees and my ankles don't support me doing running and walking for more than 2 miles. Biking is perfectly fit for me because it doesn't put more stress than my knees and ankles can handle and allows me to get out of the house. I'm at about 290 lbs and would be using the bike mostly for exercise purposes, but I might look for an occasional bike-a-thon/fun race here and there. I'm not caring about speed as much as I am about durability and just getting to the finish line. I expect to be sticking mostly to roads and sidewalks. I'm willing to pay a little bit more for a bike for myself since I expect it would be the right size for much longer than one for my kids. What should I look for in a bike and where should I go to get it for maximum bang for my buck.

And for my wife:
She is more overweight than I am, but I don't know her exact weight and I don't feel like sleeping on the couch in order to find out. If I had to guess I'd say 320ish. When I've touched on the topic of getting bikes she has shown interest in doing the same thing. I think if she gets into it, she'll be in the same type of needs as me, but I am skeptical that she'd ever join a bike-a-thon (but then she might suprise me). As with myself, I'm willing to invest a little bit more in a bike for her with long term expectations and all so I pose the same questions with her in mind....


**UPDATE:** So it turns out my in-laws have a pair of bikes they don't use. They were offered to us so I took them to the bike shop and the verdict is they are in pretty good shape. They need minor work that I can do myself and new tires so I'm ending up with a pair of road bikes for myself and my wife for less than $75 in parts."	t5_2qhyi	True

A bit of backstory - feel free to skip.  I haven't been in the saddle in a long time, due to just being busy and a million other reasons.  I have a road bike that is in decently working condition, a project bike, and a mountain bike that needs front brakes.  I lost 50 pounds in 12 weeks cycling like crazy 9 years ago, and I am thinking about taking advantage of some of the areas around Waco that seem decent for cycling.  

I'm going to reel off a shitload of questions.  Answer any or all if you feel like it.

1)  I need a helmet.  What should I be getting?  I am a cheapskate (mainly because I'm broke).  I used to just go with one of those stupid hats with the flipped up bill, you remember those?

2)  I have a broken brake set on the front of my Trek mountain bike, and I don't know what to get.  Are those fairly standard?  They just screw in to the assembly or something?

3)  I'm getting older, so I'm a little worried about protecting my prostate.  Is there anything I can do?  (I saw a prostate-protecting seat, and it looked like plastic-coated fail.)

4)  I used to like to listen to music while I rode.  This is a bad idea, right?  

5)  On my road bike, the shifters are down on the frame, and I'd like to move them up to the bars/brakes.  Is this going to be pretty hard?  I'm kind of handy, but I've never worked on bikes before.

I'll bug y'all later about my project bike - it's an old school Cannondale, gonna need some serious work."	t5_2qhyi	True
1315003568.0	k2z15	Highly inconsistent performance - why?	jaasx	12	1	27	"So I bike a fair amount.  I'm not great but in relatively good shape.  I'm by no means a natural athlete and don't expect to win any races or anything.  I bike with some other guys and one thing I notice is how much I vary in performance day-to-day while everyone else seems far more consistent.  Maybe 10% of the time I can hang with them and pound up the hills ready for more.  40% of the time I'm having my 'normal' days - struggling along on the back end. 50% of the time I'm just way down and am embarrassed to be riding.  For the life of me I can't figure out what's wrong.  I've monitored sleep, food, activity levels, hydration and there doesn't seem to be any  correlation.  
  

My bad days are just this dreadful feeling of fatigue once I start riding.  Up until I start riding I have no idea if it will be a good or bad day.  I'm not particularly panting but my power is down for a given heart rate.  My legs usually feel fine, there's just no energy no matter how hard I want it.  Other notables: 

* Age = 39
* Weight = 150
* Very regular headaches  (tension/tmj)
* Relatively poor lung capacity - probably due to pneumonia when I was young.  
* After a hard ride I can have phlegm in my throat that causes me to cough and hack for a few hours.  But during my ride I don't feel like I'm wheezing or short of breath.  I got an asthma inhaler but it made no difference.
* Testosterone level tested as normal
* Food allergy test didn't turn up anything.
* It's not lack of calories, carbs, etc.  

I know you aren't doctors, but any ideas?  

UPDATE - I'm NOT looking for training ideas for getting in shape, but physical reasons as to why I am so variable.  I know we all have good days and bad days - but I know no one who is half as variable as me.

Today I was riding with my cycling partner and we ran into some highwaymen. We were riding close together maybe, 2 to 3 feet apart and one of the guys decided to jump in front of me although stopping for my friend, and he clearly saw us both. Anyways, I was able to disengage a little bit, so the damage to the bike wasn't extremely severe. However, the guy who jumped in front of me went on to pretend that he was unconscious, making retarded sputtering sounds. Another cyclist stopped by to make sure everything was ok, helped the actor to the grass with the actor's friend, all the while I fixed my rim so I could ride home. As soon as the other cyclist leaves, the guy who hit me jumps right up like nothing happens and starts demanding my info. I continue to refuse and straighten my rim until ridable. My partner, is also defending me and I am pretty sure the only reason I wasn't mugged and left for someone to find me is because my friend is 6' 2"" and ripped. I believe I was the target because I am a tiny guy. Anyhow, I had fixed my bike well enough to the point to ride and high tailed it out of there when there was a hint of violence in their voices.

Both of the guys making the scene and demanding my information were obvious drug addicts.

Anyways, just thought I would share my story and maybe help other cyclists in the future.

My friend recently gave me a free Ross road bike from the 80's which has standard flat pedals and no toe clips whatsoever. If I upgrade to clipless pedals, my concern is being stranded in the cleats. I read online that it's basically impossible to walk any distance wearing road bike cleats. I bring my road bike with me on business trips and sometimes ride 10 to 20 miles from the hotel in rural areas. I normally have absolutely NO ONE to call to pick me up if the bike breaks down in the middle of no-where and I have to walk a long distance, and taxi cabs aren't always available. My AAA membership is no help either, as they only help motorized vehicles. Bringing regular shoes in a back-pack all the time seems like a huge inconvenience; I absolutely HATE wearing a back-pack and bring my tools with me in a small carry-on bag. I can fix a flat tire, but probably not other problems which may leave me stranded somewhere!

About me: 21 year old male, looking for a road bike to ride often as a hobby and possibly look to take up cycling as a sport later on.  

Price Range: Anywhere up to and around the $2,000 area.  

In particular I've been looking at:



**Cannondale CAAD10 5 105 2013** ($1,749 AU, on sale for another 4 days)  



**Specialized Allez Comp Mid-Compact 2013** ($1,399 AU on sale)

**Cannondale Supersix 5 105 2013** ($2,159 AU, on sale for another 4 days)



The question I'm obviously wondering is if it is worth the upgrade to the carbon frame of the Supersix for that little extra over the CAAD10. I'm also interested to hear thoughts about the Specialized Allez as well. 

Any help would be much appreciated, can't wait to start riding.

What kind of clipless do you use, why?

Can I interchange one set of pedals for both my mtb bike and road bike? Or would that not be advisable?

1368548708.0	1ebllm	New to cycling: looking for a decent hybrid	yayfroyo	14	2	13	"Hi all, 


I am completely new to cycling so apologies if I sound clueless. I am currently on the look-out for a bike that will get me to/from work (3 miles each way ~ a few hills but mostly flat) and through a 50-mile charity ride. I would love to be able to buy myself a commuter bike and a road bike but I am currently a graduate student. 

I have looked through Craigslist and there appear to be no decent bikes in the 52/53cm range in my area. If they are decent, they are beautiful and really out of my price range.  

After speaking with people at the local bike shop, I came to the conclusion that I was going to buy a hybrid bike this year and then once I get more experience, invest in a proper road bike. 

I have a few options based on bikes available at local shops. The only bike that I have tried (on this list)  is the Fuji Absolute 2.1. 

* '13 Fuji Absolute 2.1 (with discount should be ~ $410)
* '13 Trek Verve 1 (~$470 including taxes)
* '13 Trek 7.1 FX ($500 with taxes)
* '13 Giant Cypress ($370 with discount)

The good thing about the Fuji lies in the fact that the bike shop is super-close to me and the people there were great. (I can't praise them enough about their service.) If anything were to go wrong, it would be fairly easy to get to them. I'm going to test-ride the rest this weekend and then make a decision. 

In the end this bike will probably end up being my commuter bike, but I would like a decent bike to start off on for a few charity rides. I am a 5'7"" female with long arms/legs but that would prefer not to ride a female bike (those paint jobs... really? - most of the female bikes that are actually stocked in stores are too small anyways). 

If you guys have any suggestions as to which of these bikes to avoid or if there is one that really stands out, please let me know. If there are any other bikes within the price range (&lt;$500), I can also be on the look-out for those.

I started riding a road bike a month ago. It all started as a means to loose weight along with my new eating habits. Turns out, I really like cycling and decided to stick with it. 1 month ago today I started on an old 10 speed I got for free and a used mag trainer I bought. I managed to do 15 min on the ""low"" resistance level. Last week the 10 speed started to give out on me so I purchased a new Norco road bike. For the past few days I've started doing a 9.7km route through some hilly areas. I'm ecstatic that I can even ride 10k now(I do have to stop for a break on the big hills), however, I am a little concerned in the fact that I'm not sore after I ride.

About 7 years ago when I was much fitter I use to run, not habitually, and was always very very sore afterwards. It made me feel like I was improving at least. With cycling I only got that after the first week.

(Noob question)"	Antonio_Gargan	12	3	23	"So sorry if this is the most generic question to hit your eyes but I honestly can't understand how my endurance has gone down so far, allow me to elaborate.

So when I was younger (11-12) I used to bike ride with my dad quite a bit. I remember it wasn't that hard for me and I could quite comfortably ride for a couple miles, the longest ride I had done at the time about 7 miles. This was with a cheap bike from Target that was heavy as hell.

Now I am 17 and I need to get in better shape so I want to start bike riding again. My problem, my endurance is garbage. Just today I went on a ride that was a little over a mile (1.1) and when I got off the bike my legs felt like they where light and weird. During the ride I started to get a burning in my legs maybe a third of the way through and my knees started to hurt just a bit after that. I have to constantly stop pedaling to stretch my legs out so the hurt goes away.

The bike I have is a Trek FX 7.3. I am 200lbs (trying to lose weight but I have been stuck at 200 for a few weeks now, the reason I want to start riding again) I am 70 inches tall. I don't know what my cadence is but I wasn't being leasurly about it.

Sorry this is so long and a rather noob question but I just wanted to be detailed about my problem. So any advice on how to build up my endurance and possibly a way to relive the pain I get in my knees when I ride for only a short time.

I've been looking into power meters for some time now. Researching everything I can. In fact my PI is probably a little upset about how much time I spend looking at all of the options out there.

After looking at all 4 types (ibike newton, look keo pedal, srm or quark cranks, power tap hub) I noticed that all give a different reading or interpretation of the cyclists power. ""Duh!"" you might be saying by now. But look at the different types. One is responsive in a forward direction, another responsive in the reverse direction, and two are what you exert or what you put into the bicycle itself.

So which one do you choose? Well, if you have the money, why not all? 

I was thinking about some simple mechanics, power in and power out. Naturally there is a breakdown between the energy put in, transferred, and put back out. Things like mechanical resistance, flex, heat, other sources of friction, tangential forces... all kind of things between your feet and the back wheel that hits the road. Each part having some coefficient of absorption, portions of your effort are never used to move you forward. Minuscule, but additive, I suspect that for each bike there is a maximum transfer efficiency from foot to wheel and that is the best training zone for overall power efficiency. I haven't been able to try any as I'm on a graduate student income. 

It could be as simple using a crank and hub power meter to determine the ratio of power in to power out (≤1). You could potentially use all four types to see how much power is lost at the front of the bike.

So my question is - has anyone actually tried this? I've spent several hours trying different search phrases/key words, but nothing has shown up.

TL:DR? Has anyone used more than one power meter simultaneously in their training? This could be a neat way to follow your training.

This past July 1st, I found a crack at the top of the seat tube of my 2007 Cannondale CAAD9 frame. I took the bike to my local Cannondale dealer to get the problem taken care of under the lifetime warrantee. After having the dealer hold the bike for the entire month, Cannondale claimed that the damage was the result of improperly storing the bike with the seat post out and the post clamp torqued down (which was preposterous) and tried to make me pay them $500 to live up to their warranty. The shop guys were shocked and I told Cannondale to bite me.

I decided to get a new, custom frame because of the great frame builders in Boston and constant fit issues resulting from long legs and a short torso. I went with [Firefly](http://fireflybicycles.com) for a couple of reasons:

* They have a ton of experience building bikes despite being a new company.
* Their bikes look awesome.
* I got to work directly with them when designing the bike.

Jamie, Tyler, and Kevin were great throughout the whole process and even invited me to watch the frame get welded. I couldn't be happier with how working with them went and they built me an amazing bike. It responds exactly the way I want it to but is still incredibly comfortable.

The final kicker is that while my Firefly was being built, I filed a complaint against Cannondale with the MA AG requesting consumer mediation. Once they started getting letters from lawyers, Cannondale changed their tune real quick and sent me a new CAAD9 frame - albeit without bothering to tell me, the consumer advocate, or the shop - which I built up with old parts into my winter/rain bike.

**TL;DR:** Cannondale tried to screw me, sent me a new bike anyways, and I got an awesome new Firefly that I couldn't be happier with. "	t5_2qhyi	True

I've made the trip a few times before, and again, when I hit certain uphills (they're not very steep, quite straight actually, but they tend to  aggregate on me) I tend to really really slow down. I've actually had to take frequent breaks before for about 30 - 40 seconds on the side of the road.

What's your ride like? Is 13K too much, or do I just need to get in the habit? When you hit up hills, do you also stop and take breaks often? Also what's your average speed like? After a while, do you just go on the lowest gear? That's what I do.

Twice in the last two years, I have experienced such dangerous driving by truckers that I emailed their companies. On neither occasion did I get any response.
So what if, every time a trucker does something illegal/reckless which endangers a cyclist, the cyclist emails the company, gives them time to respond, and then when they don't, the unanswered email is forwarded to both the company, and their insurers? Could this possibly affect their premiums? If it was known by trucking companies that this was likely to happen, maybe they'd take complaints more seriously.

Any advice?		10	0	19	"I've been biking all my life but I got really serious about it back in January of this year. 2000 miles later I feel as though I'm ready to tackle my first century. (The longest I've done before this is 80 miles.) I'm 19 years old and a female, if that makes any difference. The ride is an invitational, and I'm going with a group. There will be rest stops every twenty miles or so and sag vehicles driving the route.

Physically, I know I can endure 100 miles. The only thing I'm worried about is the weather. The high is supposed to be around 80, which I can deal with, but any higher and I'm not sure that I'll be performing at my best.

Specifically, I'm looking for advice regarding what to do/eat the days before the ride and your best tips for recovery. I'm guessing riding a century is really not too different from doing an 80, but still. Any advice or words of warning/encouragement are appreciated. I'm pretty excited... I see this as a kind of milestone. =)


ETA: Just got back from the ride! Everything went swimmingly. I stretched at all of the rest stops, and right now my legs don't have that heavy 'after long ride' feeling. The weather was fantastic. The high was 75, and it was sunny. We had a nasty headwind for the first fifty miles (it was around 15-20 mph with gusts), but the worst headwinds make the best tailwinds. Storms started moving in around mile 60, and near the end of the ride we were literally surrounded by fronts, but the worst we got was a little bit of a drizzle.

I did the ride in just under 7 hours. My average was 14.8-- a little slower than what I usually ride, but I think the distance and miserable headwind might account for that.

    height: 6'4""
    weight: 160 +- 5 lbs
    body fat: 5.3-7.3%
    previous experience:
        - 3 year collegiate rower (we trained on the order of 15 hours per week)
        - cycling as of February this year
        - rock climbing as of March
        - comfortable with compound lifts such as the power clean, deadlift, and squats



Currently, my best time up Old La Honda is an unimpressive 25:00. For my training plan I was thinking of doing 3 week cycles with lighter weeks at the end of the training plan. On each light week I can climb OLH as a benchmark. I'd like to lift 2-3 times per week, and occasionally go rock climbing with friends. Here's a very rough draft of how many miles I'd like to ride each week.

    1  : 50
    2  : 75
    3  : 100
    4  : 65
    5  : 90
    6  : 115
    7  : 80
    8  : 105
    9  : 130
    10 : 95
    11 : 130
    12 : 155
    13 : 105
    14 : 130
    15 : 155
    16 : 110
    17 : 135
    18 : 160
    19 : 125
    20 : 125
    21 : 125

This is a 3 week cycle. When I originally got my bike I tried riding 200 miles per week after a few months of very little exercise. It did not go well. I have no problem putting in a lot of hours for training, but I don't want to get burnt out.

So, here's my random collection of questions:

1) I'm aware that the power/weight ratio is generally better for smaller people. I think I'm a corner case here, since I'm tall and very light. Do I have a good body composition to be a strong climber?

2) How many feet should I climb per week?

3) Should I be on a 3 week cycle throught the training plan?

4) Would it be worthwhile to switch in other cardio such as rowing or running?

5) How often shoud I lift?

6) Should I do more or less miles?


Thanks in advance for all the help,

It's been about 8 years since I've ridden my bike, and about 7 since I've outgrown it. For this summer, I must travel ~4km (one way) four times a week, and I think it may be time for me to invest in a bicycle. This will certainly be a healthier and more economical alternative to driving, but I have no idea where to start on my search. 

I do not expect to purchase a bike that will outlive me; I would like something reliable that could comfortably survive a few years of casual use. I expect to mostly ride on paved roads and some trails. I am trying to keep my cost at $300 or less, which looks to be a very easy range to to find mediocre bikes in. I am a 6' tall male and weigh about 170lb. I do not plan to ride aggressively this summer, but if I get hooked, I may take the bike back to school with me come September. From what I know, hybrid or road bike may suit my needs. My friend recommends a mountain bike as a good all-rounder, and I've found some relatively inexpensive ""comfort"" bikes which I know very little about. What should I look for when picking a bike, this doesn't seem as simple as comparing numbers on some spec sheets.  

At the moment, I cannot afford new (or even second hand) equipment from a bike shop and will like to make do with what is available at department stores and trusted online retailers. These are the bikes that I found on sale at Canadian Tire:

I've been doing Starting Strength for the last three months and am making appreciable strength gains. I am still in novice land, though (lifts correspond to novice territory and I can recover in a day), so I am looking at continuing with this for another three months. I'm also a road cyclist and riding season is coming up, which for me is usually five 100-mile rides, between two and four 125-150 mile rides and a bunch of smaller excursions (50-75 miles) in between. Thus, I would like to start focussing on my long-distance (100+ miles) endurance. I care much more more about finishing than finishing them quickly.
While reading Rippetoe/Kilgore's Practical Programming book, I came across an interesting note about sport-specific programming. According to them, high-rep, lower-weight (50-75% 1RM) movements help improve muscular endurance while allowing for strength gains on strength-building days. The way I'm reading this, this means that if I want to be fit and ready for the summer, I can (or should be) programming my rest days for this lighter work while continuing to use the Monday/Wednesday/Friday split for the Starting Strength programme and topping it off with a nice, long (50 - 100 miles) ride on the weekend.



Is this way too much work? If it is not, I'm thinking of doing squats, power cleans and rows on the off days for 3 sets of 12 at 50% 1RM, as these exercises seem most applicable to my sport. Is this a good idea? Or should I just stick to an hour on the trainer on my off days?

The crank needs some work I think (One bike shop told me last year I'd be looking at $600 to fix) - there's some play in it now. I'm gunna go take 'er in for a second opinion. 

I guess my question is - should I be spending money on an 'old' bike, or has technology advanced anything considerably that I'd benefit from a new bike? Is there some point where a $1000 new bike may be a better deal than a $2800 old bike? ;-) 

I feel that this may be one of the rare bike questions that a local bike shop wouldn't be able to answer objectively. (I'm still gunna try that tho)

1355851767.0	1525ok	I bought a bike about two years back, and in less then six months the chain started slipping heavily and no one could figure out what was causing the problem. I'm seriously considering just replacing it, but thought I'd give it one last effort and see if someone can't figure something out. 	Ulairi	13	3	58	"Plain and simply, I don't know shit about bikes and how to troubleshoot something like this...but I've taken it to three different repair shops, two in my town, one up near a trail I used to ride, as well as back to Dick's, where I bought it in the first place. All of them tweaked the gears, cleaned it, reoiled it, and said the previous person had no idea what they were doing, and yet every time they gave it back to me the problem remained exactly the same. 

The bike has had about as little wear and tear as you can possibly imagine, but for some reason anytime even the slightest amount of pressure is applied to the pedals when going uphill; or, when I tired it about 15min. ago; even on flat ground, the chain starts jerking and skipping wildly.

I spent the past hour thoroughly cleaning and reoiling everything, pumping up the tires, and wiping it down from where it had been sitting for the past year or so; then readjusting the gear tension wire things so that the gears changed fluidly as I rotated the pedals with my hands. All the while checking the chain and gears for any kind of damage I might have missed in the past, but to no avail. Everything looked and appeared to be working great, but as soon as I set it down on the ground and actually tried to ride it, identical issue that it had before and I honestly don't know what to do about it. 

So here I am asking if anyone has any possible idea as to what could be causing the issue, I'd be glad to give it a try if you'd be so kind as to explain to me exactly what I need to do. Otherwise I'm going to simply attribute it to being cheap parts and either replace the entire functioning part of the bike or just replace it entirely if I can find a decent deal, as I'm just sick and tired of dealing with it.

I'm losing confidence because I'm more and more sure I'm actually going to be hit by a car someday soon. Is there any tips /r/cycling can give me to boost my confidence and safety?

****EDIT**** Thank you all for your absolutely wonderful suggestions. So I took your advice today and wanted to update you on the results. When there was more than one lane, I rode in the middle of the right-hand lane (American, fyi). Drivers were great about moving around me. One fucker slowed down on my left and hurled profanities at me, but I calmly raised my middle finger at him (thank you ElDudeBro, dhwebb, and jugglist for the suggestions of being more aggressive).  

I added more reflectors and lights to my bike and my body to become more visible (I ride in the dark on the way home from work). It's hard to know how much effect it had, but I'm sure it was useful. 

I also used more communication with the drivers around me, using more hand signals and making eye contact. I  thanked those that were courteous and gave the stink eye to those that were not. 

Overall, my experience was WAY more positive. I felt confident, I felt like I was demanding the respect I deserved, and most importantly, I felt like I was making the best decisions as a bicycle commuter to be as safe as possible. You all are great. /r/cycling needs some more love!

1314587475.0	jxl1r	Where are all the American made bikes at??	rniscior	11	3	39	"Recently I began my search for a possible new road bike. (If the wife will see it my way)  I have been shopping at my LBS's for some time and was thinking to myself ""Why is there nothing made in America in here.""  I'll ask the sales guy at the shop not ""Why is everything made in China or Taiwan here?"" Rather ""Why don't you guys carry anything made in America.""  The answer is always the same. ""Well most bikes are made overseas nowadays, and unless you are looking for something REALLY high end it won't be made here.""  Why do I get the feeling that these guys are full of shit?  I have been doing some research on bikes made in America and I have only found one company (kinda supports their statement) that makes a bike that I would be happy with that's in my price range (about 2300 or less dollars).  There has to be wayyyyyy more manufacturers out there than one or two obsecure companies.  I was not able to see on Cannondales website if they were still ""Made in USA"", and I'm pretty sure that unless it's a high end Madone, Trek is outsourced too.  I know there is the purists out there that will ask ""Why do you want a USA bike, France makes the best, or Italy makes the best"", that may be the case (in some instances) but those bikes aren't made by your neighbors.  I have nothing against those bikes, I just want something home gown if that's even possible.  (Yes I am aware that 99% of the groupsets available on the bike I'm looking for are not made in USA) So I guess my real questions are; Where are all the bikes stamped ""Made in USA"" at?  Does anyone know of any good brands made here at a reasonable price (2300 or below), and if given the choice would you buy American over a fancy French, Chinese, Taiwanese or Italian counterpart if price, and quality were the same?

I am starting to become a more avid riding and have begun doing triathlons, but I don't really have the desire to purchase a triathlon bike. I currently ride a 2004 Specialized Allez Triple Sport that I purchased from someone off of craigslist last year.

I had about 40 minutes of cushion between my expected return time and when the wife would skewer me for being late.

Got the 1st flat at about 15 miles in. Found the bastard thorn, new tube, record setting repair. Off I go at reduced pressure cuz I'm not studly enough to get the mini pump beyond about 65 PSI in any reasonable time.

\#2 at about mile 35. I realized at this point that I did not have my patch kit. Yes! I had a few offers from solo riders for their only spare tube, which I refused. Ug, making the call to the wifey for a pick up... when a wild PYT appeared out of nowhere and offered her patch kit. Awesome. Down to work. Snake bit, requiring 2 patches. Challenge accepted. I confidently waived on the countless other cyclists that offered help. Done!

Got about 50 yards before the patches failed for round 3. I suck. I couldn't find the hole on the first tube. The 2nd was a mess. Clock was ticking.

Within about 2 minutes, a group of spanish riders came along and offered help. Amongst them they had several spares and offered one to me. ¡Muy bien!

CBS cares, so what did we learn today?

* Carry more than 1 spare tube. They're small and light. Really no excuse. Plus, you'll have an extra to help out another in need.

The old bike is a carbon frame with 105 components. The damage to the bicycle consists of a cracked rear seatstay, bent rear wheel, and bent hangar. I *think* that the frame could be ""fixed"" via one of those carbon fixing places, but I'm not sure. The wheel can probably be re-trued, and the hangar replaced.

That all said, I don't want to do any of it really, and I already have a new bike, which leaves me with a couple options:

* Try to sell the bike as a ""fixer,"" making it clear to the buyer the extent and source of the damage

* Sell the components off separately, since all of them are in near-new shape (it was a brand-new bike)

* Strip the components and put them on my older commuter bike (steel frame road bike that I use for commuting)

While I won't be competing in any races, I am interested in upgrading my bike.  I've heard a lot about cyclocross and watch races on youtube sometimes, just how capable are these bikes on the road? I will be riding about 70/30 in favor of being on the road, but don't want to sacrifice the ability to go offroad.

The question I'm trying to ask is, should I get a cheaper cyclocross and get road slicks to swap out, or get a pricier cx bike? Or are neither of these valid options so soon after getting the trek hybrid? I don't know if it's even worth upgrading, I've read it's not a good candidate to be turned into drop bars (flat bars hurt my hands, even with gloves).  I've also tried taking it on some light (really light) trails and the vibrations were really bad, it felt like there was no dampening at all."	t5_2qhyi	True

I recently inherited my father's barely used Peugeot US express. I use it to bike to work and around town and that's it. I want to upgrade it for a smoother ride and a more attractive look.

I don't have a picture of the bike itself but it is similar to this

I've had bikes my whole life but never built/re-built one from scratch. For this bike I'm thinking of converting it to a fixed gear, installing skinnier tires, and changing the handlebars.

My questions are these:

Is this frame compatible with a fixed gear crank system?

Do you have any suggestions of specific parts?

If this were your bike, how would you upgrade it?

What do I need to know for a trip of this length?	nominus	8	0	1	"I'll be going on the full Great Allegheny Passage + C&amp;O bike tour around Labor Day with one other person. We're both experienced cyclists, but not for touring. Right now we're digesting as much online information as possible, but more tips can't hurt.

Framing around Labor Day, we'll have 9 days off to do the whole thing, minus car travel. Aiming for a moderate pace due to my knee injury and some inexperience on multi-day touring. 

* What sort of gear are must-haves? My bike can't accommodate a proper rear rack, but we have a trailer as an option. We're both very small people so heavy gear is a concern.
* Cheap travel options? We're hoping to camp if possible to save money, and do a same-day SUV rental to drive home.
* Pros and cons of starting in Pittsburgh versus DC?
* Must-see places or ideas for a rest day to sight-see?
* Time honored advice from those who have learned the hard way?

I'm excited to do my first tour but it's coming on suddenly, so I appreciate any tips!

http://www.performancebike.com/bikes/Product_10052_10551_1126229_-1_400309__400309

And I love it. Compared to what I've had before and what I've ridden, I absolutely love this bike. 

I've encountered one slightly large problem, the gearing. I don't know a whole lot about mechanics of bicycles, it says it's a 50/34T which I believe may be a compact double. 

My issue is the hills, I'm not doing so well in them. I've handled hills OK in the past as early as last year. I live in Kentucky, long rides will include lots of hills. 

I'll be doing a 100 mile charity ride, which I did last year on a steel frame 80's bike. Gearing didn't feel that bad, I certainly didn't struggle with it aside from crawling a heavy steel frame uphill. 

But now, I'm noticing my low gear isn't quite as low as I'd like, and in order to keep the pedals soft enough to not destroy my energy going uphill, I have to keep a higher cadence, which in itself is destroying my energy going uphill. 

So my only idea to remedy this is to convert to a triple crankset. How difficult/expensive is this to do? Or am I being a chump by not training differently to get up to snuff with this gearing I currently have? That 100 mile ride is in September, and it is rolling hills through the Kentucky country side, I don't know the exact elevation gain, but it's hill after hill after hill. 

Anyway, thanks for any suggestions you guys might have. "	t5_2qhyi	True

After years of skateboarding downtown Montreal, I traded in my board for an old Mercier 200 ten speeds. I've had it for a few weeks and it feels awesome! I noticed a slight problem in the past days, however. 

While going up steep hills, I switch to my smallest gear (sorry if I lack the biking jargon), but after a few pedal strokes, the derailleur shifts me back brutally to the largest one, making the climb a painful and slow torture. I won't argue that it builds leg muscles, but fitness aside, is this normal? Is it a warning sign of a potentially dangerous problem with the bike?

I'll take it to a shop next week but considering I'm a bit clueless about bikes and google searches didn't give me much info, I fear I'll be preyed by greedy bike shop mechanics!

At the moment, I ride about twice a week (looking to increase that) to commute, plus I hike fairly frequently and run a couple of times a week if I have the chance.

I am trying to decide what sort of computer to get - whether it be a dedicated cycle computer, or a watch or something.

I want to be able to watch my heartrate, and if possible, my cadence too (not necessary).

Are the Garmin watches good for riding with? Are there good mounts for when I've got it on my bike?

Conversely, is it possible to take the dedicated cycle computer off the bike for hikes/runs?

I am happy to spend if it's worth it, but would prefer to save money if the additional features of the top-line stuff aren't mindblowing.

So much so standing still they form a 90 degree angle to each other, each one pointing out at about 45 degrees. I can actually walk with my feet pointing almost backwards!

Riding my mountain bike, this is not a problem. When on flats I'm constantly adjusting stance and they can point outwards anyway, and when clipped in the slope of my top tube doesn't get in the way of my knees.

On my road bike with the more parallel to the road top tube however... Well, 3 rides in and I've already dented the top tube with my left knee. The bike is the right size, but when my feet are clipped pointing as straight as I can get them, my knees cannot go anywhere but inwards. I try to not hit the top tube, but inevitably they do.

Just wondering if any other duck footed riders have figured out how to avoid something similar without destroying their knees.

Also, for the time being I've been swapping my MTB SPD pedals until I get a pair of road pedals. Are there other pedals that offer more adjustment so my feet can point out a little more? I'm not tied to Shimano and was thinking of trying either some Time or Crank Bros pedals.

2. I ideally want to purchase a Hybird but somehow it gives me very limited options &amp; in same price-range I get to see those tempting MTBs. But I am not sure if I really need those considering I am just going ride in city.

I've found that my family is very much against me doing an upcoming century ride across our state.  Their main concern of course is that I'm going to be hit by a car and all that aftermath.

I'm trying to stay firm on my intent to do this ride but the guilting has gotten out of control.  They have been through a few tragic deaths and are beside themselves as to why I would ever consider putting myself in any type of risky situation. What additionally doesn't help is that they had the unfortunate experience of seeing a biker get hit in a freak accident.

I've looked up accident reports and statistics and have noticed that a larger portion of accidents that I expected are the result of the biker not adhering well enough to the rules of the road/having alcohol in their system/trying to maintain high visibility/etc.  This leads me to believe that if you take every precaution and pay attention (particularly in intersections) there's a good chance you'll remain unscathed. And of course I'm not saying drivers aren't at fault, they often are.

**So my question is** - have any of you been in the situation where you're trying to calm people around you who are against cycling?  I'd really like their blessing to participate in this event because they mean the world to me, but if not I'd still like to try and make it as easy as possible for everyone.

Resting heart rate 60-65, no body fat really, 5-11 muscular build.  I try not to overdo things with cardio so aim for 30-45mins on the bike every other day.

But my chest got a bit fluttery feeling, strange sensation and my pulse jumped to 150-155 nearly instantly at this time.  I was like wth?  So kicked the bike into cool down mode and concentrated on breathing and slowing my heart down.  It stayed at 150 for about a minute even after slowing down (which usually instantly and quickly drops my pulse), it took about 2-3mins total to calm things down down and get back to cool down of 100-110bpm.  Now I'm not sure what to do about this.  The only time I have felt something similar is when swimming laps about 5yrs ago and I figured I over did it, but it was similar to this however 15mins at 120bpm is usually not much for me at all.  Should I see the doc or see how my next couple sessions go?  I had an unusually large lunch and was still mildly full when I went to the gym, maybe I had too much salt or something.

About a month ago, I was fitted for a Fuji Absolute 2.1. The salesman told me that I was a medium and the bike didn't seem too big or anything but I didn't have a means of getting it home (was going to a bar afterwards) and so I didn't get the bike. Fast forward to Friday when I actually get some time off from work and I step into the shop again. This time I get a woman who remembered me coming in last time and asked me what I was sized at; when I said medium, she was like ""ohhh no, try the small medium"". I did and it also appeared to fit ok; she said the Medium was meant for someone around 5'10"" and it was too big for me. Excited with the idea of having a bike, I walked out with a Small/Medium.
But now I am scared that I actually bought a bike that could potentially be too small for me. I have taken it for a spin and nothing seems off but then again, I don't know enough about bikes to know if something is terribly off. 

I keep finding Youtube videos for how to fit the bike you have to your height but none that are really good for telling if the bike fits you well. Also, the online guides aren't visual enough. 

If anyone can point me in the right direction just so I can sooth my after-purchase anxiety, please let me know.

For reference, this is the bike that I purchased: http://www.fujibikes.com/bike/details/absolute_21. Their bike sizing goes S, S/M, M, M/L, L.

I have been biking daily for my commute for the last year and a half now and sometimes longer distances. The longest I've ever ridden was 16 hilly miles in a day and while I was saddle-sore I wasn't beyond my limit.

some quick google-maps inspired calculations puts the ride at just under 3,400 miles meaning if I wanted to do it in 60 days, I would need to ride 56 miles a day (about 3x my longest ride to date).

I understand I likely need to do some training and this doesn't have to be immediate. Any suggestions for training? Are hilly miles really that much more significant than flat/flatish? Can I expect an easier ride in say... Kansas than I can in Washington?

First, what speeds are relevant? I assume the speed you see most often while cruising isn't, since it doesn't include starts, stops, etc.  

Like today, I did a 30 mile ride by my house, bike path, in 1:34:20 door-to-door. I'd post relevant elevation information if mapmyride wasn't giving me errors. Let me just say it's FLAT. Flat enough to never have to shift off of my 50T. 

Apologies if I seem overly concerned about speed, but I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years of my life, so having a firm, concrete metric like times is something I'm very used to. I like the ability to see (non)-linear progression of training, and the ability for instant comparisons using the relevant numbers.

One of the guys recommended checking out the Cannondale Caad 10 for the same price range. Well I did, and I absolutely love the thing. The problem I run into now is the difference between the Ultegra 6700 and the 105 5700 set. The Caad 10 comes in both but I really don't know if ones is that much better than the other to make up the price difference.

I come to you guys again for recommendations here. I am pretty sure I want the Caad 10 at this point but I cannot see a huge difference up front between the Ultegra with Mavic wheels and 105 with Shimano wheels set ups.

Well recently I've come across some trouble by way of fixing the thing up. I hastily tried to tighten the spokes, which my or may not have been the source of my troubles. The first, and decidedly smaller of problems is that the wheel isn't quite true anymore. If anyone could explain which side to tighten to true the wheel, it would be much appreciated.

The larger of the problems is that part of the tire doesn't fit flush within the wheel well.

The last two show the opposite side of the wheel. The 1st picture shows the part of the wheel where the tire is flush. 

The bulge is on the order of millimeters, but it's been enough to derail the tire and pop the tube once. I took the tire back at the suggestion of my biking friend, and the new one bulges as well. I would expect this is an issue of the spoke tension, but I've tried tightening and loosening  the spokes to no avail.

I purchased this bike a few months ago and haven't done anything with it yet. This is more so out of fear of damaging anything as the person who sold it to me did so at a great price and for a specific reason. He wanted to see this bike back to its old self and not parted out. When I purchased it, it was in pretty decent, not to say that it did need work. I have yet to start on anything really just some work on individual parts. 

Almost everything on the bike was Campagnolo Nuovo Super Record. The seat, stem and handlebars were Cinelli. The bottom bracket and drop outs were also Campagnolo, which leads me to think that this was a pretty serious bike for its time. I can't find anything as far as a serial number, or identifying aspects besides the badge. There is a Columbus seal on the seat tube. The badge has a portrait of a man with Romolo Lazzaretti arching over the top and smaller unreadable text. On the bottom of the badge there's a small wolf facing left. As far as I can tell the white accents on the bike were added on later. 

What should I do with this bike? I've never restored anything myself and I don't want to damage anything any further. I've done some google searches and it's only lead me to find this http://www.lazzarettibikes.com.br/historico-01.html. Any information would be awesome!"	t5_2qhyi	True

Anyway, now the 2011 models are coming out this month, so I'm after some opinions on what to get.

So far my choices are:

* Genesis Croix de Fer - £1100.  I rode the 2010 model and really liked it.  As far as I know, no changes for 2011 except more expensive :/  Steel frame, disc brakes, Tiagra set with some 105.
* Genesis Vapour - £900.  Aluminium body, Tiagra/Sora set.  Like the look/colour of this one.
* Kona Jake the Snake - £1250.  Aluminium body, Carbon fork.  105/Ultegra set.
* Giant TCX 1 - £1200.  Aluminium body, composite fork.  SRAM Rival set.

Originally I could have got a Croix de Fer for £900, which was a good deal.  At £1100, it seems you can get a better spec bike for not much more money.  The Jake the Snake would be top of that theoretical list, but I've not ridden it yet.

I plan to do commuting and some light off road with it.  Happy to take suggestions on top of those ones (though before anyone suggests a Crosscheck, I tried one and didn't like the feel, plus really didn't like the gearchangers at the bottom of the handlebars).  Thanks!"	t5_2qhyi	True

Four times a week I cycle somewhere between 30 and 40 miles at full speed; no coasting except for when the downhill is too steep to sensibly pedal. My bike is a Kona MTB with slicks because my routes usually include a couple of miles of fields. I usually eat and drink the right stuff beforehand and take about 1.5 litres of water on my bike. Occasionally I go cycling having eaten nothing so as to prepare for bonking

So that's me. I'd really appreciate it if the experienced cyclists on here would do their best to answer the following questions for me

1/ How much extra effort will it be to complete a century without stopping?

2/ How do I carry extra water? I use almost all of my water during my normal cycles and I don't want to dehydrate

3/ I'll be using energy liquids and gels of course. How much should I take?

4/ Can I expect to be walking the next day?

If you could give me any help on this it would be great, along with any other tips that you think I might need. I'd really like to complete the century and still be in one piece at the end of it. Hopefully your advice will help me do that :)"	t5_2qhyi	True

I'm 25 and a college student.  When I registered for fall classes a few weeks back, transport was not an issue.  However, my city changed the bus schedule and now it won't work, and its too late to change my schedule.  I've decided to tough it out, and bike to school.

A little backstory-I got diagnosed about 3 months ago with arthritis in my left hip.  I was running before that 2.5 miles several times a week, but since the news I haven't exercised at all (I got kind of depressed).  I heard cycling was a good thing to get into and is arthritis friendly and was planning on taking it up, but I have kids and was home with them for summer so I didn't get any practice at all.  College starts in less than 2 weeks.

My college is 8-9 miles away, depending on route.  The 8 mile route is a highway (speed limit 50), the 9 mile route is a 2 lane road, one lane for each direction (not sure of speed limit, probably 35).  Neither has much of a shoulder or a bike lane (think *maybe* 8 inches to the right of the line).  There are no trails or other practical ways to get there.

So-pointers and advice please!  

-General safety tips
-Tips on riding on narrow roads with traffic
-How to seek out the best routes (I've scoured the Internet but maybe there's something I missed?)
-Tips on riding in the rain 
-Good tips/links on how to easily change the tire on a mountain bike with multiple gears?
-How afraid should I really be? (I'm *really* freaking scared)


I don't have funds to buy a bunch of equipment.  Right now I have the bike (a mountain bike), a helmet, and a lock-all of which I am borrowing from my GF.  I plan on getting a portable pump, replacement inner tube, a small wrench for tire changes, and patch kit for the road in case I need to do repairs, plus maybe carrying a very small medical kit.  I already have tire levers.

Also, I plan on doing a practice ride to estimate time and try to pick out the best (and least dangerous/scary) route.

And what kind of lock would be better? A U-lock or a cable lock? I live on campus at my school so tires and random parts get stolen off bikes often. Is there any way for me to protect my tires from getting stolen? A lock that keeps the tires chained to the bike?

I could have simply waited until next weekend to go to the bike collective, but I was going to be out of the city for the weekend and needed my bike for the trip.

Both of them said that, they could not do that, but that they could install my chain for 12-18 dollars. City bikes, the one that charged me the least of the two, at least told me that I had some other flaws that I should probably fix before riding and was honest that I should probably just wait until I got another opportunity to go to the bike house. However Silver Cycles, the other bike shop, rather rudely told me I should go to the bike collective if I wanted to do that, and then upon learning that I had been teaching myself to repair my bike proceeded to try and sell me 25 dollar bike building books, and 75 dollar bike training lessons from them.

They also had a Peugeot, a Cannondale, some Diamondbacks, and several Department store bikes.  I've read enough to stay away from Schwinn, Huffy, Magna, etc., but are there any other's I should avoid?  Maybe the Peugeot for a lack of easily available spare parts?

**Questions**

* Decent bikes to start with: Trek, Cannondale, Gary Fisher, Iron Horse, Specialized, GT, Kona, Giant.  Any others?  Any you disagree with?
* What's structurally important and what's cosmetic when vetting bikes?  For instance, some were a little rusted.  Does this matter so much? Nothing looked bent or damaged.
* Wheel sizes?  Does this really matter for me at this point?
* I'll be biking with a loaded LLBean backpack most of the time. What handlebars should I be looking into?  I see a lot of recommendations for dropbars, but I'm wondering how that will work with school books over my head.
* How much should I expect to spend?  I feel very fortunate to have the co-op and feel like I could get a lot out of it.  If I spend $100 on a bike, and budget another ~$50 for parts (used co-op parts), is that a reasonable expectation to get something pretty decent going?  I've looked on craigslist, but there doesn't seem to be a lot in this area, unfortunately.  I would like to try and keep things below $200, but I'm not sure if that's reasonable/unrealistic. Thoughts?

I could buy a $4000 bike for $2500 on import from Wiggle, or I could $2500 bike locally for a bike that I know would cost less in the US/Europe or even moreso on Wiggle.

I think it's from the 80s, but I don't know how to tell for sure (can't find a serial #).  Currently it's functional as a sort of jalopy bike, but I'd like to either make it nicer or replace it.  At the very most I could spend like $200 on a new bike, so I'm thinking repairing this Huffy is the most practical option.  But, I'm totally new to cycling, so maybe I'm wrong or would be getting myself into deeper mechanical problems than youtube how-tos can help me with.  Here are the things I'd need to adjust/replace:

-Rear brake - Needs new brake pads

-Front brake - Needs new brake lever, cable, &amp; pads.  Probably the caliper, too

-Shifting system - Ideally I need to replace the entire thing.  The deraulier skips gears and the chain regularly pops off the gears entirely.  The location of the shifting levers is awkwardly located on the handlebar stem.  I can only access 2 or 3 of the 10 speeds reliably.

It's a 36 pound touring bike. It has new tires and is in 100% working condition. I've done a lot of riding on it lately and am enjoying it, but after a 40+ mile bike(generally to downtown and down the lake front and back) ride my legs(mostly thighs) will just burn like crazy by the time I get home. I tried out my friends road bike which weighs next to nothing compared to this beast and riding it (especially speeding up) was such a blast compared to my bike. 

Perhaps this is just a case of bike envy or something but should I look into ditching my retro bike and look into getting something a tad more modern or should I try just sticking with this thing since it's free. Or maybe even upgrading things on my bike like removing the back rack, changing out the steel rims for lighter aluminum and getting better road tires? From my understanding the bike I currently have is fairly rare especially being red(one of the rarer colors for the 74 sprinter) and I've seen listings for it on ebay in the 500-750 range. Perhaps selling my bike and getting something better is in order?

Just got it tuned up and decided to ride it to work yesterday. Work is only .5 miles from home. It's a quick ride. Took it pretty easy. 

On the way home it was dark and there is no bike lane, so rather than ride on the sidewalk I decided to just try to keep my speed up and stay in the slow lane. There was almost no traffic, but I was passed by one car. I definitely felt my muscles working, but it was only a short trip. Everything is fine in the world.

OK. So when I wake up today, my lower left abdomen is in pain. It's pretty bad. It is now about 18 hours after I woke up and I'm starting to think it is muscular, although earlier I wondered if maybe is was a digestion problem. I'm now noticing that it is painful when I try to stand up straight after sitting for a while. I did a search of lower left side abdominal pain and I don't think it is any of the stuff that comes up there. I think I may have pulled or strained a muscle. Weird that I didn't feel it until I woke up. It is definitely only on the left side.

The pain feels like it is in the area of the iliopsoas ""psoas"" muscle, but I don't have back pain, just abdominal pain. At this point I'm not really trying to self-diagnose, just self-monitor. I'm used to this sort of thing. Exercise usually does me more harm than good. I'm a real wake up in pain and this doesn't feel right type of person. That's the long of it.

Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing? Unfortunately, as soon as I picked up the bike I had to park it again. I'm going to feel this out for a while, I'll see a doctor if I need to but I'm hoping it is just a minor setback. Thanks if you read this far."	t5_2qhyi	True

So I have a stock 2009 Trek Soho and I'd like to change the handlebars so that it looks/feels more like a road bike. I just had a few questions about converting the brake levers (avid bb5s) to drop levers. I figured I could just leave the shifter on the upper part of the drop bars, but would it be easy or even possible to set up the two avids with drop style levers ? And if so, does anyone have any recommendations for the type of lever/ handlebar?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"	t5_2qhyi	True

I live on a dirt road that's about a mile and a half long before it hits any pavement, and then another mile or so until it reaches a gas station. I sometimes want to go there to get a drink or a snack, but it doesn't seem worth it to drive my car and walking takes too long. There is also a nice biking trail a few miles down and I might like getting into bicycling for the exercise and fun. I'm looking for a bike that'll do well on the dirt road - which has only minimal spots with light sugar sand - and will also feel nice on pavement. I'm on kind of a tight budget - $200 or less would be ideal. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)

1365311473.0	1bu7e3	12 synapse 5 w 105s, no lbs service vs 13 roubaix w soras, great lbs service	Jpc204	9	3	7	"Looking for first road bike and have ridden alum frame/carbon fork and carbon frames and almost all the gruppo. So far, the gruppo doesn't seem to make a difference except for high high end out of my price range. But the carbon frames seemed to be the best ride. So I'm leaning towards carbon which moves me away from bottom end entry level bikes.

Today I found a shop offering a close out price on a synapse 5, but they don't offer any service with the bike. Another lbs offers lifetime service and fitting but assuming they will match prices with mikes bikes (another lbs with no service having a sale) they would have a comparable bike for 400 less but sora components. Is the downgrade worth the service? Maybe considering I could upgrade the gruppo later?

Any other comments?

One factor I haven't thought of is that it looks like there is a deal on the roubaix sport compact with combo of 105 and tiagra components for the same cost as the synapse. It's a 2013 and at the lbs with service. Maybe that is the best option overall assuming they will match the price and still offer the service with the matching. (I assume there is some margin to do this and that the service is free from their perspective because most people probably don't use it) I'd love to know if people thought they would give a deal on buying 2 bikes.

Loaded question I guess. I appreciate any advice that you have. Thanks!"	t5_2qhyi	True

I'm 5'4"" so I imagine it's going to be slightly difficult to find one that fits me, but Manhattan's CL is obviously very active so there's plenty of options. I just want a cheap beginner road bike, preferable under $200 but I'm willing to go up to $300. My primary goal is to train for triathlons. I know tri bikes are different, but like I said, I just want intro gear. I already know I enjoy cycling since I have a cheap hybrid that I've put a few thousand miles into. I plan to upgrade to clipless pedals eventually. In general, should I stick to bikes newer than a certain time period so it will be comparable with modern clipless shoes? For example, I found this '77 Schwinn Sierra on CL (http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bid/3726616882.html), but I found a bikeforums post by someone saying that the diameter for the hole for the crank arm is too small for modern clipless shoes (in addition to the stem shifter, which I'm under the impression that I should avoid. And I'm pretty sure $200 is overpriced, but what do I know?).

1363902254.0	1arcdh	Need help buying a new bicycle for my 9 year old daughter	frugal_masturbater	7	1	4	"So my daughter wants a new bike. She's 9 and growing a lot, and I am not knowledgeable about bicycles at all.

I could not give a shit and buy a huffy at walmart, but I dislike that approach tremendously. If I go into a bike shop I'm afraid they'll sell me something way overpriced that is no better than said huffy.

I don't know brands, types, anything about bicycles. That's where I hope I can get some recommendations. 

Apparently the one important criterion from her is that it has to have a basket in the front. I want to make sure that is possible (I assume there are standards and said baskets can be purchased as add-ons?)

Otherwise, this will be used fairly casually, not mountain biking or anything particular stressful.

The price is.. I am not sure. Not knowing what I should aim for I can't really budget this very well. Let me put it this way: if people point me at a $100 bicycle and say that it'll be very nice for the number of years it'll be used for, great. 

If it must be $200, so be it. If $150 are nice but $200 are a way better bicycle, I'll spend that. I'm not made of money though, so I won't spend $500 on a child's bicycle.

I expect her to grow quite a bit over the next few years. Tall parents, tall sister and she's gearing up for growth as well so if there are important considerations to look out for, please let me know.

Used bicycle is out of the question because I don't know enough about them and don't want to deal with problems right away; this is a birthday present for her, it needs to be new.

It'd be good if I could purchase this in a physical store in PA, USA.

1360129125.0	17zggl	[Advice Wanted] Road Bike Purchase	rmeredit	9	2	18	"I'm a regular commuter with a flat-bar road bike that I've been using for about 5 years or so.  Over the past year I've started to get into road riding - 60km-100km weekend rides, initially as training for a 200km ride.  I've kind of caught the bug - my regular commuter is ok, but I feel like I'm riding a ford when everyone else is out driving a ferarri.

So - a recent ad for a 2011 Bianchi Sempre caught my eye - $2200 (Australian dollars).  The bike looks in good condition, and about 6 months worth of use.  However, over at Wiggle, they've got a special on the same bike for $1650 or so, plus delivery.  I was thinking of offering $1600 to the seller of the original bike but would like some opinions taking the following into account:

- The $2200 bike is exactly the right size for me.  The Wiggle bikes are 57cm frames, whereas I would normally get a 55cm frame.  Would the extra 2cm rule the Wiggle option out for me, or could it easily be compensated for with seat post/stem adjustment?

- The $2200 bike looks like its had the groupset upgraded to Campy Record (as opposed to the standard Bianchi setup with Veloce).  The Wiggle one uses the Shimano 105 groupset.  Not a $600 difference, I guess, but I'm presuming the Record groupset is a better standard

- The $2200 bike's had the wheelset upgraded to Fulcrum Racing 1.  This might justify the $600 difference, especially in combination with the groupset upgrade.

Should I snap up the Wiggle bike?  Would I be offensively rude/ignorant to approach the other advertiser with an offer of $1600?  I should have noted the $2200 is the initial bid price - 'buy it now' is listed as $2600.  As a road cycling newb, am I overthinking it and should I be looking downmarket for a more entry-level road bike anyway?"	t5_2qhyi	True

Vorpal_Bunny	10	4	13	"So yesterday, a song in my heart and the sun shining, I went to go for a ride and discovered my tube valve was snapped off.  Upon removing the tire to inspect it before replacing the tube, I discovered....well, it's dead.  The wire bead was visible in several places, the reflective sidewall tape was coming off, and bits of sidewall were flaking off.  It's time to send them off to the big pile of old tires in the sky.

Now, don't blame the tires - I've had the bike three years and ridden it over every pothole in the city of Austin.  It's carried bags of charcoal, cases of beer, and whole a couple people (including my neighbor's kids to school once).  It's run over glass, nails, and even gone off road more than once.

The bike is a Surly Long Haul Trucker, and this is the sort of usage I expect my new tires to handle.  They need to be tough as nails, longwearing, puncture resistant, be okay with gravel or packed dirt as well as pavement.  The tires I'm replacing are a pair of Continental Contacts, size 26x1.25 (I really like the size).  

I've looked at simply getting another set of Contis, but I've also looked at the Schwalbe marathon.  But from what I hear, they're gnarly to put on and take off, and heavy as hell.  My LHT doesn't need any help on the ""heavy"" front, but the tires do need to be able to handle the kind of abuse I'm dishing out.  I'm okay with any size from 26x1.25 - 1.75, but I'd like to stay under 2 inches wide.  

I did recently buy my sister a set of Specialized city tires for Christmas, which she loves.  So I just want to make sure I'm not restricting myself or ignoring a good tire because it's not made by Continental or Schwalbe.

Wouldn't mind upgrading the wheelset to a lighter and sportier pair. Almost all decent wheels use a cassete rather than a freewheel. I have been looking at Mavic Aksium as they seem good value.

1354209811.0	1402r6	A few questions about MTB (UK)	Samdroid90	8	4	9	"Hi

I am developing a keen interest in MTB and I want to take my hobby further by riding on more difficult trails.

However, I was discussing trails with a work colleague who said that my current bike would break in half if I rode it on any muddy trail (although I deffo believe this is a bit extreme and there is a tad of elitist about his person).

So let me get to the main points:

1) I own a Carrera Subway 1 (a 2008/9 model) and its listed as a hybrid bike. It seems pretty robust and I've spent some time and money on it, believing that it would be good to use on beginner/intermediate trails without any issue. However this persons comments and a lack of knowledge has knocked my belief that its ok for this use. 

I can post full specs if required.

2) If its a bad idea to put my faith in this bike, then what would be a good starting point? I've been looking at the Felt Q720 and was wondering if this would be any good? If not, on a budget of £600ish (lower is better) what can I get that will last me a few years.

I'm asking because I was about to spend £100 on the crank and bb so I don't want to make ill informed choices with my limited budget.

tl;dr - colleague laughed at bike, got upset, seek advice.

I started doing some training rides the other day on my Peugeot road bike from the 70's.  So far I'm riding 24 miles with some serious hills (it's the loop around central park in NYC). Yesterday I did this in an hour 40 and today in an hour 20.  Does that sound like a solid circuit, maybe a longer ride at slower speed would be more ideal?

Any common mistakes I can look out for before they happen?

Finally, as I mentioned above my bike is old and therefore awfully heavy.  My school's team has some sort of deal with Specialized in which team members get a special deal. Any ideas on what type of bike from them might be optimal, preferably below 2k?

1311102652.0	iu312	How do I pick a good bicycle online?	Qualex	9	1	13	"Reddit, I'm getting married this fall, and my fiancee and I are registering for new bicycles. I've been riding my dad's old bike for the past 10 years, and it's high time I got a new one. But I honestly don't really know what I want, what are good or bad brands, etc.

I typically just ride on the bike path in town, but we've talked about taking our bicycles with us when we go camping, so that would be riding some rougher trails. I also have a friend who goes mountain-biking a fair amount, and I'd like a bicycle that I could take and go with him. I don't need a top-of-the-line bike, just something that's sturdy and reliable enough that it can take some bumps and bruises and keep going.

We're registering at walmart.com, so I'm trying to pick one of those bikes, but it's hard because I don't know what I want, and it's online, so I can't sit on the bike and test it out. I'm 6'2, so I've encountered some bicycles in my day that are way too small for me.  How do I pick a good bike for my needs and size?

I recently bought a bicycle - a Schwinn hybrid. My schwinn is basically a road bike but with straight handlebars just like a mountain bike's. I got it because I wasn't comfortable with the curved road handlebars. 
Later on I got very excited about biking, have been riding a lot and can make quite a good mileage, and I am actually thinking of taking part in a race. I think I might have made a mistake buying the hybrid though. I don't know if I can race with the hybrid without being made fun of by the other cyclists who have the nice road bikes.
I was wondering if anyone has ever been in a race with a hybrid. Is there any sort of assumption by cyclists that hybrids are just for recreation and not 'real' road bikes for racing.

1374504531.0	1itbum	Replacement for stolen '11 Allez Sport ($~2000)	moostapha	10	5	20	"Greetings. My Allez Sport was stolen a little while ago, and I've really been missing my bike. I've got an idea of what I want, but I'm a bit lost. 

I'd consider myself a serious hobbyist, but I have no real desire to do any racing. Maybe an amateur crit at some point, but I doubt it. Focus is fitness and recreation, but I may commute on it some. 

I've only ridden aluminum and steel at this point and pretty much only $1000-range Cannondale and Specialized road and a bianchi cx bike. But, I'm open to just about anything. 

What I want: 

* Drive train: 

    I want something that's at least 105 on Shimano, but I kind of prefer Sram (Apex or Rival is fine). I really hate the way lower-end shimano works...I got my Tiagra/Sora mix transmission stuck god knows how many times because no one could ever get the front adjusted correctly...and I wound up in the big ring for days at a time before I got that terrible sora shifter to let go. Took it to 3 or 4 shops and fiddled myself and never got it sorted, including a cable replacement. So, I'm really hesitant to do shimano at all. No real love for Campy, but I've never ridden it for very long. And I don't want to have to change batteries, not that I want to afford DI2 anyway. 

* Frame: 

    I kind of like more classic lines than, say, an Allez. But I'm not completely married to it. I'd like to be able to carry the bike with either the top tube or the saddle over my shoulder, though. 

    I don't mind aluminum. I don't want to wast energy, but there's no need for an all-out race frame. There's also no-need for super-light. So, there's no real preference on materials, but I do ride in a city (Atlanta). I don't want something so fragile I can't hop those big metal slabs, bad speed bumps, or pot holes. I'm kind of afraid of CF as a result. 

* Ride: 

    Really, what I want is something that turns and descends well but isn't quite as twitchy as my Allez was. Comfort obviously matters, but Aluminum doesn't bother me as long as I've got a nice, firm saddle...which I know I'll have to buy separate. 

* Bars: 

    It's probably too much to ask for, but I'd love not to have to buy classic drop bars the instant I get it. I ***hate*** ergo bars, especially the ones on my Allez. But I will if I have to, since I appear to be in the minority. 

* Looks: 

    No stupid colors. Celeste would be fine, but nothing crazy...I'm not a good enough rider to get away with an intentionally ugly bike. 

Any suggestions? 

Update: 

I went to an LBS for lunch and rode a couple cannondales (caad 10 105, synape alu 105), a trek (domane Ultegra), and a scott (CR1 Team, 105). The Scott seems to have won out of them, but the caad 10 was close. I hit some dirt in a corner and almost bailed on the synapse...kept it up, but it just didn't respond fast enough. Could have been the crappy stock tires, but it still didn't feel right. Domane might have bene *too* comfortable. The CR1 seemed like a good middle ground, but $2100 seems like it might be a lot for a 105 bike, even if the frame feels great. 

After riding several, I'm pretty sold on carbon...everyone seems to think it's fine to jump bumps &amp; plates, and what I did didn't seem to do anything (I try to be kind of rough on bikes on test rides). 

I'm also even more sketched by Shimano. All the way up to Ultegra, they still feel mushy and just kind of wrong. I didn't ride a sram bike today because they didn't have one in my price range, but I'm going to. I remember everything feeling a lot more solid and precise. I know it's all setup dependent, but they just didn't feel that much more right for the money. 

I guess what I'm looking for is aggressive but not too twitchy and Sram Force or Rival (or a mix). And I need to check on my insurance, but if it would cover crashes that break the frame, I'm sold on carbon. 


Update 2: 

I've decided that Sram is worth more than Carbon to me. I was comfortable on Alu before, and I'll be comfortable on it again. I've also kind of decided that I don't like the relaxed geometry bikes as much. The CR1 was impressive, but I rode it right after a much more relaxed bike. And, I feel like they work better for quick test rides without all my gear, but without being able to go on a nice, long high-speed test ride...that's not something I want to change that much. 

Right now, it's the Specialized Comp (Apex) vs. CAAD10 4 (Rival). Specialized is a lot less expensive. I'd love a carbon bike, but it seems like the combination of carbon and sram is hard to come by without spending a lot more money. I could do that, I just don't think it's worth it. "	t5_2qhyi	True

I've had enough of the city (Liverpool in the UK), and so I'm going to take anywhere between 2 and 4 weeks in august to explore europe by bicycle.

I've been experiencing a strange problem shifting my front derailleur into my large front chain ring. 

I have it adjusted so the derailleur goes out to a proper spot (outer limit) my problem only happens when I'm riding the bike though, when I have it suspended and pedaling with my hands shifting through the gears everything is instant and precise. 

While riding I need to shift into my largest rear cog and slide the lever all the way down (downtube shifter) but the chain won't hop up it just rubs in the middle, to get the chain to move into position I have to stop pedaling then the chain hops onto like 3-4 of the teeth then resume pedaling to complete my shift. 

I believe I've adjusted everything properly, if I were to make my outer limit screws go any farther the chain would fall off and my cable is tight in place, the problem only happens while riding and I do keep the pressure off the pedals while shifting as I've read that's what you should do, I have no clue what I'm suppose to be adjusting or what is wrong.

Sun-spex	7	1	16	Right now I have two everyday bikes, a 2012 KHS Flite 220 and a 1976 Centurion Super LeMans. I've noticed that climbing is significantly faster and easier on the Centurion, despite all logic. The KHS has a 50/34 compact crank, a 12/26 cassette and weighs somewhere close to 23 lbs. The Centurion has a 52/42 crank, a 14/26 freewheel, and weighs somewhere around 35 lbs. My best guess is that the gearing on the KHS is actually too low but other than that I'm stumped. 	t5_2qhyi	True

I have recently moved to London and acquired a Raleigh stowaway bike. It's same as this one: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/4237062456_eb9e83645d_o.jpg

I rode BMX for many years, and enjoy bunny-hopping around etc. Wondering about the following:

1/ Does anybody know how strong the bike is, and how much strain it can take? Is it safe for me to be jumping around? I've done a little mild stuff but a bit nervous about pushing it.

2/ How could I mod this bike to make it stronger? I've already put new large peddles on, but what else could change? I'm thinking perhaps new, stronger handle bar, and that long direction shaft seems to me as it's the weak point of the bike. Any suggestions?

Thanks"	t5_2qhyi	True

1370827913.0	1g0m0b	Looking buy my first real bike in a long time, where do I start?	JoeyPhats	7	2	11	"So I'm a pretty big guy, 6'3"" about 300+ pounds.  You'd be hard pressed to think I'm quite that big to look at me but there it is. Anyway I'm finally finishing college (11 years and 2 kids later) and I want to start to get in shape (I quit smoking in Dec and have been eating better than ever) and I've wanted to start bike riding.  I've wanted a bike for years and have finally decided to buy one.  So my question is, where the hell do I start?  I don't plan on doing any 90 miles races anytime soon, I just want something that I can use to improve my cardio and hopefully shed some pounds (I really hate the gym and would much rather ride a real bike than run on a treadmill or use a stationary bike). I would mainly be riding on trails and roads in the Philadelphia suburbs and possibly in town a little. So i don't know if road, mountain, hybrid or whatever is the way to go. I work with a few guys that ride but I figure I'd start here first before asking to ride their bikes as test drives. :-)

Any help you cycling guru's can give would be great!"	t5_2qhyi	True
1370791903.0	1fzg66	3 months without a bike; desperately want to build up my cycling speed and stamina for triathlon	Psyyx	7	2	5	"Hey r/cycling!

I will be travelling in the US for the coming 3 months, and won't have a bike available to me. I will be running and swimming while there, but the cycling part of triathlon is the thing that needs the most improvement. 

I will have a very basic weightroom available (barbell, some dumbbells). I'll be in a hilly area, so will be doing a lot of runs with big elevation changes.

How do I build up my cycling base so I have something to build on this fall/winter?"	t5_2qhyi	True

During my second ride I started noticing a creaking noise in the front of my bike. I can't really isolate what part or joint it's coming from. It kind of sounds like a creaky old porch swing.

1370203710.0	1fjb3h	Hope it's ok asking here, but I know absolutely nothing about bikes. I was wondering if anyone could give me a ballpark estimate of what a bike my father-in-law left me is worth.	GoShogun	10	5	8	"The bike is way too big for me so I can't use it so I listed it on Kijiji for $100.  It's a Nishiki road bike, and I have no idea what model or how old it is.  I guess it's in decent condition but I really know nothing about bikes.  
  
The only reason I ask here is because as soon as I posted it, my inbox was flooded within the hour with people all wanting to come right away to see it.  So now I'm wondering if it's worth more than the $100 asking price I listed.

1370019632.0	1few8o	[RESTORATION] Help with identifying the correct extractor tool for my lower bracket.	MusikLehrer	8	1	3	"OK so I'm restoring a late 1970's FUJI (S10-S; the serial is 78C10630 if that helps) and I need help identifying the correct size extractor tool for my bottom bracket. 

I know this is probably a newbie question. I need to get the bottom bracket assembly off so I can sand down the frame and paint (and clean up and grease the bearings, clean up to gears etc.) 

How do I figure out what type of extractor I need to use? Is there a way to safely get the bracket assembly out without using an extractor?

What makes the budget possible is the fact I'll consider a vintage bike with just the right specs. 

Would you have any suggestions or things I need to consider?

1369886223.0	1fbe8n	I have a big head and can't find a helmet that fits.	Aerik	7	3	4	"Been getting back into biking this season.  I've got a new bike, a head/tail light set, comfy shoes, sleaveless shirts and compression shorts to wear, and even a loud bell.  The only things I'm needing right now are a bag, which is easy to get on my next check, and a helmet.  But damned if everywhere I go my head is too big. No strap will go even close to around my cheeks and chin.

Anybody know a good store/site that sells helmets with a _really_ adjustable strap or something?

Thanks for your (positive) input!

1369839187.0	1f9rdq	You only have 500 dollars to spend: $500 professional repair, $280 self-repair or $500 brand new bike?		13	8	21	"I have a 2004 Novara Randonee Road Bike that I got from my dad. When it was functioning well, I loved the way it rode, I loved the fit, everything. However, now it is very broken down. The frame is still in good shape, however just about everything minus the handlebars and seat will need replacing or repair. From the bike stores that I have checked in DC, the labor is about 200 or so, meaning the parts would run me about 300. 

So the question is, should I pay for the repair, go to some where like www.thebikehouse.org and learn how to repair my bike with my own parts, or buy a cheaper new roadbike from a department store like [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Cycle-Force-Tour-de-France-Stage-One-Elite-55cm-Road-Bicycle/15382686#Product+Reviews).

also if you could direct me to a cheap craigslist roadbike that you deem to be good, that would help as well. 

Also i'm 5'8"" so i think I would need a 54cm to 55cm frame.
