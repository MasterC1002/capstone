I’ve got a cold and I'm staying home from work today, but I’m already bored so I’m sending out this offer.  My last offer post was a lot of fun, but unfortunately I can’t link it because the subreddit r/randomactsofdrawing has suddenly gone private and rude (if anyone knows what happened there I’d love to know, I mean, I posted like a dozen cool drawings there that even I can’t see anymore).

Anyway, I’m not drawing 150 different things like some other overachievers on this subreddit (props to them though), so I’m giving you a theme:

Describe a monster or creature and I’ll draw it.  You can make up something weird, or if you’re not feeling very creative, maybe describe an actual animal and see how much I mess it up.  I’ll draw until I feel like not drawing anymore, that sounds fair right?

**Edit: Alright alright, enough with the requests, I'll still work on the ones here soon though.

1356908721.0	15oz6w	[Meta] Regarding tattoos and commissions. 	tptbrg95	67	8	30	"Hi everyone!

When I first started this subreddit lots of people told me that I shouldn't allow free graphic design work here.  That was a while ago, and this subreddit has grown exponentially since then.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter so we can come up with some guidelines for this type of stuff.

Please upvote this for visibility, blah blah self post no karma.

Thanks,

tptbrg95

Edit:

The reason the rule was first implemented was that, as ghostcat states, ""it was always supposed to be an outlet for people to be creative off of random ideas"".  I didn't originally intend for this to be a place for graphic design to be done, free or paid.  There seems to be a lot of desire for GD work here, and I also don't want GD artists to feel like they have to do work for free.  That's why I'd like to know what the community wants.

Basically, do you want this subreddit to be more about random creativity, or more about fulfilling graphic design requests?

I see two choices:

1. Keep the rule requiring art to be free, and disallow graphic design here  

2. Get rid of the free work rule and allow GD. 

If you want the first option we can always create another subreddit for commissions. 

And if you see any other potential solutions, leave a comment"	t5_2sqsz	True

IAmMosh	63	12	16	"A few months ago while under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms, I had this vision of a being that was very soothing and calming. I like to think of it as some sort of embodiment of my self-conscious. Think what you will about its legitimacy, but it struck me. It was a sort of anchor for me during the trip, and my mind goes back to it frequently, in points of stress (even when sober).

I'm hoping to make it a little more concrete, and if you guys could even do a rough sketch of the stuff I've described, I'd greatly appreciate it. I guess what I'm asking is, can you guys turn the vision in my head into a tangible image?

Here are the traits I can remember:

    Stands upright like a human. No tail or anything extra in the body section.

    Feminine form, but very powerful looking. The way the statue of david looks though, not like a bodybuilder. It was in all aspects female, but for some reason I knew it to be genderless.

    Dark grey-blue skin. 

    Flesh reminded me of the creatures in the tool video for schism

Now the crazy part. The head/face.

    Had a very feline face. Nose/eyes were definitely feline, but the mouth was more human (not the sort of cleft :3 look that cats typically have) with thin lips.

    Head came to a dull point above the forehead. Not sharp at all, more like the way your elbow comes to a point when your arm is bent, but slightly more acute.

    No ears

    Horns protruding horizontally out of the head with the point curling down, and ever so slightly inwards, but not enough to make a full spiral.

    Skin seemed to be battle-damaged, but long healed over. Like an old scar.

If you guys can help, it would mean the world to me. In my vision, it was in an empty blackness, and it was just this thing talking to me.

Cheers, have a great week.

Everything I draw will be a pencil drawing and uploaded via scanner. I would color but I don't have photoshop at the moment.

[Edit:] I just want everyone to know, if I don't reply to your comment, it's not because I'm ignoring your request. I'm just waiting until 9pm EST to see how many requests add up, then I'll start the drawings. 

[Edit 2:] This is getting pretty big, a lot great requests. I'd just like to ask everyone that sees this to not post any requests after 9:30pm EST, just so I don't get confused and have to do math to figure out if you made it under the twelve hour mark. Thank you.

[Edit 4:] I'm in the process of moving at the moment, it might be a while until I can upload again. I will be drawing the requests though, it will just be a while until I can upload them.

I haven't been on recently, but I do have five of the requests drawn, I just have to buy a new scanner. It should be tomorrow when I can upload them, maybe Tuesday. Then, I can get back on track to drawing all of them.

1363968111.0	1aszdf	[Request] The Adventures of Tentacle Girl and Toy Boy 	boocawkeh	43	11	7	"Okay so this may seem like an odd request but oh well. So my GF and I were talking and somehow it got into us teasing each other about our odd fetishes. Hers being tentacles mine being toys. She then said something about ""The Adventures of Tentacle Girl and Toy Boy"" so I thought that would be a funny thing to see visually.

What I'm picturing is a sort of super hero theme. I imagine tentacle girl having a lower body completely made of tentacles and the upper half a normal female body. She has blonde hair by the way. 

As for the ""toy boy"" character, I'm imaging a normal guy who is wielding something similar to one of those big purple dildo bats from Saints Row 3, and maybe some other types of ""toys"" implemented into the drawing if anyone could think of anything.

A big thanks to anyone who could do this for her and I!"	t5_2sqsz	True

I'm looking for a specific kind of look and don't know if there is one out there or maybe one of my fellow redditors is a good artist and wouldn't mind drawing what i have in mind. What I'm picturing is a group of Ents including Treebeard are marching towards you holding weapons like stones and whatnot with a burnt forest in the background. The whole picture would be within a circle and in the lines of the circle i would like the quotes from the song ""Last march of the Ents"" in its original language of the song.

When they finish the paper, its transferred to the faculty offices on conveyor belts. The faculty all have bags of rice, and for each article the slaves are given a certain amount of rice, say a cupful, on a different conveyor belt.

This could all be done in a comic strip manner, with a citation stating ""The real university.."" following the picture, or something like that.

1363079379.0	1a50tn	[Request] Please draw my nightmare. I'll explain why.	Sepherchorde	29	7	41	"The explanation is fairly straight forward: I have had night terrors since I was rather young, and no matter the night terror there is one thing that is always there. I am 26 now and my night terrors are now rare, but much more intense, and I feel that if I can look at this thing in a picture format, I might be able to get my brain into the gear of ""this isn't real"" when I have one.

So, as for how it looks:

It's about six feet tall, humanoid and hunched over with abnormally long arms and hooked claws coming off of it's fingers. It's head is somewhere between a human and a cheetah, but with decidedly human ears. It is always grinning. It carries a large crooked knife, and it is skinned. It just has no skin on it.

If anyone can, thank you in advance.

EDIT:

/u/Merinovich has gotten the image that is closest to what I see in my night terrors, and I greatly appreciate the image, even if it disturbs me a great deal for now. I am hoping that it helps me to ""fight back"" so to speak and get my night terrors to finally ease off.

~~As the title so quaintly suggests, **ITT you may ask me to draw something.**  Anything.  *Almost.*  You clever, clever redditors have prompted two new rules, proving nothing goes without saying.  Still, nothing therein impinges upon the original spirit of the post, so we're good there.~~


~~The rulz:~~

~~*1. Keep it brief--if you can, explain the drawing in a single sentence.~~

~~*2. Link references of real people, places or pets.  I can't draw your brother, Bob, if I don't know what he looks like.~~

~~*3. No licensed characters, please.~~

~~*4. Keep it SFW.  I post these on my official [fb site] (http://facebook.com/emeldi.art) (""Like"" it today!) and then link them back here.  If you want something you wouldn't show to your mom, email me for a commission (michael (at) emeldi-art.com).~~

~~*5. If I drew for you last week, please leave room for people who have not yet had a drawing.  If you really, really want another picture drawn, my commission rates are nice and cheap.~~


~~Other than that, go nuts!  Last week we had some great submissions (you can view them [here](http://facebook.com/emeldi.art) along with my other stuff).  I'll draw requests in the order I receive them, and I'll keep going until my hand gets tired.~~

I'm not an artist, so could you guys could somehow create a drawing of a mixture between the two? I'd be eternally grateful if anyone even did just one of them at all; however, IF you were to do them in color, I'd like the following hair color (and possibly an extra detail) for each drawing. Here are the combos:  

Loki = Ariel: Loki's color hair, but Ariel's style. Also, if you could somehow replace Loki's scepter with a trident, that'd be great.  

Thor = Rapunzel: Obviously blond hair, but longer than Thor's. Also replace his hammer with a frying pan, please. 
 
Captain America = Cinderella: Blond, but with Captain America's hairstyle.  

Iron Man = Snow White: Iron Man's color hair.  

Black Widow = Merida: Even though they both have more ginger hair, the person to which we assigned them has a lighter reddish blond color.  

Hulk = ambiguous: We never had the chance to assign this Avenger a princess, so you can choose! No additional details needed.  

Finally, this is only choir member who has something other than a Disney Princess:  

Hawkeye = [Jack Frost](http://i.imgur.com/jLFk7.jpg) from Rise of the Guardians. No additional details needed.  
The characters of importance are arranged from top to bottom. So, if you were to do just one of them, one of the first three would be amazing! Ask if you need any additional details."	t5_2sqsz	True

[Here's an album of stuff I've done the past.](http://imgur.com/a/Pr0rC) Stuff'll look a bit different with a different medium, but you get the idea.

I'm best at animals, people, fantasy creatures, etc. Fanart is always fun - I especially like mashups between series :) Ill start in about an hour and do as many as I can -wooooo.

Sorry, but no NSFW stuff.

Edit: By the way, if anyone wants any of these originals pm me, I'll send pretty much any of them to you for $5 (pretty much just to cover the time and cost of sending it) as long as you're in the US. If you're in Canada $6 is probably enough. The colors look a bit better irl since I was using a crappy cam. I have way too much art sitting around my place as it is, and it'd be a shame to toss them all. They're all on 8.5 x 11 sheets of regular paper.

Edit 2: I managed to do [19 drawings for you guys](http://imgur.com/a/cObC0) - a new personal record! I had fun, but I've gotta do some actual paying work now - although I might be tempted to do one more in order to hit 20, if an idea amuses me enough.

It is a small, hairless creature with a hunched back. It is a ghostly white color, and has backwards knees, similar to a bird. It's spine has jagged spiked that jut from it's skin, and it has long, spider-leg like fingers, three on each arm, and I say arms because it doesn't really have palms.

When I was a kid I used to have a lot of nightmares about the world being destroyed, and it got me to start thinking about what I would do if there was an imminent end to the planet.

In my dream, I see a boy and a girl sitting on a grassy hill (maybe overlooking something, like a town or valley) and staring up at the asteroid, which is being magnified by the atmosphere to look huge, like the moon is crashing down on the Earth as though the entire planet can all look up and see it at once no matter where you are.

I'm not sure what the boy and girl would be talking about. Probably reminiscing about a childhood together, or talking about things important to them. They are obviously not happy about the asteroid, but content that they get to spend time together before the end. They are not dating or married. They just enjoy each other's company.

I see a lot of colors in the sky, like a sunset, but more dissonant. The asteroid is almost a source of light in itself because of the various metals of which it's made.

I'm not sure how this will turn out. Please feel free to use any medium available or place your own twist on it."	t5_2sqsz	True

I was alone in a park, and as soon as I finished taking my first hit, I grew about 10 extra pair of arms. All of them were flailing violently and I couldn't control any of them. Then gravity starts switching directions on me. Instead of pulling me down towards the earth, I'm being pulled to the side. At this point, a giant arm reaches out of a nearby fence. The hand at the end of it had a white glove on, similar to Mickey Mouse. It picks me up in the air and throws me to the ground (I still have no idea what really happened there). As I look up, the sky turns into a thousand kaleidascopes, continuously splitting and merging. Next to me is a red playground, and as I focus on it, it transforms into the blade of a giant ax. The Mickey Mouse hand from before grabs the handle of the ax and uses it to try and chop at me. I start running in slow motion towards the gate, which has turned into a giant mouth of chomping teeth. For some reason I know that if I can make it out, I will be safe. I keep running in slow motion and eventually make it out of the gate, at which point things calm down and I am left with just a light afterbuzz and the houses around me swaying slightly in the wind.	t5_2sqsz	True

1369926939.0	1fc96p	[Request] Creature from my nightmares	aDetectiveOraPervert	21	0	2	"Okay, story time. 
I've had the same dream regularly since I was about 12 years old -19 now- where I'm driving in a car with my family and our car collides into this figure on a busy street. 

A man staggers out of the wreck and shoots us what is a some sort of scowl, grimace and terrifying cheesy grin. I can see that his face is horrifically scarred, but not from the accident. The scars are a mixture of old and new, from numerous time periods. I get a disgusting sense that they are the results of various attempts to tear at his own face. He dashes away from the crash, crawling and scurrying over the wreckage. 

The dream cuts to me in the garage inspecting the car. It's completely totaled. The bonnet is crushed like tin foil and all of the glass is shattered. There is no way that anything could have survived being hit like that. 

As I look on I hear this demonic chuckle. Somewhere between a witches cackle and a deep beastly roar. As I look to the source I see the figure in a painting on my wall. I am horror struck and cannot move. He begins to crawl towards me, out of the painting, clawing at the frame as he goes. At this stage I black out and awake in cold sweats. 

There are variations to the dream, sometimes I'm trapped in paintings with him, famous landscape works that I swear I've never seen before and then months later come across them for the first time in the waking world to my terror. 

The dreams have been getting worse lately, more frequent, more vivid. I would just love a physical manifestation to be able to see in the waking world.

Description: Short to average height with a very gaunt figure which hints and wiry strength. Poor, hunched forward posture. Horrifically scarred and thinning face with stringy, bonewhite with hints of yellow green hair. Full and foul mouthed intimidating grin. He's always appearing in a victorian era suit, with coat tails, top hat and a black, steel tipped cane. Because of the cane and his gaunt figure, I at some point began to call him ""The Pin Man"".

TL;DR Horrifying figure been haunting me since late childhood, would appreciate attempts to bring him to life. "	t5_2sqsz	True

Frodo: Fozzie Bear

Gandalf: Dr Bunsen Honeydew

Saruman: Waldorf

Gollum: Swedish Chef

Sauron: Animal

Legolas: Beeker

Gimli: Kermit 

Sam: Scooter

Bilbo: Gonzo

Elrond: Stadtler

Aragorn: Sam the Eagle

Boromir: Rowlf the Dog

Arwen: Janice [edited, was mistakenly named as Lips]

I went to a jeweler with a basic concept and they can do it and gave me a price and all that already. The ring is going to be custom made and will be put into a CAD program once I send them a more polished drawing of what the ring will look like.

This is the inspiration for the ring: view the Little Mermaid ring on the right...
http://imgur.com/IyW7PJo

I am pretty much making this type of ring but in the theme of The Lion King instead. My girlfriend loves this movie and is going to love this ring more than anything.

In place or Ariel, will be young simba. Instead of flounder (the fish), I would like to incorporate Zazu (the bird) but I'm not 100 percent sure it's possible yet..but would like to try and get him in there for the concept..

The diamond isn't going to have any fancy supports like that ring shown, it will just be a standard holster.

In place of the sea shells and whatever else is on that ring, I need some design elements..rocks or whatever is relavant.

**I am willing to give someone an hours pay to do this.
I will also show you the ring when it is done.**

Ring constraints must be kept in mind, but they don't have to be thought about too much because once I send the drawing along, they will tell me if they need to change anything for it to work. But the Little Mermaid ring is a solid example of what can be done and what I want done..minus the special diamond holder.

~~Welcome back, friends!  As many of you already know, **ITT you may ask me to draw something for you.**  There are some rules, though.~~

The rules:

*1. Keep it brief--if you can, explain the drawing in a single sentence.

*2. Link references of real people, places or pets. I can't draw your son stealing cookies if I don't have a picture.

*3. No licensed characters, please.

*4. Keep it SFW. I post these on my official fb site (""[Like](http://facebook.com/emeldi.art)"" it today!) and then link them back here. If you want something you wouldn't show to your parole officer, email me for a commission (michael (at) emeldi-art.com).

*5. If I drew for you last week, please leave room for people who have not yet had a drawing. If you really, really want another picture drawn, my commission rates are nice and cheap.  Send your request to michael (at) emeldi-art.com.

~~Other than that, go nuts! If you're stumped for ideas, see some of the past submissions [here](http://facebook.com/emeldi.art) (along with my other stuff). I'll draw requests in the order I receive them, and I'll keep going until my hand gets tired.~~

But not just any hotdog with a face.  

**If you don't need any inspiration then please don't continue reading this, and you especially don't want to continue reading this in Morgan Freeman's voice.** 

Give it some emotion.  

Make it angry. Maybe it wasn't cooked right, or it knows it's high in cholesterol and salt and wants to make you fat.  
Or make it happy, maybe it's full of *joie de vivre* or gleeful in the way that only youth can be.  
Or seductive. It knows how bad you want it in your mouth, how your mouth waters just thinking about the way it tastes.  
 
Portray it as an action movie heroe, if you like, or an angel, or an animal, or an Indian deity with lots of arms, a celebrity, or any combination of these sorts of things.   

Put it in a situation if you so desire.  
Perhaps a mother hotdog fiercely protecting its cocktail-sized young, or a valiant hero's last stand, maybe an evil wizard casting a dark spell, or a doctor operating on himself.

While I still have a huge amount of things to learn, I will try at drawing whatever ideas you'll give me. If you want your drawing to be made in a specific style, it would be awesome if you'd tell me and/or provide me with an example image.

There is a little downside, though, and please be aware of it: **Your request will take time.**

I'm not in the USA or Canada, but rather in central Europe, so there'll be quite a bit of time difference (it's about midnight here now, for reference). As I'm a rather slow drawer, I might take half an hour to an hour for your request, so it will be accumulating. I'm sorry in advance!  
But, perhaps, if you are patient, give me a chance and I'll do my best. :D

EDIT: And that's it! Thank all of you who requested a picture from me. It was a nice experience, I had a blast (*and* was able to practise!) I wish all of you a happy, successful and fluffy new year or, as we'd say in my home country: Guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!

A picture of a horse riding a rocking horse

A horse in full polo gear, on the saddle of a mighty stallion

A horse-drawn carriage, piloted by a horse

A bit more about my son in the hopes of helping; he loves music, and he loves to dance! He is such a happy, colorful guy that has this way of wrapping everyone up in his presence. He is always laughing and is super affectionate. He is a very strong little guy, in fact at just 2, he is the strongest person I know.

If you have any hand-drawn images which you would like to be turned into digital vector based images, just post them here and I'll do my best.

Some things you might want to consider before submitting your drawing:

1) This process works best if you upload a high quality scan or photo of your drawing.

2) The results will be in [this](http://i.imgur.com/u98qo.png) style, so portraits and non-cartoony images might not turn out quite well. You can still upload them and I will try it, but try to keep it simple. As you can see, the colors and shadows don't 'blend over into eachother' with this style, so try to have a consequent color-shadow line in your drawing too.

3) Keep in mind that I'm a beginner and a student,  so it might take a while before I deliver! Don't worry though, I'll be around here for the next couple of days/weeks trying to complete as many requests as I can.

1355605715.0	14wrqb	[REQUEST]A picture of the earth with a manned satellite in the foreground for a short film I'm writing.	Jasonresno	18	3	5	"Hey guys,
  
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
So I make short films for a hobby (as well as act) and I'm getting into preproduction on a new project right now. It's a science fiction film about these manned gun satellites that ring the Earth to protect the planet from alien objects that keep colliding with the earth whilst avoiding conventional defenses.
  
The story is about one character and the loneliness he endures as he staves off these inhuman and emotionless assaults. There's a lot more that goes into the story but I won't get into too much else.
  
ART CONCEPT  
So for the poster I wanted to show the earth in the background and the satellite (artists interpretation) in the foreground. All that I really need to be shown is some sort of firing device. I want to show how lonely it is for this guy to be working alone so far from Earth, while showing what he is working for.

GRATITUDE  
This poster would be used to drum up excitement for the project and would be posted across all of our social media platforms (reddit/facebook/twitter/official website) you would also be listed in the credits of the film as well as the IMDB (if you wish). I can't promise the project will blow up but I'm confident that it's going to be seen by a decent amount of people and probably wouldn't hurt if you are trying to get exposure.

TLDR- Short film about manned-weaponized satellite. Need poster (artists interpretation) depicting the Earth and the satellite at the same time. Good exposure, grateful crew. Thanks!"	t5_2sqsz	True

It spread all the way to the horizon and farther, and instead of a cartoon city, it was designed to look the world. Mountains rose up, but i was a giant so they only came to about my shoulders. Deep rivers were about the width of my arm. The ground was rocky or sandy depending on what part of the world i was on, and big cities were tiny jumbles of buildings the size of my head.

you see from the back a small girl +-5 years old in a balerina outfit, and holding her hand on either side is a man on stilts walking next to her. The three of them together are walking down a road with stalls (Almost like a flea market but empty) on either side of the road with rain pouring down and the moon in the distance.

I know its a tedious request but if anyone can help me out with this it will really be amazing. I wont be able to offer anything in exchange except the satisfaction of making a dream a reality. Thank you to anyone who takes on this project.

Most importantly, I have no artistic ability, can't even draw stick figures. I would be eternally grateful if anyone could help me and do a few drawings. Doesn't have to be fancy, I was envisioning more of a cartoon or kids book illustrations.

My little sister is 18, I'm 21, and she loves studying dinosaurs. She's had a pretty rough year, and we spent last christmas in the hospital with my dad, long story, so this year I'm hoping to do something special for her to cheer her up and show her how much I love her and her help through everything.

TL;DR I'm hoping someone will help me with illustrations for a book I'm making for my sister for xmas"	t5_2sqsz	True

1352612350.0	12zyv8	[Request] I would like someone to help me visualize a hallucination of a demon I had during a recent episode of Sleep Paralysis	Simpsoah	18	4	18	"Hey all,

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. The demon may be fairly easy to draw for some of you, but I don't have the ability to make it myself. 

I've done a bit of research on Sleep Paralysis as I have roughly 5-6 episodes every time I try to sleep. It seems that there is a correlation between these demons and Sleep Paralysis and it would be great if someone could parse through the vague details below and help me recreate it as a reference. 

* I was sleeping on my back when this happened. I could see the demon was crouching above me at about waist level (kind of like [this](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9400000/neytiri-crouching-james-camerons-avatar-9473058-634-286.jpg)) and looking directly at me. 

* It's entire body was pitch black. I remember it being darker than anything I could imagine, it even stood out so vividly against my already dark room. This made it a little difficult to differentiate where it's body, arms, and legs crossed. 

* The body of this thing was thin. There was a slight inward curve like it was malnourished. The curves here were the only non-linear features of the entire creature. The arms and legs met at a point (I remember the knees being so sharp that I thought I would cut myself if I were to touch it). 

* There were these plates that came out of it's elbows and knees (I Googled elbow blades and [this](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/327/a/2/raphael_elbow_blade_by_young9tradition-d33gxyl.jpg) is the closest example I could find). These plates were straighter and thinner (as thin as the arms) than what is shown in the link and they were about as long as it's torso.

* It's fingers were about 6x longer than a normal human finger. The tips also came to a really sharp point. I remember at one point, the demon pressed his fingers on my torso and they pierced through my skin with little effort. 

* The face was very pointy as well. The chin came to a sharp point, and the eyes were piercing, red, and came to three points I believe. 

* The top of the arms and the head had smoke constantly floating upwards (the smoke was the same color as the body, so I couldn't determine the shape of the top of the head or the arms). The eyes had the same smoke effect, but they were emitting red instead of black. 

* I don't recall this thing having a mouth at all. If I remember that it did, or if I see it again, that is something I can have someone add later.

I hope this is enough detail to give you a rough idea of what I saw. If you need any more information, please let me know. I would really appreciate seeing this thing. It might put it out of my mind and let me move on."	t5_2sqsz	True

Streaks of clouds lead toward the sun.

1371936782.0	1gvjaz	[OFFER] I will draw 10 headshots of your OCs - at my discretion	necromanticize	14	2	46	"I will draw and fully color headshots of your original characters, and I will do 10 of them - but I will be choosing which 10 I want to do.

There are certain things I can and can't draw, and some things I'd like to work on more. So if your character is a bit too boring, I may choose not to draw it. On the flip side, if it is too complicated, it's likely I will pass over it as well.

I also need a reference picture since it is not impossible but slightly difficult to get your character right just from a description. I don't want to screw it up, y'know?

But if you need to add a little extra information to help me out, feel free to add a blurb about their personality/age/career/anything else you think would help me accurately draw them.

EDIT: I really would like to do commissions but I don't know if my work is good enough. If you don't have a character you want drawn, or have already requested one, would you mind taking a look at the finished art and letting me know whether you would find it worth it to order a commission from me? And if so, what would the price range be? Thank you.

1371536427.0	1gkjkg	[request] anyone care to help a guy without the use of his hands visualize his future tattoo?	BenUrAwesome	15	2	6	"So, I'm trying to solidify an idea I've had for a while now but I can't draw or clarify it myself due to a spinal cord injury that affects my hands. I don't want to show up at a shop with nothing to to go off of.
First off I'd like it to be a full lower sleeve done with black and grey line.
The idea behind it is from Disneys The Beauty and the Beast. More precisely that Beast wasn't able to get belles love before the last rose petal fell. And subsequently had to live with the notion that he was doomed to be the beast forever, living out his days as a creature he thinks that no one will ever love...
I'd like to see what someone would draw with that pretense in mind... In my head I see it as a graphic almost batman style comic book take on the beast. (Kind of similar to zombie princess' but without the gore and solid color) Maybe perched on a castle spire but of course I'm completely open to interpretation.
I can't do this myself and the only thing stopping me is a clear idea of what I would like to present to the artist.
And of course that the artist is talented enough to do it well enough to be a lower sleeve piece that will be very visible. I live in denver.

I've just invited u/shittypaintings to be a moderator so if he accepts hopefully he can help things run more smoothly. I also might put up a meta post looking for an additional mod but I'm not sure yet.

Anyways, the winner of our last contest was u/the_disreputable_dog, who compiled art found on this subreddit from racheal1991, el_frou, teasprout, thediscobison, thomasatnip, moosehairunderwear, BaconPancakes1, Benkislap, Desc3000, xxcloolessxx, covertwalrus, ZombifiedRacoon and herself into [this great header!](http://i.imgur.com/Hfl5gUg.png)

**Contest #11:**

Rules:

* Picture must have dimensions **1024x105**

* Picture should include the subreddit name

* Nothing NSFW

Aside from that, you have artistic freedom. The most highly upvoted comment will be selected.

If you submitted your design in a previous contest you can resubmit it for a current one as long as you weren't the winner.

**Regarding contest length:**

I'm thinking it would be good to have each header run for 2 weeks.  1 week seems kinda short and a month seems too long.  We'll actually be on top of changing the headers from now on.

Was wondering if someone could draw my two furry little friends curled up together, taking a nap under the shade of a tree, maybe with a peaceful little stream on the other side of the tree.


Long story.... medium, my puppy, Taco, was a toy rat terrior, and was 11 years old when we met our cat, Odie. Odie was pretty old too (we later found out he was 12), and when he first came up to us, he was starved and beaten up. We nursed him back to full health, and the two old guys became friends. About 4 months later, Taco passed away, having given us more happiness than we deserved. Odie stuck around (he was an outdoor cat), and was a great, loving little friend. Two days ago, a neighbor had let his aggressive dog out to roam the streets (illegal where I love), and it killed my little Odie cat. It still hurts my heart a lot, but I try to imagine that Taco was there waiting for Odie cat when he passed over, the two friends reunited, healthy and young.


So, if anyone feels up to, could someone could draw my two furry little friends under the shade of a tree, maybe with a peaceful little stream on the other side of the tree, curled up together and taking a nap while they wait to be reunited with their buddy drewsephvladmir?

Problem is that it is a ticketless event and I want to give him something for his birthday in August to let him know we are going. Can someone draw an announcement/ticket for the show so that I can surprise him with it on his birthday?? You would have my unending gratitude. If it could include Eddie and something Megadeth related, that would be even better. Thanks.	t5_2sqsz	True

1364275670.0	1b0yfx	[request] need someone that likes to draw D&amp;D characters	ObliviusMaximus	14	3	7	"So I'm actually very new to DnD but  i created this character that i think is bad ass and I'd like and nice picture to go  with him. His name is the same as mine (ObliviusMaximus) and he's a Goliath Warlock (Hexblade). The back story that i wrote for him may help with the design. Late one night many years ago, a child, ObliviusMaximus (or Max for short) was awaken from a deep slumber. He awoke to a man in robes at the foot of his bed. This man explained to Max that he had been chosen to become the living embodiment of the dark lord Asmodeous. The man explained that he was part of a cult that worshipped the dark lord and that he could teach Max the ways of the dark arcane magic. Max agreed to leave with him and train. Over the years, Max had become quite adept with the dark magic and the Blade of Annihilation but with each passing day, he began to resent the cult and everything they stood for. Late one night, Max slaughtered the members of the cult leaving only one to survive. A female human warlock name Ophilia (my companion character) who vowed to follow Max and help him in any way she could. 

Ok that was longer than i remember but hopefully it helps. So far my only equipment is chainmail armor, the Blade of Annihilation and some bags. I'd like to see a Joker and Harley Quinn style picture of Max and Ophilia if possible. Max it's 7 foot 8 with a Mohawk (down) and Ophilia is an average size human female with long red hair.... And busty hahaha. Hopefully someone decides to do this and thanks in advance!"	t5_2sqsz	True

1) Her Pathfinder character, a Red Panda Paladin (aka Pandadin) that wears chainmail and uses an oversized, two-handed maulaxe.  Also has a Brass Dragon cohort, but even without the dragon I'd be plenty happy.
2) A ""Tron-ified"" Red Panda.  I've not got much specific in mind on this one, she likes Tron almost as much as red pandas, so the combination should result in exponential happiness increases.

I've had a great visual idea of my character, but I lack the skills to get him on paper, so here's my description of my character, Executus Charborn:

Executus Charborn stands at 6'2"" and 130 lbs. At 16, he was transformed from a human into a humanoid fire elemental by a mysterious magical artifact. His skin is mostly a light tone, but dried and charred by his elemental transformation. He is now 27 years old and served as a mercenary for several houses in the Last War. Roaring flames replace his formerly human hair, and small flames flicker from the corners of his deep black eyes. His face has an alien, elemental look to it, changed by the transformation. Executus wears a long, plain, flowing robe with hems charred from the blistering heat of his fiery form. In one had he wields a thick charred oak staff while the other hand conjures a small fireball as if charging an infernal spell.

We came up with the idea to have us all be dinosaurs (or just have the feet, to make a play on all those shoe announcement pictures). There's my boyfriend, myself, my 4 yr old son and the unborn. For the baby, instead of a dino/feet, it would be a dino egg.

And we were going to add to the bottom, ""Life finds a way"". To, of course make a Jurassic Park reference, because how could you not.

My friend Austin and I were playing a game called Wizardry Online, well i had been playing for a bit and was stuck in a dungeon. So I enlisted my friend Austin to give me a hand. (He showed me the game to begin with.) So we start blazing through the dungeon and we get almost to the middle when an elf woman and knome (the female version of a dwarf basically but with ram horns.) pop up in the same dungeon. They are higher levels and just helping out other players, until they meet Austin. They stop and start talking while I'm busy trying to get a little further. I wind up being attacked by 3 highway men and a lumberjack. (a big burly semi shirtless mob that carries and axe and spartan kicks you to deal damage) So while I'm essentially being mugged and murdered. My friend is busy flirting with a couple girls.

While listening to this song, she described to me in vivid detail these visions that this song was giving to her that really sound quite beautiful, and I'd like to see if someone could make this into a work of art. My expectations are low, but it sounded intriguing to me, so I thought others might find it evocative as well. I describe the vision below in the same stream of consciousness that it was told to me:

* Time-travelling pirates.
* Flying through space on a pirate ship, but its a space ship that looks like a pirate ship.
* Space whales (if you do choose to draw this, maybe choose a whale other than Orca whales. My wife has some sort of strange fear of them based on Free Willy. I don't get it either.) flying, following these pirates.
* Pirates are not hunting the whales, but just travelling with them.
* Whales are colorful, a muted version of Lisa Frank, perhaps (her words, not mine).

Maybe there is a way to turn this into something beautiful. If someone is really passionate about this (not my expectation, but if), and the image is good, I may frame it for her as a gift for her birthday or Christmas. Otherwise, I just think it would be a beautiful surprise, since I doubt she will even remember this whole incident after today.

But each mirror gets bigger, there's more opportunity, a small history behind you but as you move forward in your life, your past opportunity was larger (a larger mirror) than the one before that, and you'll see yourself in a mirror one day at the end of this path (not death, but a person you've become).  And while I was walking down this path and I'd look in each mirror I'd wonder when it's time to move to a larger mirror, with more opportunity, and more ambition.

Name: Lord Vladimir Chang of Scotland

Race: Half Elf

Class: Fighter

Alliance: Chaotic Neutral

Back Story: Raised as royalty in Scotland by a Russian mother and a Chinese Father, Vlad was forced into the family trade of bag-piping. Being embarrassed, Vlad fled from home and got addicted to drugs. Found on the streets of Scotland, starving and poor, a passing war lord took him in. Little did Vlad know, his new owner planned on training and fighting Vlad in underground hand to hand fighting to the death. Devoting himself to his new trade, Vlad mastered hand to hand combat, gaining respect and fame to those who know the deadly sport. Vlad had enough of being his owners play toy, he managed to break free from his cell, kill his owner and run away from his own personal hell. Vlad now wanders the roads of the world in search of meaning in his life.

The image/feeling is of a guy (slender with short hair if it matters), with some kind of rope attached to his chest. Not to the heart, but more of the dead center of the upper chest. The rope is long enough to reach the ground if he's standing up, but it passes through everything, so it's always weighing down. On the other end of the rope is something like a sack of bricks, a bowling ball, or a large metal ball of ball-and-chain description (not an anchor, though). The pose doesn't really matter, but maybe something like sitting against a wall.

I am looking to have different artists for each of my Mythical Monsters tea blends! I want to showcase many different artists rather than just doing the art myself. I think this will add a lot of character and an interesting twist to this tea collection!

The current blends are listed here:

https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/group.html?group=1289

If you are interested in drawing the art for any of these blends, please comment with which creatures you would like to draw (or send me an ask on tumblr, http://taelithium.tumblr.com/ask). Please choose at least 3 creatures you would be interested in drawing just in case your top choice gets chosen by someone else before I get a chance to see your message.

The art must be 700x437 pixels, preferably in PNG format. It should have the creature’s name large and visible as well as your name (you deserve credit for this!!). Whether or not you include the teas in the blend on the actual label is completely up to you. (Don't worry about whether your art is traditional or drawn on the computer! If you draw it on paper, feel free to scan it and send it to me!)

And once all the teas are done, I may just feel nice enough to send you a bag of the blend with your art on it so you can show it off!!!! :D
Make sure you add me as a friend and let me know which tea you drew so I know who to give gifts to!

CREATURES THAT ARE BEING DRAWN:

Siren

Mermaid

Faun

Send all finished art to necromanticize@gmx.com
OR- if you prefer, upload it to an image sharing site (like tinypic) and direct message me the link.

My Name:
Jack Watts

Blurb:
He walks the earth, leaving a trail of corpses in his wake. He has no mercy on those who do not deserve it. He can never be caught and can disappear in the blink of an eye. Only one thing is known for certain. He came from the sky.

My Thoughts On The Cover:
I was thinking I want the main focus to be a silhouette of the man. I had the idea of the man leaning against the edge of the book, holding a cane (a straight stick not a walking stick). And then cobbles as the ground that slowly fade away?

Any constructive advice/criticism/designs/artwork would be greatly appreciated.

1352792333.0	13434a	[REQUEST] Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Wilford Woodruff smoking pipes; Mt Rushmore style! (they're old Mormon prophets who smoked)	Bobstbob	19	10	11	"So I'm an Exmo (former member of the LDS or Mormon church) and while browsing [r/exmo](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/) there was a fellow Exmo who was being shunned in Provo, UT just because he was going out for a smoke by his car every so often. I came up with the idea that he should make a sweet smoking jacket and another redditor came up with the drawing idea from the title.

The reason we love this idea for an image (to go on his sweet smoking jacket) is because those four men, who were the first four presidents and prophets for the Mormon church all happened to smoke. (back in the day it wasn't against the rules to do so.) The Church tries to hush up anyone talking about any of their old prophets doing things like drinking or smoking that would come across as questionable or against the standards which they practice today. So the smoking jacket would be a good gift from the Exmo community for this poor fellow (because we like to try and help each other out a lot on Exmo), it brings up great questions from stereotypical mormons about it, and in general it would kind of be a bad ass shirt or jacket!

TL;DR A guy in provo is being shunned because he smokes. Design is for a smoking jacket for him and to make shirts for stereotypical ex-mormons to wear (because it would be kick ass!).

PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN AND DON'T MIND! Also if you would be interested in compensation I would probably be open to it, just PM me.

Since my last trip home, I have a new pet rabbit, and so are having to make some accommodations to provide for her at my parent's home. My parents are excited to be able to provide her with a ""chew toy"" of deer antler.

Growing up, whenever we referred to eating rabbit or venison we fondly call them Thumper and Bambi respectively.

Hence the idea for the image was born. Nothing too fancy necessary, just thought that someone might enjoy drawing the cute woodland creatures in a somewhat grotesque scene where a blood-stained Thumper is eating Bambi's corpse.

I am one of the moderators of this subreddit. ICanDrawThat was created by tptbrg95 because I posted an IAMA regarding a subreddit for people to draw things. Thanks tptbrg95 for start this, I hope it can gain some attention as time passes.

As the title says, I thought it would be appropriate if one of members of ICanDrawThat drew the header. I uploaded a basic drawing to test out the processes (I'm new to the moderator tools).

I'll take a look at anything but it has to be 120x40 px and a png file. I'm not sure how i'll pick a winner, but that can come latter. i'll likely go by the upvote count as long as it isn't distasteful and is a good representation of ICanDrawThat.

I guess the only thing I wouldn't do, is copy the movie scene version of what happened in the book. Just put down what you saw in your own imagination, and have fun with it.

1364946345.0	1bjv2s	[REQUEST] Comic Concept Art	erock0607	19	11	13	"Hey guys, I'm writing a comic [for a highschool creative writing assignment], and would like a piece of concept art to go along with my initial story pitch [showing the first draft to my teacher, she's a major Watchmen fan so I think she'd think it's snazzy:D].  What I'm looking for is a black and white piece of a kid suspended and drowning in black sludge-like water. This is the main character, Malcolm, when he gets shwasted and he and his friends break into a piece of radioactive land closed off to the public and they drunkenly toss him into the lake in the middle of it, in which he drowns and gains his powers. Black and white art is cool, but if you need this detail for shading Malcolm has brown regular-guy short cut hair. Thank you in advance!

clarification: Misunderstanding guys, I'm just doing it for a highschool class and we have to show the story to the teacher (it's a friday class creative writing thing we do) and I wanted to throw some pictures in there since it's just the text for the story that I have.

I'll be sure to put your name or username on it)	ILoveYosemite	8	0	0	"I'm an unskilled college student working on a campaign to get bottled water out of Yosemite national park. The goal is to disrupt coke and pepsi and other corps' attempts to privatize water, and to remove waste from our national parks.

I have this idea: Have a faucet with a man standing under it and the tap water pouring directly into his open mouth, and next to this a progression with another faucet pouring into a plastic bottle, then a truck carrying bottled water to Yosemite, and at the entrance to Yosemite is a concession stand selling the bottled water. 

Bottled water corporations are using our national parks as concession stands for a product that is a human right and should be democratically controlled!

BlitheCynic	8	0	0	"I was on a beach that was utterly vast, stretching to the horizon in three directions. On the more inland part of the beach, there was a huge stretch of tidepools on a slope. They seemed to be made of lava or something, but each consisted of a ridge about five feet across holding shallow water, and they were just stacked on each other all the way up the slope. There was a large black cloud hanging over the tide pools, casting enough of a shadow that you could see the phosphorescent plankton in them glowing.
However, the cloud ended right at the end of the tidepools and the ocean and the strip of white sand between the ocean and the pools was soaked in bright yellow light from a clear afternoon sky. The water was bright blue and the waves were massive, but somehow benevolent. I knew it would be possible at any time for one of them to engulf the entire beach where I was sitting and wash me out to sea."	t5_2sqsz	True
