----

**UPDATE ON LOCATION**

Anyone showing up at the park around 2pm, a few of us will be meeting at the **south gates** near Queen and Strachen. We'll be heading in to secure a location once we have a small group gathered.

I'll have [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/28MWl.jpg) (courtesy of kikikills) mounted to the back of my bike, so keep an eye out! Or private message me for a cell number!

----

Based on feedback we've split the meetup into two parts. As with most other meetups feel free to come and go as you please. If we have anything in particular scheduled (e.g. group photos) we can discuss the timing of those below. Same goes for any questions/comments/angry rants.

**[Trinity Bellwoods Park](https://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=trinity+bellwoods+park,+toronto&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=trinity+bellwoods+park,&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON&amp;cid=0,0,286861246592677307&amp;ei=nnTeT4i9L_H16gHa9eCcCw&amp;ved=0CA0Q_BIwAw), 2pm-7pm**

For those who want something all-ages-friendly a bunch of us will be meeting in [Trinity Bellwoods Park](https://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=trinity+bellwoods+park,+toronto&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=trinity+bellwoods+park,&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON&amp;cid=0,0,286861246592677307&amp;ei=nnTeT4i9L_H16gHa9eCcCw&amp;ved=0CA0Q_BIwAw) starting around 2 pm and continuing on until around 7pm. Location will depend on where free space is available, but we'll be bringing signs. I'll also update our location in this post the day off, and can provide my cell number to those concerned about finding us.

This is a chance for people of all ages to get their park on. Bring frisbees, footballs, acoustic guitars, dogs, slacklines, board games, picnic baskets, what have you. If you have any particular outdoor activities you'd like to partake of feel free to post them!

For those looking to get their drink on, we have a reservation for up to a hundred at [Betty's](https://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=betty's+toronto&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=betty's&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON&amp;cid=0,0,12874795147432763926&amp;ei=nnXeT-nSF63M6QH-s8iCCw&amp;ved=0CBMQ_BIwAA) starting at 7 pm.

Their food isn't anything to write home about, but they have a fairly large drink selection and are big enough that we should be able to spill over into the rest of the bar if we happen to hit capacity.

(Thanks to eronanke for handing our reservation!)

**Getting between Trinity Bellwoods and Betty's**

For those taking public transit, you can take the Queen streetcar east from the park til Sherbourne, then walk down to King from there. Total trip is about 20-25 minutes.

For those driving, Dundas is a bit faster heading east, then south on University and east on King.

For those walking or biking, head straight down Niagara or Strachan to King and east from there."	t5_2s0wq	True

Hey everyone,

The [third annual global meetup day](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/szxfj/the_3rd_annual_global_reddit_meetup_day_is_on/) was just announced, so I thought it might be appropriate to start a discussion post for anyone wanting to put forth ideas. Plus it's something to link too off the meetup's corresponding [Reddit Gifts page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/toronto-global-meetup/).

Any ideas regarding venues? Format? Activities? Special things you'd like to do for the global that we don't normally do at the monthlies?"	t5_2s0wq	True

The [Global reddit Meetup Day](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html)
was announced not that long ago, and you had best believe that Toronto will be represented!

***Part One***

To start off we will again be in Trinity Bellwoods Park
([840 Queen Street West](http://goo.gl/maps/LkCez)).
We will meet at 2pm by the south gates on Queen Street and move shortly thereafter into the park (location updates will be available on the day, probably referencing
[that grid map](http://torontoist.com/2011/06/clever_trinity-bellwoods_map_helps_friends_get_together/)).

**All ages are welcome!**
Bring a friend or family member.
Bring a frisbee or a ball.
Bring a dog or two.
Everything is possible!
^(City bylaw and international treaty permitting, of course.)

And as per standard procedure, we'll be heading to a nearby bar afterwards for some drinks, which leads me to:

***Part Two***

Starting at 7pm, and carrying onwards until last call, we have a reservation at The Office Pub
([117 John Street](http://goo.gl/maps/v9hzu)) (http://www.theofficepub.ca/).
We will have the use of their third floor which should be plenty of room for everyone.
It's moderately priced with a good selection and happens to be a popular destination for redditors after movie meetups.  
**This *is* a 19+ venue.** (Sorry, [bostonpancakes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1ese4j/planning_global_meetup_saturday_june_15th/ca3eg2a). Maybe next year?)



&gt; Please don't feel obligated to show up at the start or stay right to the end!
&gt; Even if you just stop by to say hello, we'd love to see you all the same.  
&gt; If you've never been out to a meetup before, it's nothing to worry about.
&gt; This is a great opportunity to meet a bunch of super-friendly folks in a laid-back, relaxed setting.

For the Facebookers among us, event pages have been created.
Please share and invite anyone you think might like to join us for either
[Part One](https://www.facebook.com/events/343119622481477/) or

You get $20 per person plus free drinks and snacks while watching videos (Netflix) or playing a game in a simulated living room for an hour. We are now recruiting participants in groups of 4, where everyone knows everyone else.

Times are very flexible.

If you want to participate, please send an email to this address :
dustin@cs.toronto.edu

EDIT:
FAQs

1) Age restrictions: 18+ This is because of a restriction in our university study protocol. Sorry

2) ""Can I come by myself?"" No, sorry. The study requires groups of 4 people that **know each other**. You'll, er, need to get some friends.

3) ""What's the catch?"" We'll be recording your data. For Science. More details in correspondence.

EDIT 2: 
Thanks for all the responses, sorting through them while doing study logistics. Soooo many pages of emails.
Also, how is this the 4th-most upvoted event in Toronto of all time? This is fake fun. Toronto needs to have more real fun.

1342998758.0	wzjc0	An appeal for a more social Toronto subreddit. 	Jenicyd	39	4	17	"Lately there have been a lot of ""bored, let's hang out"", ""looking for friends"" or ""new to the city"" type posts. They seem to be popular among people, and why not? Making new friends is fun and exciting. Now r/Torontevents has always been a ""here is a time and place if you'd like to come"" subreddit, and that is awesome too. Sometimes people would like something more concrete, and this gives them a nice little rundown if anything is planned.

In a previous thread addressing the issue, the moderating team suggested the possibility of creating an /r/TorontoSocial subreddit. I would like to take them up on their offer, and am asking for suggestions of how we would like that subreddit to look.

Here are some of my ideas:

Tags are a must I think. It makes for easier filtering, and helps people see clearly what they are looking for. Some examples could be [Event] for something like a charity walk or a concert, [Meetup] for a group already going out looking for more, [R4R] for more personal/intimate get togethers (platonic or romantic). I'm sure there are a few more that could be used, but I also suggest keeping it simple. 

A mega thread with info about moving to Toronto! It can be really confusing to move to a new city, and a post explaining all of the information that is repeated every time could be really helpful. 

A mega thread of regular /r/TorontoSocial users? This might be a tad ambitious, but a place to introduce yourself, share maybe your twitter or facebook profile, or say what part of town you're from could help. I would suggest any replies that are not in the specific format, or are just conversational in nature be removed to keep it neat, no children replies. I didn't say they were all good ideas.

An integrated calendar of properly scheduled events. I think I stole this idea from Dobs, but it's a good one. I know it's a lot of fun to say ""I'm going drinking here this weekend, someone come"" but what most people don't realize is that the organizers of events take the time to make sure a significant number of people are attending before they post anything. They put a lot of effort into making their events successful, including reservations, research, and spreading the word before it even makes it here. So officially recognized events on a calendar would be fantastic. 

I am sure there are hundreds of ideas, so let's throw them out there and see what we can make sense of and work with. Then it's just a matter of making the move."	t5_2s0wq	True

Splitting into park/bar was a great idea, giving something to suit everyone.

----

This upcoming April the 13th, we will celebrate the birth of Guy Fawkes. As one of the early innovators to the steam engine, his contributions to the locomotive industry are second to none (well, maybe to György Lukács but the jury's still out on that one).

Steam originated in India and was carried to China in the 14th century. From there, it represented West Virginia in the US House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913, where it was one of the authors of the Clayton Act. It wasn't until the late 1900s that the engine met steam and was used as a folk medicine in Togo to treat gastrointestinal diseases.

Reddit Monthlies are a lot of fun and you should definitely come join us for the night. We're a bunch of generally friendly people from the internet looking to enjoy some delicious food, drink, conversation and tunes. 

If you've never been to a monthly before, we take the entire second floor of the Artful Dodger. I hope there is no dragon attack this month.

1340032501.0	v8688	[META] Regarding /r/trees meetups: A humble request from a fellow ent	femanonent	49	16	59	"Hey ents, I'd like to bring up a topic which is difficult for me to discuss. I've been attending the /r/trees meetups frequently, and there's something that doesn't sit right with me. Now, you might ask, why not just bring it up when everybody is there at the meetup? 

I have several reasons for this post, which I will outline in this next paragraph, but if you don't really care, feel free to skip this one. At the meetups, everybody is stoned. People might not hear me, might not be listening, or even might be too far gone to care. Additionally, this topic is pretty personal, and I fear I would open myself to even more problematic remarks if I brought this up in person. Also, of course, at the meetups I'm stoned as well, and by the time I've heard the offending material and processed the flood of emotion, the moment is gone, the conversation has moved on.

My main point is this: the amount of rape jokes at these meetups is too damn high. I am a victim of sexual assault, and these jokes sour my experience and ruin my high in an instant. I know it's ""all in good fun"" for some of you, but for me, it is a reminder of the worst experience in my life. I do not choose to be offended, it affects me at a gut level. I would imagine I'm not alone, either. It's a reality that many women, as well as men, are victims of rape and other forms of sexual assault. A common sentiment is that we'd like to see more women at the meetups, but if we don't make this a woman-friendly space, how can we expect that to happen?

I'm not trying to police you, censor you, or take away your free speech. I want everybody to enjoy the meetups, but that also includes me, and possibly others who may be too timid to speak up. I'm just asking you all, ent to ent, person to person, friend to friend - let's be good to each other, just because we can. 

I don't want to stop attending the meetups, but I've heard these jokes at the vast majority of meetups I've been to, I would almost even say every single one. I've never felt unwelcome at the meetups, and people seem to enjoy my contributions, but if this continues, I don't think I would be able to handle it.

NOTE: I asked the mods about this beforehand, and they've been incredibly supportive. I hope we can keep this discussion civil. Edited for syntax and clarity."	t5_2s0wq	True

Yes there is! The deal is, we get enough people to RSVP, then I can book a group, and we can get group discounts! SWEET! RSVP is handled by:

&gt; It's Mel Lastman's birthday this upcoming Saturday and I feel it would be a great disservice to the former mayor, and current bad boy if we didn't celebrate along with him. 
&gt;
&gt; So yeah, this is as good a time as any to remember all that he did for our great city. For one, he was courageous enough to call in the army during the blizzard of 1999. He brought World Youth Day to the city and pushed the Sheppard line. He was a bit ridiculous.

&gt;	Dear Artful Dodger,

&gt;It is with much enthusiasm that we are writing you in attempts to secure another Saturday night at your beautiful venue. As a group, we have been inside you many times before and are eager for another shot.

&gt;Why us? Firstly, we are the Toronto branch of Reddit, an organization dedicated to promoting kitty cats and internet freedom. We are capable of pulling in upwards of 100 people to your second floor and have a tendency to drink a lot. So that's that's good for business. Some don't drink much but they may eat. That's good for business too. 

&gt;As a group, we have several centuries worth of drinking experience as you can surely see in the attached resume. But that's not the main goal of our attending the event. We hope to be social and talk about all things Reddit, about all things Toronto, about all things whatever, whatever.

&gt;We're a good group of mostly well behaved short-time strangers from the internet. Yes, that internet.

&gt;Please consider this application and we hope to hear back shortly.

It's that time of the month again (no, not that one). **REDDIT MONTHLY MEETUP TIME!** 

The event begins at **6pm at the Artful Dodger**, which is near Yonge and Bloor just south on Isabella. [Proper map can be found here](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=artful+dodger+toronto&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=49.891235,-97.15369&amp;sspn=30.854033,86.572266&amp;hq=artful+dodger+toronto&amp;t=m&amp;z=15). We have the top floor to ourselves, so just head on up. There are always people who stick around until the bar closes, so feel free to show up whenever!

The answer is: socialize and drink (or not drink if you're not down with that, not everyone is), 19+ (this is a bar, sorry guys), and yes (don't be weird about it). How do you find us? Just walk upstairs! Be bold! Ask someone 'Hey, is this the Reddit meetup?' Even though you totally know it is. It's cool, we've all been there. If you are super totally worried about not knowing anyone, feel free to message me for my number and we can be friends. It's that simple.

This upcoming Saturday marks the perfect chance to ring in the new year oppan Reddit style. And if your New Year's resolution is anything like mine (to party more) then you've found the right place. 


So go ahead, turn over that new leaf you've always wanted to turn. If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one. Every wall is a door. Fall seven times, stand up eight. Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another. The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. Courage is the power to let go of the familiar. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. My Mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can move on. [Magic legs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKFKRuWwgjg).


For anyone that's never been to one of these before, we take the entire second floor of the Artful Dodger. There's food, drink, pool, darts and a varied crowd of mostly happy Redditors. 


Joining a room of internet strangers may seem like a daunting undertaking for some, but I stress that we're a welcoming bunch. And remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life!

Looking back at some of these meetup write-ups, I realize how many times it's been mentioned that any given meetup will be the best ever. Looking forward to this month's edition, I can only apologize to past attendees for making these false claims.


You see, this upcoming meetup is going to be the best ever. There's no doubt about it. And because of this certainty, any prior declaration of the sort can only be described as being false. While I never meant to deceive anyone with those words, the fact of the matter is that I was wrong. Honest mistake I guess.


This meetup is going to be the best ever Reddit Meetup in the history of Reddit Meetups. What sets this one apart from the rest you may ask? 


Here, I wrote some reasons on a napkin while surfing down some sand dunes the other day:


* Now's your chance to be decked out in some holiday flair. Suggestions include a santa hat, that snowman shirt, those snowflake ear rings you never wear, or just your regular clothes, something something something.
* People will be finishing exams and looking for a great night out!
* It hasn't happened yet.
* [Space madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZCiZpph9jo)
* milk
* tomato sauce
* green and red peppers
* canned tuna


So come one come all to the most amazing Reddit Meetup of all time. We take the entire second floor of the Artful Dodger. There's a pool table, dedicated staff, a dart board and loads of interesting people having a good time.

1346857803.0	ze9b7	Monthly Reddit Meetup: Silly Hats Only Party	dreman	37	8	51	"**Pretty much copied from the [/r/toronto Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/361626814573/) invite:**

A request was made. It was for a ""Silly Hats Only"" meetup. Looking back, a Lite meet with this theme happened just a few weeks ago but someone messaged me asking to get one underway for the monthly. 

So, to satisfy these glorious ambitions of of this fellow, I shall promote this event as the ""Silly Hats Only"" meetup. 

But before I go any further, let me tell you my history with silly hats. Be warned, it isn't very interesting. But my fingers are typing and that can't very well be stopped now can it?

I remember watching Don Hertzfeldt's Rejected many many years ago. The thunderous laughter that poured out from me was pure and unfiltered. I was amused to put things bluntly. Yes, bluntly. 

There was that scene, the Silly Hats Only beating scene. [Yes, there was that scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEiyBbP28g8). 

Fast forward a few years and I was out on the back porch with my thoughts before realizing the neighbours were having a Silly Hats Party. They were older than me. Somewhere in their thirties and I thought, ""so, this is what people in their thirties do."" It was night but the moon was full and it was fall. It was nice out.

Let's pass through time some more to the moment I decide on having my own Silly Hats Only Party. It was fun. The place I was living in at the time's kitchen was being renovated but the party was a success nonetheless. I wore a cheap plastic viking hat I bought during my visit to Iceland not long before. Though, it could very well have been purchased at any costume shop in our fine city.

There you go. Silly hat parties aren't exclusively for people in their thirties. My initial thought was flawed. But that's okay, as secondary, tertiary and so forth thoughts are often necessary before anything good develops anyway.

Now here I am, fresh into thirty when this Jonathan fellow messages me with the request. A Silly Hats Only request. Or maybe it was just a hats request. 

In any case, let's do this shall we? 

**If you've never been to a Reddit Monthly Meetup before. We meet on the second floor of the Artful Dodger and take our time to enjoy drinks, food, pool, darts and each other in a less awkward way than you might imagine. There are many regulars and many new attendees every month.**

**It's all a lot of fun and whether you're new to the city or born and raised here, you have to come out. Do not be afraid. We are a friendly, cheerful bunch.**

**Oh yes, and silly hats are not mandatory. You will not be treated like in the Don Hertzfeldt clip if you don't have one on. But hey, you know.**

1370225437.0	1fk040	Dance Night + Game Elements = Ridiculous, Unusual Party? (Interest Gauging Thread)	sovietmoustache	34	3	11	"Howdy folks!

First off, I just want to extend my thanks to everyone in the /r/torontoevents community. If you recognize my username (or you quickly skim through my history), then you'll know that I love creating events and, furthermore, that you crazy kids have offered some wonderful support all along the way. I'd like to think it's a mutually beneficial relationship - I get to turn my weirdo ideas into reality and you have more options for your Friday/Sunday/Wednesday/Whenever.

For a long while, I've had it in my mind that I would like to organize a dance party that incorporates some competitive game elements - but it's an admittedly strange concept that isn't as easy to market as, say, an Arrested Development trivia night. That's why I'm bringing it up here first, to see if there's any interest and refine the idea a little before I make any concrete plans.

How the evening would work...

1) When attendees first arrive, they're randomly sorted into 1 of 4 (or 5 or 6) colour-coded teams for the night.

2) Every 10 - 20 minutes or so, a member from each team is called to the front stage to participate in some ridiculous mini-game (lightning-round trivia, extreme rock-paper-scissors, embarrassing feats of strength) to win points for their entire group and/or some personal prize.

3) In the background, a couple more passive challenges occur throughout the evening. (E.g. ""What team can write the most clever sexually explicit haiku?"" - with a box to take submissions).

4) Just after midnight, champions are declared and the rest of the time is spent dancing and socializing - with the victors proclaiming their superiority loudly and the losers complaining about the victors even loudly-er.

I've always been excited about this idea because I love dance parties, and I think the best ones get people to socialize with strangers. In this case, you automatically have topics of discussion with your fellow attendees and immediate kinship/rivalries are formed with the existing teams. I'd like to think that the evening could be akin to a somewhat debaucherous, party version of the Hogwarts House Cup (""10 points to Gryffindor!)

Anyways, if you have some opinions on the matter, let me know what you think. What works? What doesn't? What would you like to see if I get this off the ground - and based on my history, I can ensure you that if I decide to go ahead with this idea, I *will* make it happen.

Cheers!"	t5_2s0wq	True

I can't change the title of this post to reflect the change, but I will make another annoucement in May once we get closer to the date.**

Hey, I know it's super early to post this, but I wanted to get the word out ASAP for a couple reasons...

1) To see how much interest there is (so I can get a handle on the logistics for the evening)

2) To get feedback and shape the event based on the suggestions I receive.

So anyways, yes: I'm organizing a big Arrested Development theme party for Friday, May 17th (@ the Office Pub). The new episodes are coming out on the 26th, and I figured this would be a great way to celebrate and be reminded of all things Bluth before jumping back into that world.

Current plans for the night include...

**Trivia Competition**
Prove your AD knowledge is *solid as a rock!*

**Costume Contest**
Prizes for Best and Most Obscure costumes!

**Classic Episodes**
[Vote online for your favourites](http://www.explodingzebra.com/bluthvote/) and we'll screen the top 3 episodes that evening.

NOTE: I'm also thinking of doing some **Group Karaoke** (think Afternoon Delight, Final Countdown, etc.) and bringing in a DJ for a **Late Night Dance Jam** after the other features have wrapped up. I'd love to hear feedback on whether there's any interest in these last 2 ideas.

There will be a $5 cover for the night, because I want to have a budget for decorations, prizes, the (possible) DJ, etc.

*Remember Remember the 10th of November.*

*It's not every month that we get to celebrate a monthly on the 10th of November. Truth be told, it's only possible once a year. But even that isn't something that usually happens due to the tradition of scheduling these on the second Saturday of every month.*

*The last time there was a 10th of November on a Saturday was in 2007. The next will be in 2018.*

*Think about how many glasses of water or pieces of chocolate you will eat between now and then. If my math is correct, we're talking trillions of glasses of water and pieces of chocolate for every Canadian between then and now. It's science.*

*Having this meetup on Saturday the 10th of November is something to be cherished and that's exactly what we're going to do.*

*As per routine, we're going to be celebrating our Redditness on the entire second floor at the Artful Dodger this coming Saturday. Drinks and food and friends and chatter. New attendees and a possible local celebrity in attendance.*

*This is going to be off the hook.*

*If you've never been to a Reddit meetup before, don't be afraid. We're all just out to have a good night in the city. New to the city? This is the perfect opportunity to meet new people. It's a win win win situation. That's one extra win for winning win win.*

I strongly believe that it is only through international efforts like this that we as a people are capable of reducing the occurrence of natural disasters on Earth.

The time to do our part is now!

Initially, a regular mix of Reddit powers was deemed sufficient to get the natural disaster reduction job done. These powers include hanging out at the [Artful Dodger](http://www.theartfuldodger.ca/) with a mix of high spirits and trending memes. 

But after some talk, it seems **the best way to reduce natural disasters is to dress up in costume.** The [council](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/10tkvc/next_meetup_thoughts_on_costumes/) has voted that this can be done at the degree of your choosing. 

There are those that will come decked out head to toe in full costume.

Some will put on a suit and say ""*hey, I'm Psy.*"" Gangnam Style.

Others even still will stand by their belief that the best way to reduce natural disasters is by dressing up in their regular garb. 
These are all acceptable forms of dress.

So yes, come as you choose and help us reduce natural disasters this upcoming Saturday night. As usual, we will be taking the entire second floor of the venue. A variety of drinks and food are available for consumption and it will be a blast! 

For those on the fence about coming out for the first time. We're just a bunch of folks looking for a fun night in the city. Whether you are new or old to Toronto, there is nothing to stress over. Worried you'll have nothing to talk about? Talk about the costume you or someone else is wearing... talk about natural disaster reduction... or even just about Reddit.

""And I'll get something going for us TorEnts,"" Canadianquestion buzzed, ""but I'll need your help eMaddeningCrowd."" He nodded excitedly.

""Can someone pass the salt?"" I spoke.

At this point everyone ate some turkey; and it was good.

So that's how things started around here folks. It didn't seem like an important imaginary conversation when it was happening but history has proven otherwise. These meetups are a pretty big deal after all!

Where: [The Artful Dodger, 12 Isabella St](http://www.theartfuldodger.ca)

For those who haven't attended previously, the meetups mostly involve drinking and socializing. Monthly meetups have been breaking 80 people for a few months now and quite a few of us will be around until past midnight. There's no obligation to show up right at 6 though there's a better chance of catching people sober.

Newcomers encouraged, lurkers included. If you have questions, ask them here or PM me.

Dobs Says
&gt;Briefly: We have the whole upstairs, two rooms, capacity for about 100, our own bartender, cash and carry (with tab on credit card as an option). Drink prices moderate but they do pitchers, have about a dozen beers. Access to fire escape for smoking, stairs licensed for carrying drinks if people want to go down to one of the two patios.

&gt;Our own pool table and dart board, $35 for a party platter of 50 wings… 



For those who can't make the monthly buy still want to meet up with other Redditors, I highly recommend [/r/TorontoEvents](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/) and the [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/361626814573/).

Order, order in the court. We'll be hitting up the Rhino again and it'll be better than ever. And I mean it this time. 

If you're on the fence about coming out, don't be. A good time is always had. We basically mingle and eat and drink all night long. Hilarity always ensues. Don't let anxiety or your /r/firstworldproblems get in the way. Reddit in for real is just like scrolling down on the website forever always. Only different.

Guest Appearances:
- The Toronto Symphony Orchestra has agreed to perform a number from the Dolly Parton collection. Robot Kenny Rogers is rumoured to be in town and may play a ditty along side of them. Here's hoping kids!
- Two words, Elmer the Safety Elephant!

There was a brief moment in human history when there was no such thing as the internet. During this period, there was no Reddit either. Sure, there was the [unincorporated community of Redditt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redditt) in north Ontario, but that's not what Neal Young was singing about in [that song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JTy-GCfmvw). 

The town Neal Young sang about only makes sense when you consider the fourteen years after humanity walked out of the [primordial soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPiOoDeffU) and and found the internet. Reddit was discovered two years on when Mr. Mix and Genevieve Lamp happened across the lyrics ""and in my mind, I still need a place to go, all my changes were there."" 

With the birth of Reddit now behind bars, the Artful Dodger sprang up out of the ashes and became the beacon of hope for all those without tickets to the Moxy Früvous concert.

It wasn't easy at first, but after a few staplers worth of toner and perplexed readings of Ayn Rand, people started wondering about the second floor.

Why is it that the second floor of the Artful Dodger always fills up so nicely with random internet people on the second Saturday of every month? Why is it that these people have so much fun with chatter and drink and food on hot summer nights? It's a matter for science I'm sure, but at some point, we will go back to selling moon pies. All of us.

Last year, [dobs](/u/dobs) led the organisation of a two-parter, first at Trinity-Bellwoods Park and then Betty's on King.
Historically relevant posts are:

[""Reddit global meetup was awesome! Will definitely attend again.""](http://redd.it/vieu5).

Suggestions and ideas are needed!

Should we simply try to repeat last year's venues?
(I was unable to attend last year, but by all accounts I've seen and heard it was a popular success.)
I fear our options must surely be evaporating as time relentlessly marches forward.

This month, instead of celebrating the heroics of [Idefix](https://www.google.ca/search?q=idefix&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enCA519CA519&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=bLaKUdaqM-m4yAHVnYB4&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1061&amp;sei=braKUeHgMoa9ygGb34CAAQ) like we usually do, I propose we pay tribute to a much more local milestone. 

On May 11th, 1968, the Toronto Transit Commission opened its largest ever east-west Subway expansion to the public. Main, Victoria Park, Wardan in the east and High Park, Runnymede, Jane, Old Mill, Royal York, Islington in the west all started taking riders on that day. 

This is important for a number of reasons. I will detail one here. Ok, so, if you lived on Main St. and wanted to go to High Park prior to this date, it would have been more difficult to do so without access to an automobile. That might be a bit abstract for some. A real world example has Sally Broome (fake name used due to privacy concerns) wanting to go from Jane St. to Wardan Ave prior to this date. Again, It would be more difficult to do so without a subway. 

So yeah, let us gather this upcoming Saturday and celebrate the expansion with drinks, food, good people and good times! We'll be up the stairs on the second floor of the Artful Dodger. There are darts, a pool table and television screens. There is a table with a lot of table friends and a floor to stand on so we don't fall back down through to the first. Studies show that 83% of all attendees have more fun on meetup nights than they do on non-meetup nights. Fact.

&gt;Another month, another Reddit Monthly in Toronto.
I sometimes wonder what these monthlies would be like without the internet. I envision something along these lines:

&gt;[At the Dodger]

&gt;Redditor 1: Hey how's it going?

&gt;Redditor 2: Who are you? Get away from me! 

&gt;[Redditor 1 slinks away]

&gt;So it's good that we have the internet, that we have Reddit.

&gt;Don't be afraid if you've never been to one of these before. It's just a bunch of people out looking to have a good time. No slinking necessary. 

&gt;We'll be on the second floor in both rooms (all four rooms if you count the washrooms).

The address is 10 Isabella street, if you're going by the TTC it's right near the Yonge and Bloor station if you walk south from there. Here is a [map to give you a better idea](http://bit.ly/IxVBvX). It's the upstairs of the Artful Dodger. There's two rooms to the upstairs and we occupy both of them. 

For anyone who hasn't been to one of these before, don't be worried! It's super fun and everyone is incredibly friendly. If you have any questions or want an automatic new friend feel free to message me. "	t5_2s0wq	True

There will be at least eleven drinks consumed and probably eleven meals of food ordered. Eleven laughs and eleven smiles are sure to be in play. Eleven o'clock will come and go and eleven more pints will joyously flow. Eleven games of pool is not out of the question either!

So along with celebrating ourselves in our usual fashion, let us celebrate eleven as well.

Are they a gift from God, the devil? Do scientists use them when they throw sexy parties? Why do cats feel the need to pounce on them?

There are many mysteries when it comes to lasers, but one certainty: it is hella fun to run around an arena shooting each other with them!

Thus, the [interest thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1agwd4/laser_tag_gauging_interest_thread/) of more than a fortnight ago has developed into concrete plans...

**When:** Saturday, April 13 @ 3 PM

**Where:** [Laser Quest - Toronto East (1980 Eglinton Ave. E)](http://www.laserquest.com/public/locations/ON-Toronto%20East.cfm)

**Cost:** $ 8.50/game (I'm planning on 3 games, so think of $30 as the approx. investment)

**Duration:** Each game takes about 30 minutes (including preparation and play), so we'll be out there for about 2 hours.

The /r/torontoevents meetup will be that on that same day, so I figure this is a great opportunity to laser each other in the afternoon, before grabbing a drink together later that night.

*NOTE 1: I looked into discounts/group rates, but there were only a couple options available - 1) Doing a private booking, which is slightly cheaper if you can confirm around 30 attendees (which seems like an organizational hassle). 2) There were some dates where playing was cheaper, but this was the best date I could personally schedule that also fit the preference of the majority (see: a Saturday).

The monthly meetup consists of people drinking (or not) and socializing (or not). It's lots of fun! This will be my anniversary of coming to Reddit monthly meetups, and I've met lots of different awesome people over the past year. Before you ask: The age range really varies. I would say the average attendee is in their 20s, but we have younger and older people come out, and as long as you're happy to meet new people no one will care about your age. Yes, girls show up. No, no one will ask you that narwhal bacon question. Yes, we have regulars (because Toronto Reddit meetups are awesome), but we also get tons of new people. You will find us by going up the stairs at the Artful Dodger and asking the first person you see if this is the Reddit meetup. What if you're awkward? Feel free to send me a message and I will be your friend and introduce you to new people. We're a very friendly group!

Stop being so damn friendly!

But seriously, we've had a sudden surge of posts in /r/torontoevents by people looking to make friends. While we've seen some great meetup-related discussions (and even proposed meetups) come of those posts, the posts themselves aren't about meetups or events. Existing posts will be left as is, but future posts along these lines will be removed.

Alternatives:

  * Post your interest in making friends to /r/toronto or /r/r4rtoronto
  * Post a meetup to make friends at, or attend an already-planned meetup.

I'll add a note to the sidebar including a link to /r/r4rtoronto.

If there's sufficient demand we could also start up either /r/TorontoSocial or /r/TorontoSocialClub similar to what other cities have that attempts to consolidate both meetup and general social posts.

The [Feast of the Ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Ass) is medieval tradition celebrating the flight into Egypt.

I don't see how this is any different than Reddit. 

So this monthly, let's celebrate alongside our medieval brethren and pay tribute to The Feast of the Ass.

---


It was four years ago this month that Reddit user Annexchick [started a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/9537g/lets_try_it_again_torontogta_meetup_august_8ish/) in the then relatively new /r/toronto with the line: 


*""Let's try it again - Toronto/GTA Meetup, August 8ish??""*


There was discussion about where and when to meet and Dobs, the guy that was to wear a QR code shirt, offered to pay for those that were low on cash. The meetup took place at the Green Room then, and for several more to follow. 



In time, however, there was growth and a migration to the Rhino, located in the city's west end took place. There were periods when we were provided our own security and dedicated serving staff but our settlement was not complete until a more central location was decided on.



The Artful Dodger was selected and remains where the /r/toronto community gathers to this day. Whether through the large contingent of committed regulars or one-time attendees, hundreds of Torontonians and visitors alike have built up the courage, often while sitting in front of the comfortable glow of their computer screen, to make that nervous first trip.



Over the years, long lasting friendships formed, romantic relationships evolved and even a Reddit baby born. There have been nights of too much intoxication and countless conversations by an eclectic mix of folks with nothing else to tie them together but an internet website that focuses primarily on photos of cats.



Still going strong with no sign of letting up, come join us in this Saturday on the second floor of the Artful Dodger.

For those who haven't attended previously, the meetups mostly involve drinking and socializing. Monthly meetups have been breaking 80 people for a few months now and quite a few of us will be around until past midnight. There's no obligation to show up right at 6 though there's a better chance of catching people sober.

Newcomers encouraged, lurkers included. Our group normally ends up in the back-**left** corner so hopefully we'll be easy to spot. For any new people who're afraid that they may have trouble finding the group feel free to message me for a cell number.

Since it's been asked in the past, Rhino does both numbering for individual bills and cash-and-carry. Food is decent, beer is modestly priced, and with a fairly large selection.

For those who can't make the monthly buy still want to meet up with other Redditors, I highly recommend [/r/TorontoEvents](http://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoEvents) and the [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=361626814573)."	t5_2s0wq	True

Hi everyone!


I'm thinking that as we have a common love for food and beer, that we should head out to the Beer Bistro. This is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Toronto. 


Beer Bistro's claim to faim are:

* Fantastic beer selection
* Excellent food
* Well-known service


***Summary***

* **Date/Time:** November 7, 2012, 7:30PM
* **Location:** 18 King Street East
* **Type of Food:** Beer-Infused French/Belgium
* **Tipping:** Mandatory - I think it is default @ 15%-20%
* **Dress Code:** Casual (jeans + dress shirt/polo)
* **Avg Meal (with/without drink):** $25-$35/$40-$75
* **More Information:** [Beer Bistro's Website](http://www.beerbistro.com)

***Please note:*** this event is a trial run for /r/TOFoodie - a subreddit for those in the GTA to plan good food with good people. If you are interested in more events like this, please subscribe! Beer Bistro is probably the exception - future venues will not be as pricey as this one.


***Foodie Code of Conduct***

If anything comes of this group, I think it best to lay out the ground rules first. A lot of the venues will be or become our favourite venues, and I want to make sure that we will be welcomed again with open arms.

* **Dress Code:** Please be mindful of the venue. Some places require more formal attire than others. Dress code will always be stipulated in event info.
* **Tipping:** Fit to social norms (i.e. Boston Pizza Mandatory/Starbucks Optional). Assume yes if not otherwise stated. Standard tipping for Toronto restaurants is usually set at 15%.
* **Cash-and-Carry:** Settle your bills before you leave, including drinks, food, and tips."	t5_2s0wq	True

I will continue organizing these to happen in parks for as long as the weather holds up.  It's just so much better and less awkward than meeting at VC.  Plus it also allows our non-ent brethren to show up and enjoy themselves in typical meetup-lite fashion.


Unless there's a large vote against it, lets meet under a big tree on July 16 around 4pm at Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen near Ossington.  Obviously, this means the meeting area is massive, so we need a staging area for the first half hour while people show up.  The location we chose last time was less than ideal.  It would be great if some of you can volunteer some time to show up early with me to scope out a nice spot

Since we're doing this outdoors, non-ents are welcome to join in on this as long as you don't mind a bit of second hand smoke in the park  If you do mind, you can find another part of the circle to chill with if it gets offensive.

What to bring (Beyond the obvious)

* A blanket/towel/sheet to sit back on (optional)

* Frisbees, balls, and hackey sacks (duh)

* A ball or two

* A guitar or tam tam drum if you want to make some music

* Some snackage or beverages if you want to munch on stuff

If the weather sucks, we'll do the Vapor Central thing and meet there at 5pm.  I'll update this post the night before if there are changes

The tricky part of this meetup is that we don't really have a designated meeting spot. So here's what we do:

For those coming early, we'll meet at the gates of Trinity Bellwoods at 3:30 sharp. From there, we'll trek out into the park and look for a nice spot under the sun somewhere.
People that come late should look around the park for some balloons and a kite or two flying around.  If you have a smartphone, I'll try to get someone to post the exact GPS location on the thread as well when we get a spot.

I'll try to post exactly where we are once we get there."	t5_2s0wq	True

Thanks to a wonderful regular Toronto redditor who donated his credit card, I was able to book a park for June 25th from 10am-late. Unfortunately, High Park was fully booked, so we will be at Downsview Park, Area 1. Please bring any food/NON-ALCOHOLIC drinks/games/sex toys/etc. you wish to consume/play with.

The following is information regarding conditions of use at the park:

1.ZERO TOLERANCE ALCOHOL POLICY. I know, this sucks. On the bright side, those who feel like drinking after the picnic can head to any number of bars. This is the wonderful thing about Toronto.

2.PLEASE CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES. I'll stick around after to help clean up if you were not raised properly, but I'd like to enjoy myself too.

3.Tables, BBQs and parking cannot be guaranteed. I'll try to get there early enough to obtain a barbeque and some tables. If I do, only gas/propane BBQs are allowed. No charcoal.

4.No amplified music or microphones. No balloons, decorations or signage. (I'll put something up that indicates we are from the internet)

5.This is VERY IMPORTANT. Without the kindness of the redditor who donated his credit card, this wouldn't have been able to happen. There will be a collection tin for the cost ($83) of the permit. Please donate what you can!

I think that's it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If you are new and feel like you won't be able to find us, pm me and I'll send you my number.

HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!

Sound good? On the fence about it? Consider the following...

Laser Tag: ""The only place where it's socially acceptable to shoot screaming children in the back!""

So now that you're sold on the idea, a couple questions need answers.

1) Who is interested?
2) What days/dates would work best for you? (While I'm flexible for scheduling, I'm already thinking it might work well if we book this for the same Saturday as the next /r/torontoevents meetup - then we could shoot lasers together all afternoon and tend our wounds with booze in the evening.)

As for location, I think the best option is the Laser Quest @ 1980 Eglinton Av E, it's not too far away and it's fairly accessible by transit.

Let me know what you think!

**UPDATE: So it looks like Saturday is the preference by a large margin, with some people wanting to do an all-nighter event. I'm personally interested in doing this on a Saturday afternoon (most likely on April 13) and that's what I'm going to plan for at this point, but if this thread ends up spawning 2 events - an afternoon one and a late night one - that's all the better.

The Toronto Urban Photography Festival (TUPF) is looking for more people to help out for 2014. We’ve got the following positions available:
Vice Executive Director
Communications and Marketing Director
Fundraising Director
Curatorial Director

And the following assistants:
Assistant Financial Director
Assistant Activities Director
Assistant Communications and Marketing Director
Assistant Community Engagement Director
Assistant Curatorial Director
Assistant Fundraising Director
Assistant Special Projects Director
Assistant Technology Director

Basic duties are meetings once a week over skype or in person (roughly an hour each week, up to two hours), planning and organizing items according to your title, and helping out with other duties.

All positions are volunteer and unpaid (even the executive director!). Position starts immediately upon ‘hiring’ and will last to when the festival ends (unless you love us so much you decide to stay on for TUPF15). Right now a lot of these positions are self-directed (hence being the director!), but you will receive (and give) help and advice from (to) all of the other directors, and we will not let you flounder. Depending on the job, it shouldn’t take up much more than a few hours a week depending on your title and dedication. More will be requested incremently as we near the actual festival.

The festival for 2014 is tentatively scheduled for 27 June to 12 July (depending on availability of gallery/workshop space and other planning things). 

If you’re interested in helping out for any of the positions, or want to know more, feel free to email us at [iwanttohelp@tupf.ca](mailto:iwanttohelp@tupf.ca). Tell us a bit about you, your interests, and what positions you would like to apply for. We will get back you as soon as we can.

Last month's event went quite well and we got a pretty decent sized group together.  Lets see if we can get even more ents out this month!  

I heard some complaints that doing a daytime meet was a bad idea.  This month, we will start the event at 5pm.  This should give us time to build up an appetite for KBBQ or other munchies later on in the night.

**Venue:** [Vapor Central](http://www.vaporcentral.com/Location.html). I will confirm their availability closer to the date of the event. If they are closed, I will either change the time or move the venue to the hot box cafe in Kensington Market. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup (it has happened once before), we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there.  

Like last time, I will try to keep a big poster of the orange-red envelope either on the table or nearby.

**Time:** November 20 @ 5pm.  DJ music starts at 9pm.  We can move the event's start time accordingly if enough people prefer that.

**Cost:** $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage.  Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

To make this month's event special, lets aim to construct a megadoob.  I'm not saying we need a [70 gram beast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaJQsxZD-G4), but based on the turnout from last month, we can probably get something substantial in the 8-10 gram range.

Pacific Rim is Guillermo del Toro's latest film, featuring giant robots fighting monsters and apparently quite a few scenes filmed around downtown Toronto. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=baw1FAzKuCo), description:

&gt; When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes-a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)-who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse. (c) Warner Bros

You might remember that I posted about this event [a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1burn7/toronto_love_bluth_arrested_development_party/) while it was still in the early stages of planning. Since then, a number of changes and new details have emerged, so I wanted to give everyone an update...

1) The event date is no longer the 17th. Please don't go to the Office Pub this Friday dressed as a Never Nude, because you will probably be all alone and it's well-known that Never Nudes do best when there are dozens of them together.

2) Details on our trivia competition have been worked out and you can find them [HERE](http://explodingzebra.com/bluthparty/). The most important point is that we have a grand prize now and it's... *drumroll* [A SEGWAY TOUR](http://i.imgur.com/nKKyn3F.jpg?1) of the Distillery District - courtesy of the fine folks down at [Segway of Ontario](http://www.segwayofontario.com/)! 

We currently have close to 100 people RSVPing on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/309045482556360/), so if you're planning on attending (especially if you want a good place to sit for trivia), then I would recommend coming out early. Doors officially open at 7:30 PM (and trivia starts at 8:30), but I'll probably have things set up as early as 7.

Oh, and for anyone that didn't see the first post - I'm organizing a big Bluth bash next friday at the Office Pub (117 John St) and there's going to be trivia and costumes and dancing and classic episodes (which you can vote for [HERE](http://explodingzebra.com/bluthvote/))! It's going to be awesome and you should come out. Yeah, there's a $5 cover, but you could win that Segway tour or other prizes!

Also: because it's in a bar, the event is 19+. Sorry, young'uns, you may want to take this opportunity to do a [Charlie Brown walk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNRUjnp-5Rw). :(

First up, I just want to say thanks to everyone who has organised a meetup here, you're all doing an amazing job!  To keep the meetups fresh, I would like to open the floor for suggestions on where else we could have meetup lites.  Picking a meetup location isn't easy: we need to have cheapish drinks, space for anywhere from 15-30 people, near transit, patience staff and the ability to split bills.  Do you know a place that might fit the bill?  

To get things started, here's a list of the bar's we've been to in the past two years, with their various pros and cons.  

* Crown &amp; Tiger
 * *Pros: cheap. Cons: small*
* Green Room
 * *Pros: cheap, couches, where TO meetups started. Cons: size.*
* Pour Girl
 * *Pros: very cheap, they owe us one as they misplaced my booking last time. Cons: size, they forgot the booking.*
* Rhino
 * *Pros: very cheap, tons of room. Cons: a little out of the way*
* Betty's
 * *Pros: tons of room, proved with the global. Cons: a more expensive*
* Fox &amp; Fiddle (Bloor)
 * *Pros: let you have the back room, karoke. Cons: service is only ok*
* Toby's
 * *Pros: very cheap, the most amazing table I've ever seen. Cons: bit divey.*
* Menalon
 * *Pros: meh. Cons: not enough room, broken chairs, tiny glasses, no separate bills, expensive*
* Bistro 422
 * *Pros: very cheap, mini pitchers of spirits. Cons: small, an aquired taste*

1374021903.0	1igbbc	[JULY 28] /r/Trees Meetup - High Park Edition	kobrakae	24	7	22	"So the /r/Trees meetups kind fell off the bandwagon after May.  That's partially my fault, as I got so wound up with school I lost complete track of time and space.  But it's the summer, and in the summer, we Toronto ents used to venture to one of Toronto's many fine parks to enjoy nature in the best way we know how.  

In the past this has mainly taken place at Trinity Bellwoods, but while very central geographically, it's not quite as accessible transit-wise, especially if you hate dealing with street cars in the summer.  I have recently located an excellent spot for quiet hangouts in High Park that is literally two minutes from Keele Station. 

Here are the details:

* **WHEN:** Sunday, July 28th @ 4:00pm.  Putting this a little later in the afternoon so we avoid really bad afternoon sun and gets some shade near the trees.  We will be meeting at the entrance to High Park at 4:00pm.  At 4:15pm, we will venture to the entmoot clearing and find ourselves a spot.  At 4:20pm, well.. stuff happens.

* **WHERE:** High Park, in a clearing just off of Keele &amp; Bloor.  Here is an awesome graphic I created using my epic Google Maps and MS Paint skills to better illustrate the location: http://imgur.com/pfceHGB

* **HOW TO FIND US:** After leaving Keele station, on the opposite corner of Keele &amp; Bloor there is an entrance to High Park.  If you get there before 4:15pm, we should be hanging out there.  If not, go in, and in just a few paces you should see a dirt path on your left that leads into the trees.  Follow it.  You'll come to a clearing, where we will find a spot to set up.  Not sure about the exact location within this clearing yet but will post on the day of where we are for people who arrive late.  I will also bring some sort of landmark item to set up by the group so people can spot us.

* **WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, drinks, snacks, blankets for sitting on, frisbees, dodgeballs, dogs, etc.  I live close enough that I will attempt to bring a cooler with some drinks as well.  

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Come anyway.  We share.  We're awesome like that. :D

* **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A relaxing afternoon the park with chill, fun Toronto ents, possibly with some activities, definitely some good conversation.  I might bring Werewolf with me - if you haven't played, you'll enjoy it.

EDIT: So, I'm thinking that we should do this next Wednesday. How is that? I was thinking that we could start closer to the top of the river -- so by the time we hike all the way down, you can all just TTC back to the city or something. 
 I know how to bus there, but I don't know if that's something people are willing to do.

We could start here ( 2 buses from Finch station, one relatively short one, then a transfer onto a fairly frequent bus ), then hike along the river until we get to the zoo. That distance is approx. 20km

My friend Matt has spent the past couple of years trying to sustain a standup show, and his most recent one at ""The Bar With No Name"" (Keele and Bloor) has been gaining steam steadily. That said, his last show got screwed over because some of the acts had to cancel. Now the bar owner is having talks with a lady who doesn't even do comedy, and she wants to take over the show instead. Promotion and competition have been hard enough without the bar's help, and now he needs to prove to them the show is worth keeping. 

The thing is, most independent/open mic shows take forever to gain traction, and most bars are reluctant to keep it going if the returns aren't there right away. Two of the best shows in the city are run by the same veteran comic because she got to keep them going for years. 

I want to help, I've been friends with him for a few years and the show is one of the few things he really cares about. And to be honest I don't know how much I'll be able to do for him, but what the hell, least I can do is let it be known this is going on. The show is every Friday

TLDR: Comedy show on Friday at 1651 Bloor West in immediate need of audience support. It wont be the end of the world, but it will almost definitely be the end of his show.

1307718635.0	hwfac	/R/Trees/Toronto - Ents Meetup - June 18 - Outdoors edition	eMaddeningCrowd	20	3	39	"Typically, these are held at at Vapor Central on the third Saturday of each month.  However, the weather has been warm and sunny lately.  Do we really want to sit around on couches in an enclosed, smoke-filled space?  Or do we want to do this in a big park and enjoy the evening as a picnic of sorts to really enjoy the spring properly?

Unless there's a large vote against it, lets meet under a big tree on June 18 around 4pm at Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen near Ossington.  Obviously, this means the meeting area is massive, so we need a staging area for the first half hour while people show up.  Perhaps a starbucks or a local bar for a pint or two before we trek out?  I'm not familiar with the area so suggestions are encouraged.

Since we're doing this outdoors, non-ents are welcome to join in on this as long as you don't mind a bit of second hand smoke.  If you do mind, you can find another tree to chill under while we smoke our trees.

What to bring (Beyond the obvious)

* A blanket/towel/sheet to sit back on (optional)

* Frisbees (duh)

* A ball or two

* A guitar or tam tam drum if you want to make some music

* Some snackage or beverages if you want to munch on stuff

If the weather sucks, we'll do the Vapor Central thing and meet there at 5pm.  I'll update this post the night before if there are changes

**EDIT**
The tricky part of this meetup is that we don't really have a designated meeting spot. So here's what we do:

For those coming early, we'll meet at the gates of Trinity Bellwoods at 3:30 sharp. From there, we'll trek out into the park and look for a nice spot under the sun somewhere.
People that come late should look around the park for some balloons and a kite or two flying around.

Despite the fact that 4/20 falls on a Saturday this year, I decided to keep our meetup to Sunday in case people have made other plans.  Also, I am hoping that this will be our last meetup at VC for a little while - not that I don't love the place, but I'm crossing my fingers that May will be warm enough to get back out to Trinity Bellwoods, because this winter has been going on far too long.

*UPDATE*: So it turns out that PerplexD of /r/TOTrees is planning some [shenanigans for 4/20 proper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOtrees/comments/1cex95/totrees_420_meet_up/)  We will still have our monthly meetup as originally scheduled though.  His event will be a downtown trees adventure, and the monthly will be for day-after chillaxation and recovery, or for people who can't make it to Saturday.  This weekend, everyone should have a chance to meet some new friEnts.

Detailed details:

* **WHERE**: Vapor Central - 667 Yonge St. (Just south of Charles, near Bloor Subway). 18+ Establishment, $5 Daily Membership Fee Required. Soft drinks and snacks available for purchase.

* **WHEN**: April 21st, 4:20pm

* **HOW TO FIND US**: First and foremost, ask whoever is working at the front desk where you pay your cover fee. I will be informing them who we are and to send people are way if they ask about reddit. Barring that, we are almost always on the couches near the front by the stage, and I will try to have some sort of Reddit-related sign on display as well. I will also update this thread once we have situated permanently with our location.

* **WHAT TO BRING**: Trees, snacks, drinks, toys, games - whatever you'd like.

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY**: *UPDATE -*It has come to my attention that Vapor Central has a no sharing policy that I was previously unaware of.  I'm not going to change the venue for this month, but we'll see if this new news affects planning for future meetups.

* **WHAT TO EXPECT**: Fun people in a relaxing environment. Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we chat, we chill, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.

If you have any other questions/comments about this meetup or future ones, don't hesitate to toss me a message.

I'd love to see some suggestions for possible projects as well as maybe some places to do the damn thing.

All (people, languages, ideas) are welcome, you certainly do not have to be a developer.

OK Cool - looks like we have enough nerds to contribute, let me set up something for us to opt-in and plan (I'd like to do this next Saturday if everyone's cool with that).

----

Sunday, June 3rd is the Toronto Ride for Heart 2012. It's a charity event where the Gardiner and Don Valley Parkway are shut down to cars, and cyclists ride to support the Heart and Stroke foundation.

**We're looking for more people to join our team** (team name: [Crank Addicts](http://www.kintera.org/faf/search/searchTeamPart.asp?ievent=482564&amp;lis=1&amp;kntae482564=4DAF7C46F5F34DB5AAD6461B53A7A108&amp;supId=0&amp;team=5060255&amp;cj=Y)). We've got two so far (myself and my brother, a fellow redditor), but we need at least 3 more people to participate. There are 3 different route lengths - [25km, 50km, and 75km](http://i.imgur.com/BAM2T.png). We're going to do the 50km, but I don't think there would be a problem if anyone wanted to do the 25 or 75km routes. 

The cost to register is ~~$55~~ (edit: apparently if you use the promo code ""CC2012"" it will waive this fee. Unconfirmed though), and everyone has to raise at least $100 in donations. It seems like a lot, but it's not that bad, and it's for a good cause. Also, you have until June 3rd to fundraise. When you sign up you can choose from a list of teams. Just scroll down until you find us (once again, our name is Crank Addicts).

If you don't feel like joining us but still feel like donating, feel free to go to our [team page](http://www.kintera.org/faf/search/searchTeamPart.asp?ievent=482564&amp;lis=1&amp;kntae482564=4DAF7C46F5F34DB5AAD6461B53A7A108&amp;supId=0&amp;team=5060255&amp;cj=Y), click on one of our team members and donate directly on their page. You can also donate directly to the group, but by donating on a member's page it helps us reach the $100/person fundraising minimum."	t5_2s0wq	True

We're holding a mini meetup this Friday at the [Crown and Tiger](http://bit.ly/IFNE9C), which is a lovely cheap bar with food on College between Bathurst and Spadina.

As usual, it's always at least one person's birthday, in this case we are going to have at least one round of 'Happy Birthday' for our dear moderator/organizer dobs (but not until midnight). Maybe it's someone else's birthday too! Maybe you're new and want a bunch of strangers to sing you Happy Birthday because no one else will. **WE ARE ALL ABOUT THAT.** 

We're generally a decent sized group that's fairly easy to spot, but if you're new and think you might having trouble finding us, feel free to PM me for my cell beforehand and I will point you in the right direction.

Sure, Team Friday night won't be happy about this, but it is what it is. The change is a matter of logistics more than anything else. The Artful Dodger won't give us the entire upstairs on Friday nights during the winter months so we're going with the next best thing.

The book was released in 2007 and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for non-fiction, won a National Books Critics Circle Award, as well as was shortlisted for the 2008 Samuel Johnson Price for non-fiction. The book does not rely much on dense musical theory analysis, but chooses to explore the major historical, philosophical and political turmoils of the 20th century, refracted through the classical and popular music of the time. 

While I'm sure the the Southbank Centre's festival will be a significant event for the ever growing appreciation of modern classical music, I was wondering if there would be enough interest in this subject matter, over on this side of the pond, for a book/listening club. If there's enough interest I wouldn't mind taking on the task of collecting various musical playlists for listening/discussion, as well as organizing music performance outings, since many local institutions (The Royal Conservatory, Canadian Opera Company, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, etc) are performing various works that Ross discusses.


Anyway, if you're interested, leave a comment and I'll try to organize a meetup group for this. If you're the kind of person that doesn't think classical music appeals to them, perhaps this would be an opportunity to explore some music which you wouldn't traditionally associate with ""classical music"".

Here are some various YouTube clips of various composers/compositions that Ross discusses (and which will also be performed in some manner in Toronto) this year: [Strauss' Salome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNI9EbZu2gs);
[Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMifv1ntm8E); [Britten's The Turn of the Screw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbE3uML3oI); [Arvo Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc); [Poulenc's Dialogue of the Carmelites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUXp-fpiD0).

It also gives me the opportunity to make a few changes in how we organize these get-togethers in the hopes of bringing in some new faces, and bringing back some old ones.

Last year, it was not uncommon for /r/trees meetups to reach 10-15 people.  Numbers have dwindled recently, and I feel that part of the problem has been a lack of better organization (posting the meetups with only a few days notice), as well as some confusion over certain details (such as how to track us down, is it okay to come if you're dry, what to expect, and the like).  I am hoping that we can remedy this for 2013.

For all of the old regulars, I would love to see some of you guys and girls make an appearance for the new year - and, of course, new faces are always more than welcome and encouraged.  Also, if you have any suggestions/improvements you'd like to see, or complaints about previous meetups you'd like to address, don't hesitate to voice your opinions loudly.

And now, the details:

**WHERE:** Vapor Central - 667 Yonge St. (Just south of Charles, near Bloor Subway).  18+ Establishment, $5 Daily Membership Fee Required.  Soft drinks and snacks available for purchase.

**WHEN:** January 19th, 4:20pm 

**HOW TO FIND US:** First and foremost, ask whoever is working at the front desk where you pay your cover fee.  I will be informing them who we are and to send people are way if they ask about reddit.  Barring that, we are almost always on the couches near the front by the stage, and I will try to have some sort of Reddit-related sign on display as well.  I will also update this thread once we have situated permanently with our location.

**WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, snacks, drinks, toys, games - whatever you'd like.  I would really love to try Cards Against Humanity if anyone has a deck.

**WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Don't let that stop you from attending.  We love meeting new people regardless and we're always happy to share with fellow ents.

**WHAT TO EXPECT:** Fun people in a relaxing environment.  Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we chat, we chill, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.

Spring is here and the weather is getting warm.  In addition to this weekend's Monthly meetup, lets get together in a park (assuming the weather is above 15 degrees and not raining out).  Once the weather is consistently warmer, we can consider moving the monthly's to the park as well like we did this previous summer.

Unless there's a large vote against it, lets meet under a big tree on Sunday  around 4pm at Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen near Ossington.  Specifically, there's a few big trees in D5 on this map here: http://torontoist.com/2011/06/clever_trinity-bellwoods_map_helps_friends_get_together.php

We will meet at d5.  Nobody ever seems to gather there so it's become our home (though, we should consider scouting for other possible locations away from the dog park)

Since we're doing this outdoors, non-ents are welcome to join in on this as long as you don't mind a bit of second hand smoke in the park  If you do mind, you can find another part of the circle to chill with if it gets offensive.

What to bring (Beyond the obvious)

Not a terribly high-brow movie this week but I've seen the trailer and how could you go wrong with Tina Fey and Paul Rudd?  I'll be at the upstairs ticket machines at 6.50pm, ready to head in shortly afterwards.  We'll go for dinner somewhere nearby afterwards.  

The movie: 
&gt;Straight-laced Princeton University admissions officer Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is caught off-guard when she makes a recruiting visit to an alternative high school overseen by her former college classmate, the free-wheeling John Pressman (Paul Rudd). Pressman has surmised that Jeremiah (Nat Wolff), his gifted yet very unconventional student, might well be the son that Portia secretly gave up for adoption many years ago. Soon, Portia finds herself bending the rules for Jeremiah, putting at risk the life she thought she always wanted -- but in the process finding her way to a surprising and exhilarating life and romance she never dreamed of having.

A film so bad that I've been holding back on it, like some sort of perverse vintage wine - waiting for just the right night to release its wonderfully putrid glory.

That film is SAMURAI COP.

If you've always been tempted to come out to Bad Movie Night - but never been able to commit - then I implore you to join us on April 21st. This isn't a bad film that has a few funny moments. This is a cinematic miracle that is drenched in awful goodness from first frame to last. 

Still not convinced? [Watch a clip from the film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6gk04xzN3U) where the Samurai Cop confronts his archnemesis, the Horny Nurse.

Oh, and then we'll be watching YETI: GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY afterwards - an Italian King Kong knock-off that was shot in Toronto.

If anyone needs my cell (help finding the place or if you're late, pm and Ill give it to you).

E-Sports Canada is proud to announce it’s first ever dota 2 Tournament.  The tournament will take place on April 13th down at Net Effect Café (9 Isabella St).  This is our first venture into the Dota scene so we decided to start out small and gauge the community response to such events.

The buy in will be $15 per person ($75 per team) and it will be a double elimination format and capped out at 6 teams.

**Rules:**

The tournament will be in a Captain’s Mode and using the hero pool that is currently available in Captain’s mode (No Centaur Warrunner, Drow Ranger, Troll Warlord, Tuskar and Slark).

Teams will flip a coin and the victor will decide what side they want (Radiant = First pick/Ban). 
Admins will come over in the case of a dispute and settle any issues should they arise. 

**Prizes:**

1st : $300

2nd: 1 10 hour Time Package to Net Effect.


The tournament will begin promptly at 11 A.M Saturday April 13th. 
If we see a growing interest in the Toronto scene for Dota 2 related events we will host much bigger tournaments and open up prepayment to this event.

1361226206.0	18s0is	Movie Tuesday: Side Effects at 7.40pm at the Scotiabank cinema, dinner and drinks afterwards	YellowPoison	17	3	9	"Hi everyone,

Man, tough choice this week as there really isn't much of much on.  Reading the reviews, Side Effects has good reviews and a good director, so let's give it a shot.  
   
I'll be waiting at the ticket machines downstairs at the Scotiabank at 7.10pm, ready to head up soon after. 

The movie sounds interesting, surprisingly for the score, of all things: 
&gt;Once a successful New York couple, Emily and her husband are now struggling to readjust to life after his recent release from prison. Emily is plagued with a clinical depression and, following a car crash, is referred to respected psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Banks who offers the latest in prescription drugs to try and alleviate her anxiety. However as Emily's relationship with both Dr Banks and her prescribed medication intensifies, she finds herself descending into a chemical-fuelled nightmare where the lines between fantasy and reality become dangerously blurred. This is a riveting psychological thriller where neither the symptoms nor the cure are quite as straightforward as they seem.

It's not anywhere near as depressing as my last choice, I promise!

Warm Bodies is a romantic comedy first and foremost, but I can't say no to any movie with a zombie setup, and in a sea of supernatural romance movies it's gotten better reviews than expected. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4d2uwQicR3U), description:

&gt; A funny twist on a classic love story, this is a tale about the power of human connection. After a zombie epidemic, R (a highly unusual zombie) encounters Julie (a human survivor), and rescues her from a zombie attack. Julie sees that R is different from the other zombies, and as the two form a special relationship in their struggle for survival, R becomes increasingly more human - setting off an exciting, romantic, and often comical chain of events that begins to transform the other zombies and maybe even the whole lifeless world.

Description:
&gt;""Argo"" chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis-the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades. On November 4, 1979, as the Iranian revolution reaches its boiling point, militants storm the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, a CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist named Tony Mendez comes up with a risky plan to get them safely out of the country.

I'm a Korean-Canadian male ent in my mid-30's and was actually born in North York, but moved to the States when I was 9, so the city is still new to me.  After four years we moved to Vancouver, where I went to UBC and worked as a manager at a print shop while moonlighting as a DJ.  I'm into sci-fi, films, music, games and social justice/copyright issues.  I missed the last meetup, but I hope to meet some of you at the next one.  Thanks for reading!

Hey all,

A few of us will be meeting up at the [Crown and Tiger](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=crown+%26+tiger&amp;hl=en&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;cid=0,0,12162503432857391723&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A) this Friday at 7:00 pm. These lite meetups tend to get a dozen to two dozen attendees and newcomers are totally encouraged.

Crown and Tiger is a little dive-y, but the food isn't completely toxic, several $10 beer pitcher options and four shots for $12 of tequila and jager. It's also fairly transit accessible. There're almost always a few of us around past midnight, but the bar itself tends to get cramped around 10.

In fact, I've actually totally organized the game down on paper. It should work really well! Hopefully!

I would be willing to go, run the game for most of the rounds until someone else could take over for me, and get all of the materials together. I just need a place to go and a group of people! I need a location!

I need a place with a round table, preferably. We are going to be loud. We need a decent amount of space. We need a place that will be cool with us being there just to play a game and probably grab some drinks and a little bit of food.

What time do you think I should organize this for? Middle of the day was my plan, but maybe closer to evening would get more attention from people? I have NO CLUE where to go either since I'm actually about 45 minutes away.

***TL;DR AT BOTTOM***

Hey guys!

Ho-ho-ho! It's ***STORYTIME!!!*** Gather around children!

***In a little town called Toronto - the capital of Canada (sorry Ottawa - Mayor Ford said so)***

One day, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was busy little guy, working at the local corporation. After a rough Q4, Timmy said to himself, 

&gt;*""Golly me, look at the time!*
&gt;
&gt;*This year's been so busy, I can hardly rhyme!* 
&gt;
&gt;*Nevertheless, It's time for a treat*
&gt;
&gt;*I know! I'll get something to eat!*
&gt;
&gt;*But where oh where should I go?*
&gt;
&gt;*Where the friends are abundant and where beer must flow!*
&gt;
&gt;*But where can I find this magical place?*
&gt;
&gt;*Surely SOMEONE is on the case!""*
&gt; ***
&gt; ***-Little Timmy (1984 - 2014)***

Children! Can you help Timmy find a place where he can find food AND friends? Why don't we tell Timmy about this upcoming Potluck!

&gt;*Timmy, Timmy, don't you fear -*
&gt;
&gt;*For now is a joyous time of year.*
&gt;
&gt;*Beer, food, and friends - we have that in spades!*
&gt;
&gt;*With games to play - including Settlers and Charades!*
&gt;
&gt;*Taragine's Epic Christmas Potluck is the place to be*
&gt;
&gt;*Heck - it's even located near the TTC!*

So Little Timmy marked his calendar for the 22^nd of December - it was coming soon after all - just in a week's time! But he still had some questions...

&gt;*""Gee thanks, Mr. Voice-in-my-Head,*
&gt;
&gt;*Without you I would have been bored instead!*
&gt;
&gt;*But what should I bring, is there an RSVP, and where is the location?*
&gt;
&gt;*For this event that is supposed to be a joyous occasion!""*

**What should Little Timmy bring?** I know kids, why don't we make 2 options!

* **Option 1** - ""I'm going to contribute in cooking! I'll be bringing seasonal food for three!"" (like a big ass bowl full of salad or squash - note pop and chips are already covered, and yes, if you want to come early to cook, feel free to).
* **Option 2** - ""Every time I cook, things catch on fire and there is blood everywhere, and the constant stench of burning fles- well you get the picture. I'm going to bring 10 bucks to help offset the cost of a turkey and stuff!""

As for **RSVPing, Little Timmy can just shoot a PM** with his response - Heck, I'll even send him **my address**! But Little Timmy should act fast, as there are ***LIMITED SPACES***!

&gt;*Well I've made up my mind,*
&gt;
&gt;*I'll be going! All my ducks are aligned!*
&gt;
&gt;*I let Taragine know what I'm bringing,*
&gt;
&gt;*and of course, told him I'm going!*
&gt;
&gt;*Just one last thing - before I say au reviour*
&gt;
&gt;*Can you repeat that please, just in the form of a TL;DR?""*

Hi guys,

I'm going to be making a purchase on [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com). I was in the final stages of ordering and then I saw the dreaded FREE-OR-CHEAP-SHIPPING-UNLESS-YOU-ARE-IN-CANADA-THEN-YOU-ARE-SHIT-OUT-OF-LUCK. So I was thinking - instead of paying for the ENTIRE shipping myself, that I should ~~loop in~~ invite OTHERS who are wanting to order from ThinkGeek, and we can all pay for a reasonable shipping / tariff amount instead of giving the execs at UPS an extra bottle of champagne for their Christmas party. 


**The Deal** 

* Orders are due on Friday @ 5
* Shipping fees and tariffs are split by dollars spent. i.e., if you are paying for an item that is $10 and the full order is $100, and shipping + tariffs and tax are $20, then you pay for $12 total. Your percentage will be PM'd to you at 6:00pm. 
* Any savings from coupons will be split between the group by percentage spent (see above for example) - I have a $10 off $60, which I think will still be valid for Friday.
* When ordering, please PM me your name, and phone number so I can confirm your order - sorry for breaking anonymity, but I'm not going to place an order if I don't have any way of contacting you and verifying your order.


**Payment and Pickup** 

* Pickup is available in my neighborhood (Etobicoke) or most Reddit events (I show up to most monthly and lite meetups). I can also drop off at Oakville, as that is where I work.
* Cash on pickup or EMT. EMT must be received before pickup.


**Current Tally**

Total Spent: 296.69

Shipping Quote: 56.54

Tariffs: TBA

**Orders in USD - not including tariffs**

I have a question though.  Did anyone accidentally pick up a huge green and white knitted scarf off the table under the coats?  I had one going in, and didn't have one going out, though I did indeed look for it.  If anyone could point me towards where my scarf can be found, I would very much appreciate, and would somehow find a Reddit-y way to repay the kindness.

Thanks dudes, hope to see you next month!"	t5_2s0wq	True
1327330064.0	osw8b	Planning meetup picnic for mid to late April. 	Tmcn	16	2	15	"Well basically when spring shows it's beautiful face, we all travel downtown, go to a nice park (ie. Queen's park, Nathan Phillips, High Park, places like that) and have a huge picnic. It wouldn't cost a whole lot, GO transit is pretty cheap for people coming into the city, and you could just bring your own food. It would give us all a nice chance to leave our dark rooms to see the outside world, and maybe meet some cool people. Who knows!? Anyways, I really want to do this. SO if you guys and girls are interested, comment?

Trinity Bellwood Park seems like a very popular choice in the other threads.

Here are details for those who're interested to come:

Venue: Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there. (This pretty much never happens, so don't worry.)

Time: January 21 @ 5pm

Cost: $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: [http://www.vaporcentral.com](http://www.vaporcentral.com)

What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards. Also, Vapor Central does have a limited selection of snacks available for purchase in the form of pre-packaged candy and chips and the like, but feel free to pack some of your own food if you'd prefer.

It's just so much better and less awkward than meeting at VC.  Plus it also allows our non-ent brethren to show up and enjoy themselves in typical meetup-lite fashion.


Unless there's a large vote against it, lets meet under a big tree on August 20 around 4pm at Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen near Ossington.  Specifically, there's a few big trees in D5 on this map here: http://torontoist.com/2011/06/clever_trinity-bellwoods_map_helps_friends_get_together.php

We will meet at d5.  Nobody ever seems to gather there so it's become our new home.

Since we're doing this outdoors, non-ents are welcome to join in on this as long as you don't mind a bit of second hand smoke in the park  If you do mind, you can find another part of the circle to chill with if it gets offensive.

What to bring (Beyond the obvious)

* A blanket/towel/sheet to sit back on (optional)

* Frisbees, balls, and hackey sacks (duh)

* A ball or two

* A guitar or tam tam drum if you want to make some music

* Some snackage or beverages if you want to munch on stuff

If the weather sucks, we'll do the Vapor Central thing and meet there at 5pm.  I'll update this post the night before if there are changes

For those coming early, we'll meet at the gates of Trinity Bellwoods at 3:30 sharp. From there, we'll trek out D5 on THIS MAP http://torontoist.com/2011/06/clever_trinity-bellwoods_map_helps_friends_get_together.php "	t5_2s0wq	True

But hey, we've scored a few seemingly happy people for the [workshop](http://www.hotpopfactory.com/workshops/?p=draftprint3D) this way so why not right? 

This workshop is hosted by my little shop [Draft Print](http://www.draftprint3d.com) and presented along with [Hot Pop Factory](http://www.hotpopfactory.com). 

So, what will you get for you hard earned dollars by attending this thing? 

You will learn the basics of a very 3D print friendly modelling program called [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/) followed by the printing of whatever you design in said program. Design templates are provided but not necessary to follow. If you're willing to be patient and possibly wait until the end until things calm down, we can 3D scan you using [ReconstructMe](http://reconstructme.net/) and give you the file. 

Also, we've done a few of these intro sessions in the past and are in the early stages of designing a new workshop focused around the customizable world of 3D printing. If you have any thoughts on what might be interesting, let me know here. (eg. scanning yourself, then putting head on action figure or something body followed by file cleanup or... just an idea).

A Breaking Bad Party Night - Saturday, August 10	sovietmoustache	19	6	6	"After the wonderful success of the last big trivia night/party I organized ([Toronto Love Bluth](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1ebx5z/toronto_love_bluth_an_arrested_development_party/)), I've decided to follow it up with a tribute to another awesome TV show: Breaking Bad.

The final half-season of BB starts Sunday, August 11th, so I've booked this party one evening prior to celebrate.

Here's the details...

**What:** A Breaking Bad party with a trivia competition, costume contest, and a compilation of memorable scenes from the show!

**When:** Saturday, August 10th - Doors open at 7:30 PM

**Where:** The Office Pub (117 John St.)

**How much:** $5 cover (which includes entry and participation in all the night's festivities)

**Age Restriction:** 19+ (Sorry, the bar isn't all ages).

I'd also like to say a couple other things...

1) Thanks to everyone from Reddit that came out to the Arrested Development party in May. It was great fun for me and I hope you enjoyed yourselves as well!

2) I learned a lot from running the last party and I'm going to emphasize the successes / tweak the failures to make sure this night is even better. For instance: the video component of the trivia competition? That'll be back! As for the costume contest, I'm going make sure it happens earlier in the evening.

**Don't miss out, this is one party that's really going to mineral!**

Description:
&gt;The comedy This Is The End follows six friends trapped in a house after a series of strange and catastrophic events devastate Los Angeles. As the world unravels outside, dwindling supplies and cabin fever threaten to tear apart the friendships inside. Eventually, they are forced to leave the house, facing their fate and the true meaning of friendship and redemption.

Although the reviews haven't been amazing, I kinda want to see the Great Gatsby.  Since 3D is apparently the way to go with this one, let's go do that!  I'll be waiting by the far ticket machines at 6.50pm, ready to head in shortly after as you should be near the middle for 3D, etc, etc.  We'll go for dinner and drinks somewhere nearby afterwards.

&gt;The film follows Fitzgerald-like, would-be writer Nick Carraway as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz and bootleg kings. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super-rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.

That's there because if you're like me, you proooobbably didn't read the book.

This Saturday (May 4th) is supposed to be 18C and sunny,  so even if the trees aren't in full bloom it should be an amazing day for a picnic!

What is hanami, you say?  Find out more here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami 

The plan:  I will attempt to arrive no later than 11 am on May 4th to secure an area under the trees at the hillside gardens (map---&gt;  http://www.highparktoronto.com/images/cherry-trees-here.jpg )  Please bring a lunch and beverages for yourself.  I will provide some snacks and beverages based on the response to this post.  I will be going no matter what, but I would love for you to join me at your leisure. :)  Around noon we shall begin our feasting and merriment.  If we wish to continue our fun, we can see about finding a pub in the afternoon.

Getting there:  There is parking, but I HIGHLY encourage you to take transit, because on weekends spaces are very limited for vehicles... ESPECIALLY when the sakura are blooming.  Parking tickets are pricey and transit is greener, anyway!

This will be a great opportunity to socialize, eat delicious food, and enjoy the fleeting beauty of the cherry blossoms.  I have gone four years in a row now, and it has always been great fun to see people taking pictures, running around in cosplay, and having wonderful picnics.  Not new to reddit but new to meetups?  New to reddit in general? All noobs welcome!  PM me if you have any questions or need more information.

Upstream Color is the second movie by Shane Carruth, best known for his 2004 movie [Primer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film\)). Primer was an impressively low-budget time travel movie that managed to develop a cult following either due to or in spite of its complicated plot structure.

She is unknowingly drawn into the life cycle of a presence that permeates the microscopic world, moving to nematodes, plant life, livestock, and back again. Along the way, she finds another being-a familiar, who is equally consumed by the larger force. The two search urgently for a place of safety within each other as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of their wrecked lives.

It's Tuesday which means I'm late posting this but also movie time!  If you need to know more about The Place Beyond the Pines than Ryan Gosling, it's as follows: 

&gt;Luke (Ryan Gosling) is in constant motion, a high-wire motorcycle stunt performer who travels from town to town with the carnival. Passing through Schenectady in upstate New York, he tries to reconnect with a former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes), only to learn that she has in his absence given birth to their son Jason. Luke resolves to forsake life on the road and to provide for his newfound family, taking a job as car mechanic with Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). Robin soon discovers Luke's special talents, and proposes to partner with him in a string of spectacular bank robberies. But it is only a matter of time before Luke will run up against the law -- which comes in the form of Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper).

I'll be by the far ticket machines at 6.30pm, ready to head in fairly soon afterwards.  We'll go grab dinner somewhere nearby afterwards.  If you're new and would like contact info, shoot me a PM

There aren't any particular stand out movies this week so let's go for something a little different.  According to the description:
&gt;""Samsara"" takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation that will transform viewers in countries around the world, as they are swept along a journey of the soul. Through powerful images pristinely photographed in 70mm and a dynamic music score, the film illuminates the links between humanity and the rest of the nature, showing how our life cycle mirrors the rhythm of the planet.

The description is a bit dry **(EDIT: TL;DR: He has a cat that can open doors)**:

&gt; The film examines this complex intersection of artistic practice and social activism as seen through the life and art of China's preeminent contemporary artist. From 2008 to 2010, Beijing-based journalist and filmmaker Alison Klayman gained unprecedented access to Ai Weiwei. Klayman documented Ai's artistic process in preparation for major museum exhibitions, his intimate exchanges with family members and his increasingly public clashes with the Chinese government. Klayman's detailed portrait of the artist provides a nuanced exploration of contemporary China and one of its most compelling public figures.

So I recommend checking out the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tinpH50fs28&amp;feature=player_embedded#!), which emphasizes his social impact and trouble with the government.

a variety of walks
a variety of workshops

If interested please pm me or email me from the site. I will put you on the mailing list for meetings (held over skype and in person).

I was thinking that we could have a bunch of mono line in channels running to the sound board that people could plug laptops, drum machines, sequencers, and instruments into; and everyone would collaborate to create dance music.

The people experienced at mixing and mastering would take turns on the board, indicating time signature for each round and managing the mix from all the contributors who would be generating drums, bass, fills, etc., and even vocals if we get some singers showing up.

We have a dance floor so choreographers and dancers could come and share/show off moves, look for partners/recruits. The dancers could even make requests for specific rhythms or beats.

I think it could be a fun meet, greet, and beat for the music/dance production scene in Toronto. Maybe make it a monthly thing if it is popular enough.

Hope everyone had a nice time. Thanks to YellowPoison for making the reservations, and to the staff of The Artful Dodger for putting up with the moderate amount of ridiculousness any internet group causes.

Lucas is a highly-regarded school teacher who has been forced to start over having overcome a tough divorce. Just as things are starting to go his way, his life is shattered.

1329419060.0	psnxo	[February 18th] /r/trees meetup!		17	3	15	"Here are details for those who're interested to come:

Venue: Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there. (This pretty much never happens, so don't worry.)

Time: February 18 @ 5pm

Cost: $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com

What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards. Also, Vapor Central does have a limited selection of snacks available for purchase in the form of pre-packaged candy and chips and the like, but feel free to pack some of your own food if you'd prefer.

Come one, come all. You don't have to be an ent to enjoy hanging out with us. That being said, unfortunately they ID at the door, so 18+ only. "	t5_2s0wq	True

Thanks for awesome meetup y'all. To all those who missed out, DAMN you missed out. Should've come. LOL!!!

Peace Y'all!

EDIT: Awesome Pee Journeys! 

LOL!

""wiggly wiggly!""

Update: I remember the Vapor Lounge was kind of quiet because everybody was stoned. Two girls showed up and left for Harry Potter (how was that?) and Emad showed up late and disappeared after five seconds. The two other Redditors I chilled with initially also disappeared.

Group got more chatty at the Korean place cuz we were all stoned and it was lol AND THERE WAS FOODSTUFFS FROM THE GODS. I split water on myself but could not give a fuck.

We went to a place and another place but I did not know where we were going. Then we all chilled at some bar and had awesomepants time full of awesomepants. 

Left at 1:14 AM to go to St George subway but their shit was all retarded (coin machine didn't work) but some lady gave me her pass for the Bernard subway and SUCCESS!

Went west then south by accident, then north for the correction, missed second last Younge bus north because of failed Pee Journey (bathrooms closed WTF! Held in that shit like a boss), waited for last 2:48 bus with two people wearing headphones (one guy was eating a hit dog. BOMB!) and the aforementioned complainer on phone dude.

Got to my street at 3:10 (successful Pee Journey into random bush), got home at 3:40, made this post on Reddit, finshed listening to Who album I was on (LOVVE DUN DUN DUN REIGN ORRR MEEE) and went to sleep. Now I am here.

I'll be attempting to host a MTG Draft/Casual session for anyone interested in playing/dusting off their old decks. I've contacted 401 games and they said they should have enough play space to accommodate even though they have some events going on. I'm expecting no more than 10-15 people but the more the merrier. This event is for the new and experienced, any play level/experience is welcome.

One block South of College subway station

We'll start at 5PM and I don't expect us to be there for more than 2 hours at the most. We can get some food and then head on over to the Monthly meet up afterwards for those who desire! Draft will probably be limited format. If we don't have enough players for the draft we can simply just play with our regular decks. Please bring your own lands if you can! I don't know if 401 can supply any. 

EDIT: To make things easier, I'll have a reddit sign printed out for the table that we're at. We'll be up in the second floor most likely. I'm the asian dude with a blue columbia jacket. We're a friendly bunch so come join us :)

It's an event that started in 2008 as an idea between a group of friends for a holiday party and in the span of a couple of weeks spun into a sell out crowd at Mod Club that raised $25K, and it's just kept growing from there.

This year's event is coming up in just three days and I'd love to see some redditors out all the details, and tickets can be found at [http://hohoto.ca](http://hohoto.ca) - we've sold out every year and are expecting to do it again this year. 

So if you're looking for a fun way to do some good this year consider coming out and joining us. If you do come out - drop me a PM and we can figure out how to connect/meet at the event.

Some other details:

We draw a broader mix of people every year &amp; all are welcome - you're guaranteed to find lots of technology, start-up, marketing &amp; PR and social oriented folks at this event. It's a great event to network, meet some new people &amp; usually bump into someone you haven't seen in a while. 

In addition to a great party, we've always got a massive raffle (we're anticipating ~$12K worth of prizes this year) and a great photobooth photographer if you need to get your avatar updated for those 'other' sites.

By popular demand and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is adorable, let's go see Silver Linings Playbook at the Varsity cinema at 7.20pm.  It's sitting at 90% on Rotten Tomatoes so that's a good sign.  I'll be waiting by the far ticket machines at 6.50pm, ready to head in shortly after to make sure we get seats.  

Description: 
&gt;Life doesn't always go according to plan. Pat Solitano has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother and father after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet. When Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them.

We'll be presenting Death Bed: The Bed That Eats - a ridiculously awful piece of late 70s cinematic trash that's about a demon-possessed bed with a hunger for human flesh (though you may have been able to figure that out due to the hilariously blunt title).

We've booked the 3rd floor of the Office Pub (117 John St.) down in the entertainment district. There's a projector/screen setup on that floor, so we're watching the movie on something better than a normal tv. Also: there's reasonably priced booze! I figure that, if you're going to watch bad movies, it's more or less ideal to have a casual environment where everyone can chill on couches, get a little drunk, and shout at the screen when bad dialogue or a special effects failure happens.

I'd like to meet more people in Toronto that have an ongoing love/hate relationship with shitty cinema - so if that's you, please consider joining us that night!

1339015083.0	uojog	Fans of BBC's Sherlock, June 14/16 &amp; 21/23 - Frankenstein starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller.	blackston3	13	3	1	"Hey guys,

Anyone a fan of BBC's Sherlock? 

This past March, the London (UK) National Theatre opened up a show based on the popular Mary Shelley book 'Frankenstein' starring BBC's Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch and ironically [CBS's upcoming (also modern day)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUJeWvpat-M) Sherlock starring Jonny Lee Miller as the duo that is Viktor Frankenstein and his monster. Directed by Danny Boyle, of 'Slumdog Millionaire' fame.


Cineplex will be showing the stage production on their screens at select theatres on two dates June 14 &amp; 16th with Cumberbatch as the Creature and Miller as Frankenstein. June 21 &amp; 23rd's date will star Cumberbatch as Frankenstein and Miller as the Creature. Tickets are ~$18 but not sure if for both shows or each.

I read the Frankenstein book a few months ago, loved it and love Sherlock. I will be going with a few friends and decided to let T.dot reddit know. Since the Scotiabank Theatre is popular here, let's do the screening there and as for the dates, it will depend what's best for everyone. I was thinking Thursday nights.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The screenings are scheduled for 6:45pm as follows:

With Benedict Cumberbatch as The Creature - Thursday, June 14 - Saturday, June 16

With Jonny Lee Miller as The Creature - Thursday, June 21 &amp; Saturday, June 23

A few of us will be heading out to see [Moonrise Kingdom](http://www.google.ca/movies?q=moonrise+kingdom&amp;btnG=Search+Movies&amp;hl=en&amp;near=toronto&amp;ei=Mh3NT6jRLsju0gHCn4SaAQ) tomorrow night at the [Varsity](https://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=varsity+cinema,+toronto&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=varsity+cinema,&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON&amp;cid=0,0,4774230073355077225&amp;ei=6x3NT5bKHsma0QGjq9jJAQ&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ved=0CBkQ_BIwAw). We'll start meeting around 7:15 in the lobby, aiming to head in for 7:30. As always we'll do food/drinks somewhere nearby after.

Moonrise Kingdom is Wes Anderson's latest film and cast with most of his regulars, so fans of his films should have a pretty good idea of what to expect. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ocac5Umhb9g), description:

&gt; Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, two twelve-year-olds fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness. As various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is brewing off-shore -- and the peaceful island community is turned upside down in more ways than anyone can handle.

Newcomers welcome as always! Message me for a cell number if you'd like help finding us. The Varsity itself is a bit hidden (third floor of the Manulife) but I'm happy to play guide if needed.

[Tenacious D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenacious_D), I would assume, needs no introduction.  Click the link if the name is unfamiliar.

[The Protomen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protomen) are a progressive rock band whose concept albums are based on a dark, dystopian version of the Megaman universe.  They've recently gained popularity both on Reddit and from Video Game High School.  I recommend [The Hounds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBcDoZnN8ac) and [Light Up The Night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkLvpt9Z3fA) if you've never heard their stuff.

[Tickets available here.](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1000487AC4769476?artistid=807254&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1)  

Because it's general admission, I also wanted to gauge whether or not other redditors attending and want a good vantage point would be interested in some sort of early meetup/hangout.  I've never been to Echo Beach before but it sounds like a nice spot to chill for an afternoon.

PROTESTS CONTINUE IN TAKSIM, IN ALL OVER TURKEY, IN ALL OVER THE WORLD! 

WE CONTINUE STAYING IN SOLIDARITY WITH GEZI PARKI/TAKSIM OCCUPIERS AND PROTESTING AUTHORITARIAN TURKISH GOVERNMENT!! 

TO KEEP IN SOLIDARITY, JOIN US THIS SUNDAY @ QUEENS PARK @ 2:00 PM!

LET'S RAISE OUR VOICE AGAINST VIOLENCE 
&amp; 
FEEL FREE TO BRING YOUR SHAKERS, ANY INSTRUMENTS TO VOICE WITH RHYTHM !

PRESS RELEASE (MAY, 31, 2013)
International Human Rights Organizations and Dear Friends, Comrades, Press Members from all over the world; 

This is an urgent call from human rights defenders, activists, NGOs, professional chambers, grassroots, neighborhood associations and Istanbulites.

Since the 27th of May, Istanbulites from all social and political backgrounds and ages and from all over the city had been continuing a peaceful resistance in Gezi Park, the city's largest public park, soon to be demolished due to a so-called renewal project. This Project foresees the erection of a big mall (designed as the replica of the once Ottoman Artillery Barracks) in the place of those trees.

The police intervened in the park 3 times, each more violent than the other:

The first intervention was in the morning of May 28th, a crowd of about 50 protestors were tear-gassed directly in their faces.

In solidarity with the protestors, hundreds arrived in the evening and the occupation movement grew bigger. Right afterwards, the second intervention came early in the morning of May 30th at 5 am. The riot police set fire to the tents and tear gas and pepper sprays were used incessantly, causing serious injuries.

Against this inhumanity and extreme violence, the reaction was the occupation of the park, this time by thousands.

At the moment, brutal intervention against the protestors continues. The group has been pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed once more as they were leaving the area after reading their press call! At the moment, some are in Divan Hotel at Elmadag, having taken refuge there from the effect of the gas attacks.
Literally, almost all of Taksim Area, where Gezi Park is, is tear-gassed and
pepper gas-sprayed; especially the side streets around Taksim Square are under clouds of gas.

And this morning proved to be the culmination of violence and barbarism that no words can describe, with an unproportional use of force. The exit of the park was blocked by the police, thus locking the group in the park. The protester were then taken under crossfire of tear gas and pepper bombs, nearly getting choked to death. The only way out was by breaking the walls and many were wounded during this escape.

The resistance for democracy and human rights will not be terminated; we are determined to continue our struggle against a government determined to crush each and every opposition, a government that cannot tolerate even a peaceful opposition for saving trees. 

The present Turkish government has violated all international human rights conventions and mechanisms it is a party to.

Simultaneous protests are taking place in different cities of Turkey at the moment and we have been informed of other protests in London, New York City, Berlin and Amsterdam to support the resistance of the defenders of the Gezi Park. We invite all of you to show your solidarity with the peaceful protestors against the increasing authoritarianism of the Turkish government and its collaboration with the neoliberal capitalism. This violence is neither new nor unique to Turkey. What are at risk are the nature and the livelihood of people of the planet. 

Your valuable support and solidarity will indeed fortify our determination and resistance. 

Please share this news, name it and shame and blame the responsibles so that this insanity and brutality practiced against human rights defenders can be terminated through international pressure. "	t5_2s0wq	True

* WHAT TO BRING (besides the obvious): drinks/munchies, some board/card games or other sources of entertainment, and good vibes.

* WHAT TO EXPECT: Friendly people in a fun and relaxing environment. Vapor Central has Volcanoes, leather sofas, and entertaining stuff playing on the TVs. We chat, we chill, we joke around. We play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out nearby for a bite afterwards.

* RULES: 18+, no tobacco (this includes blunts and e-cigs), no alcohol, and no dealing/mooching.

Also, don't worry if you are dry as there is typically enough to go around.

So in honour of all the broken dreams, this month's Bad Movie Night Toronto is presenting two movies that aren't just bad, they're so incompetently produced that it will boggle your heretofore sweet, innocent minds.

First off... **BIRDEMIC**!
Cheap CGI birds go maverick and attack a small town. They explode (?) when they fly into things! You'll need to flip a coin to decide what's more lifeless though: the birds or the actors' line readings

And then... **DÜNYAYI KURTARAN ADAM**!
Otherwise known as Turkish Star Wars, this film doesn't plagiarize the Star Wars story, but it does steal tons of footage from the franchise - allowing the world to finally know what a Turkish man piloting a TIE fighter might look like. As an added bonus, this movie will teach you how to get buff by punching and slapping rocks!

A few of us will be heading out to see [Django Unchained](http://www.google.ca/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Toronto,+ON&amp;sort=1&amp;mid=5adfea0299c0169f&amp;tid=95e0c803d3559fad&amp;ei=tyziUOrtFs6brQH2jYGoBA&amp;date=1) tomorrow at the [Scotiabank Theatre](https://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=scotiabank+theatre&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=scotiabank+theatre&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON&amp;cid=0,0,10338934543637613031&amp;ei=Iy3iUK3UONPaqQHnl4DwBQ&amp;ved=0CL8BEPwSMAA). The show starts at 6:50 pm so we'll aim to meet in the lobby starting around **6:20** and head in by around 6:30. As usual we'll go for food somewhere nearby afterward.

Django Unchained is Tarantino's latest movie, starting Jamie Foxx, Chris Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Cf6z1BJo2UQ), description:

&gt; Set in the South two years before the Civil War, Django is a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles - dead or alive. Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South's most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda, the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. Django and Schultz's search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie, the proprietor of ""Candyland,"" an infamous plantation where slaves are groomed by trainer Ace Woody to battle each other for sport. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Stephen, Candie's trusted house slave. Their moves are marked, and a treacherous organization closes in on them. If Django and Schultz are to escape with Broomhilda, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival...

Karaoke upstairs, cheap beer ($3/bottle) until 11:00pm. Karaoke fills up 11:00pm and later which means 10:00pm is perfect for fuelling up on amazing nachos downstairs and slightly less cheap beer ($3.50/bottle) OR singing in front of an empty-ish room because you're not drunk enough for a large crowd. Up to you ;)


I'll be there at 10:00. Feel free to take my number if you can't find me/us.

* Venue: Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there. (This pretty much never happens, so don't worry.)

* Time: June 30th @ 4pm

* Cost: $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

* Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side (just south of Charles St E). More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com

* What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards. Also, Vapor Central does have a limited selection of snacks available for purchase in the form of pre-packaged candy and chips and the like, but feel free to pack some of your own munchies if you'd prefer.

Come one, come all. You don't have to be an ent to enjoy hanging out with us. That being said, they do ID at the door, so 18+ only.

I'll be the one at a table with a [Sully doll](http://www.fatwallet.com/static/attachments/64534_sully.jpg) on it. If anything just ask for the reddit group at the door. I'm pretty sure they recognize us by now."	t5_2s0wq	True

The movie seems to be loosely based on [the meme by the same name](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/safety-not-guaranteed), and stars Aubrey Plaza (best known from Parks &amp; Rec). The trailer makes it look a little romantic-comedy-heavy, but critical reception has been great. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=L0BY2hbESHk), description:

An unusual classified ad inspires three cynical Seattle magazine employees to go looking for the story behind it. They discover its author is a mysterious eccentric named Kenneth, a likable but paranoid supermarket clerk, who believes he's solved the riddle of time travel and intends to depart soon. Together, they embark on a hilarious, smart, and unexpectedly heartfelt journey.

About 30 km, a full loop starting and ending at Trinity-Bellwoods. 
Would start at the tail end of or after the morning rush and end some time before/around noon for (optional) lunch. If anyone has a suggestion, the route could end there.

The current plan is roughly 20 km, a fair bit along the waterfront trail. 

We can lengthen this route by going further up the Humber, possibly all the way to Eglinton, before turning back. Figure this has more time flexibility because we'll be on the Martin Goodman and Humber paths most of the way. 

We'll meet at Trinity Bellwoods' northwest corner starting around 9:45 and leave by 10:00

This monday at 7pm at the hacklab (170a baldwin st.) Hacklab.to is kicking off monday night workshops with the first Toronto RepRap User Group Meetup. We want to bring the 3d printing community together here so really any and all robot apocalypse enthusiasts are welcome.

The plan is to meet up, do a bit of 3d printer show and tell and then have a free-for-all of 3d printing stuff; we'll print some stuff and build some stuff and fix some printers that don't print so well. Oh yeah and your welcome to BYOB + Bring your own printer.

If you just want to see these things in action we should have at least 1 working machine and a whole lot of problematic ones (yeah, they glitch up allot). Right now it's looking like 2 Mendels, 1 Darwin, 1 Makerbot, 3 Prusa prototypes (in progress), 1 Deltabot prototype (in progress)

Cheers,
Rob

PS. oh right, what are 3d printers/repraps/any of this crap? well to put it quickly: machines that grow objects out of plastic and can print their own parts (sort of early precursors to star treck replicators). Lots more infos at [reprap.org](http://reprap.org).

Other people have suggested next Saturday, October 2nd. People are interested in getting some foliage shots, so I've suggested that Photowalk 1 be held at High Park.

Easiest way to get there via TTC, Get onto the College Streetcar (or, apparently the bloor-danforth line as well), and head west until the end of the line.

*What're we going to do?*
Simple, as a group we will whip out our over priced cameras, and take some pictures. We can then share them with fellow redditors. 

While there, we can meet up at at the TTC stop right at the base of High Park if you like - We can start our walk at 8AM, while meeting around 7:30-8AM.

I'm willing to try and teach anyone all I know about photography, so feel free to ask me any questions - I'll be the kid with the fedora saying he's the kid in the fedora.

Basically, we should be just doing a walking tour through High Park. Feel free to separate and go your own way, it'll just be nice to be able to explore together. High Park is massive.

*What should you bring?*
Your Camera, any lenses/supplies, food if you get the munchies, and preferably a pretty lady or gent who likes to be in photos? If you know anyone who wants a nice professional early morning portrait, let me know.

I'll be bringing my tripod as well, if anyone wants to borrow it feel free to ask. 

If anyone wants my number to contact me, shoot me a PM.

I plan on having a few of these (weather forgiving) in the future. Look forward to it everyone.

Mud describes fantastic scenarios-he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life, Juniper, who is waiting for him in town. Skeptical but intrigued, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him. It isn't long until Mud's visions come true and their small town is besieged by a beautiful girl with a line of bounty hunters in tow.

We went to a movie at the lightbox recently and show a preview for a very interesting documentary on the Shining, complete with conspiracy theories.  Sure, I like the book better and get angry with how it's nothing like the Stanley Kubrick version.  Doesn't stop it from being an amazing movie. 
   The film is on at 6.50pm a the lightbox and I'll be waiting in the lobby at 6.20pm.  We'll head in shortly after.

&gt; Many cult movies have their own radical interpretations but none as rich and far-ranging as Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. In this documentary, we hear from people who believed they have decoded the far-reaching theories, hidden symbols and messages buried in the late director's film. Carefully examining The Shining forwards and backwards, Room 237 is equal parts captivating, provocative and pure pleasure.

1362154674.0	19gvap	Dachshund UN! - Saturday, March 2 @ 2 PM - Harbourfront Centre!	sovietmoustache	12	2	2	"It's been advertised heavily in Toronto media over the last week - but if you're not in the know yet, [Dachshund UN](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/worldstage/dachshundun) is a performance art piece staging a meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee with dozens of wiener dogs in the place of human delegates.

So yes: it's an utterly batshit insane-o art project that has inexplicably seized the spotlight of the Harbourfront Centre's World Stage. While it's been talked about as a joyful performance to delight the senses, it honestly seems like more of an Dadaist deconstruction of the UN - presenting a bunch of well-bred animals in positions of authority, friendly and barking loudly, but utterly clueless as to what's going on around them. Indeed, these dogs are just as likely to solve an international problem as the real UN!

Anyways, it should be a lot of fun and I'm going to check it out tomorrow so I can coo and aww over the utter adorability of these fuzzy, furry wieners! There's also an 87% that I will bark at the dogs, though this is less likely if I determine that such behaviour will get me kicked out.

If you want to come with, let me know!

Admission is FREE, but it sounds like this event is über-popular, so I reckon we'll need to get there early (1 PM?) to claim our place in the theatre (audience capacity: 350)."	t5_2s0wq	True

[Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kvhAaD4ophU), description:

&gt; Lifelong friends Wilf and Reggie, together with former colleague Cissy, are residents of Beecham House, a home for retired opera singers. Every year on Giuseppe Verdi's birthday, the residents unite to give a concert to raise funds for their home. But when Jean Horton, a former grande dame of the opera fallen on hard times, also Reggie's ex-wife, moves into the home to everyone's surprise, the plans for this year's concert start to unravel. As old grudges threaten to undermine past glories and theatrical temperaments play havoc with the rehearsal schedule, it becomes apparent that having four of the finest singers in English operatic history under one roof offers no guarantee that the show will go on.

I apologize for the tight timing: Showtimes are pretty limited. I'm willing to pick up tickets for a couple people if it helps with timing. :)

&gt; Marty (Farrell) is a struggling writer who dreams of finishing his screenplay, ""Seven Psychopaths"". Billy (Rockwell) is Marty's best friend, an unemployed actor and part time dog thief, who wants to help Marty by any means necessary. All he needs is a little focus and inspiration. Hans (Walken) is Billy's partner in crime. A religious man with a violent past. Charlie (Harrelson) is the psychopathetic gangster whose beloved dog, Billy and Hans have just stolen. Charlie's unpredictable, extremely violent and wouldn't think twice about killing anyone or anything associated with the theft. Marty is going to get all the focus and inspiration he needs, just as long as he lives to tell the tale. 

So far I've heard nothing but good things, with a great cast and comparisons drawn to In Bruges.

Description, via Rotten Tomatoes:

&gt; A man who smuggles celebrity viruses to ravenous fans gets infected with the same bug that killed a media darling, and becomes locked in a deathly race against time while becoming the target of biological collectors. Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones) works for The Lucas Clinic -- a company that reaps a tidy profit by infecting willing clients with viruses taken from their favorite celebrities. Earning a little extra cash on the side by using his own body to smuggle out popular microbes, Syd finds himself in mortal danger after he infects himself with a pathogen taken from Hannah Geist -- a gorgeous superstar who later dies as a result of her illness. Now, it's only a matter of time before Syd succumbs to a similarly gruesome fate. When Syd's shady clients and a rival company discover he's carrying a bug that could revolutionize the industry, he must fight back with the only weapon he has -- his own virulent blood.

Fun fact: The film is written and directed Brandon Cronenberg, David Cronenberg's son and Ryerson grad. And judging by the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIZb50HiBCo) he's following in his father's footsteps (Warning: Graphic).

I've seen a lot of people who have posted comments in the past about how they had thought about going but were worried about not knowing anyone, or were dry, etc.  I want to assure any ents or non-ents reading this and thinking about coming that we are awesome, fun, and laid back (as ents tend to be).  You should totally come out!

Regular meetup schedule - meet up at Vapor Central around 5pm, have fun and build up an appetite, and for those feeling especially adventurous (and hungry), some people like to hit up the nearby Korean BBQ place afterwards around 8-9pm - we'll play that by ear.


* Venue: Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there.
 

* Time: October 15th @ 5pm


* Cost: $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.
 

* Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com
 

* What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards.  Also, Vapor Central does have a limited selection of snacks available for purchase in the form of pre-packaged candy and chips and the like, but feel free to pack some of your own food if you'd prefer."	t5_2s0wq	True

I'm going to try to plan this a little better for everyone. I was thinking of some bike-ry next Saturday (the 24th). It'd be some time mid-day, since I figure everyone would prefer milder temperatures.

Looking at roughly 40 km, something like Beaches/Humber or Humber/Leslie Spit. Mostly waterfront, unless there's overwhelming desire to go up Humber or the Don Valley. "	t5_2s0wq	True

Might as well let the tradition continue since Saturday is the 'official' meetup and we haven't missed on having  yet. 

Same basic schedule as every other trees meetup - we will start the event at 5pm. This should give everyone time to build up an appetite for all you can eat KBBQ (or an alternate source of munchies if there are vegetarians or other diet restrictions in the group) later on in the night - probably around 8pm.

**Venue:** Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there.

**Time:** May 21 @ 5pm

**Cost:** $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com/Welcome.html

What to bring (beyond the obvious):  Cards and board games.  Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards. "	t5_2s0wq	True

Going along those lines I'm wondering if there are any other musically inclined people who want to get together and do something.  Thinking more on the acoustic side so guitar, bass, banjo, lemon shakers, maracas, african drums, anything really that you can move around without having to worry about cords and what not.

What would be really cool if we could get people who don't play instruments and they could come along and sing, etc.  Well that's my piece, haven't been to the /trees meetups yet but hoping to once school winds down :)  

Also it wouldn't be restricted to anyone, so if anyone wants to just come by and hang out that would be great, we'll be able to get a nice audience going.  So like a regular meetup except much more muscially oriented.

Let me know folks!

Edit: Location will be a bit of an issue because we need open space to sit around it.  I'm thinking it would be possible to book rooms at U of T St.George and make it happen that way.  If you guys got any other ideas for location throw em out there."	t5_2s0wq	True

We can also make it the weekly meetup-lite as well.

1) We go eating at Sushi D, then troll down to a bar or something.

2) Head north to the Yonge/ Eglinton Mandarin, and drink somewhere around there.

Showtime is 7:50, so we'll start meeting around **7:20** near the ticketing machines. We'll also find somewhere for some quick food and drinks nearby after the movie.

The movie came out just this past week, so **I strongly recommend buying tickets in advance**.

Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's latest movie, best known for District 9, starring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley. The movie hasn't received quite the critical acclaim of District 9, but if the trailer's any indication it's retained a lot of the same style. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=TlW0I8MniSM), description:

&gt; In the year 2154, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance to bring equality to these worlds is Max, an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well.

New people always welcome! Message me for a cell number or detailed on how to track us down.

1375898864.0	1jwckt	[AUG 11] /r/Trees Mini Meetup - High Park - 3pm	kobrakae	12	5	17	"(Reposted with correct date)

So two weekends ago, several of us ventured into High Park and had a great afternoon with beautiful weather, and this coming Sunday looks like it's also going to be great also.  So as discussed at the last meetup, I'm organizing a follow-up.  I realize this falls on the same weekend as the main Reddit meetup and that we've gotten our meetup times all skewed, so if you can't come out that's totally cool - but if anyone wants to come chill with me feel free!

Here are the details:

* **WHEN:** Sunday, August 11th @ 3:00pm.  Putting this a little later in the afternoon so we avoid really bad afternoon sun and gets some shade near the trees.  We will be meeting at the entrance to High Park at 3:00pm.  At 3:15pm, we will venture to the entmoot clearing and find ourselves a spot.

* **WHERE:** High Park, in a clearing just off of Keele &amp; Bloor.  Here is an awesome graphic I created using my epic Google Maps and MS Paint skills to better illustrate the location: http://imgur.com/pfceHGB

* **HOW TO FIND US:** After leaving Keele station, on the opposite corner of Keele &amp; Bloor there is an entrance to High Park.  If you get there before 3:15pm, we should be hanging out there.  If not, go in, and in just a few paces you should see a dirt path on your left that leads into the trees.  Follow it.  You'll come to a clearing, where we will find a spot to set up.  Not sure about the exact location within this clearing yet but will post on the day of where we are for people who arrive late.  I will also bring some sort of landmark item to set up by the group so people can spot us.

* **WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, drinks, snacks, blankets for sitting on, frisbees, dodgeballs, dogs, etc.  I live close enough that I will attempt to bring a cooler with some drinks as well.  

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Come anyway.  We share.  We're awesome like that. :D

* **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A relaxing afternoon the park with chill, fun Toronto ents, possibly with some activities, definitely some good conversation.  I might bring Werewolf with me - if you haven't played, you'll enjoy it.

Free from their parents' rules, their idyllic summer quickly becomes a test of friendship as each boy learns to appreciate the fact that family - whether it is the one you're born into or the one you create - is something you can't run away from.

There isn't a ton on this week but a while ago I saw the trailer for this movie and it was funny so let's go see it.  It's on at the Rainbow Cinema at 7pm, I'll be waiting by the piano at 6.30pm.  Feel free to PM me if you'd like contact details but keep in mind that once we head in at about 6.40pm there isn't cell reception.

Description:
&gt;Superstar magicians Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton have ruled the Las Vegas strip for years, raking in millions with illusions as big as Burt's growing ego. But lately the duo's greatest deception is their public friendship, while secretly they've grown to loathe each other . Facing cutthroat competition from guerilla street magician Steve Gray, whose cult following surges with each outrageous stunt, even their show looks stale. But there's still a chance Burt and Anton can save the act-both onstage and off-if Burt can get back in touch with what made him love magic in the first place.

Wouldn't it be cool to actually understand, in a broad sense, how it all works?

I'm a researcher in AI, robotics and space. I LOVE technology. I did software engineering as my undergrad. I also love teaching, and philosophy. I would love to get into public speaking and comedy! Hence a little practice.

It's based on a [series of prank calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_prank_call_scam) in the US where a mystery caller pretending to be a detective would coerce managers into strip-searching their coworkers. These stories became a bit of an urban legend and matter of online interest back during the height of Fark and Digg. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6YA0KVmLoI&amp;feature=player_embedded), description:

&gt; Becky and Sandra aren't the best of friends. Sandra is a middle-aged manager at a fast-food restaurant; Becky is a teenaged counter girl who really needs the job. One stressful day (too many customers and too little bacon), a police officer calls, accusing Becky of stealing money from a customer's purse, which she vehemently denies. Sandra, overwhelmed by her managerial responsibilities, complies with the officer's orders to detain Becky. This choice begins a nightmare that tragically blurs the lines between expedience and prudence, legality and reason.

What's Bernie? Jack Black playing a gold digging assistant funeral directory, notable for Jack Black apparently managing to play a character other than... well... himself. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB2hUl1KbFk), full description:

&gt; Assistant funeral director Bernie Tiede was one of the town's most beloved residents. He taught Sunday school, sang in the church choir and was always willing to lend a helping hand. Everyone loved and appreciated him, so it came as no surprise when he befriended Marjorie Nugent, an affluent widow who was as well known for her sour attitude as her fortune. He frequently traveled with Marjorie and even managed her banking affairs. She became fully dependant on Bernie and his generosity, and he struggled to meet her increasing demands. He continued to handle her affairs, and the townspeople went months without seeing her. They were shocked when it was reported that she had been dead for some time, and Bernie was being charged with the murder.

Time: March 3rd @ 5pm

What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards. Also, Vapor Central does have a limited selection of snacks available for purchase in the form of pre-packaged candy and chips and the like, but feel free to pack some of your own food if you'd prefer.

The availability is from 6pm to 10pm, maybe a bit later if one of the cofounders wants to stick around. The address is 102 Adelaide East between Church and Jarvis, look for the ""102 MUSIC"" banner above. The door to the street is locked but press the buzzer and somebody will come let you in.

Compared to the bars and coffee places we've attended in the past this space will be much quieter, and there should be no competing for seats or power plugs. The space also has free WiFi, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and air conditioning (it's a co-working office). Bring along other food or beverages if you like, I'm thinking chips and cider myself.

I'd also like to start a new tradition (borrowed from other hacker nights) of people presenting a bit about their work or something that interests them. I'm happy speak for a few minutes about the software I'm working on, and if any other volunteers would like to talk that'd be cool. Anybody who wants to come do less technical work like writing is welcome as well. Please leave a comment if you intend to come so we can get an idea of the numbers.

The location is about a 5 minute walk from King station, and little further from Queen. You might save a minute or two taking the King streetcar to Church. I think there's street parking in the area, but it's not something I've attempted."	t5_2s0wq	True

Crosspost from [/r/toronto](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/i7h0u/are_there_and_old_school_pen_paper_and_dice_rpgrs/)

I'm an older gamer that lacks game nowadays, and setting a place for ad-hoc drinking and gaming with other older, experienced gamers is something I'd really enjoy. Maybe have multiple DMs and a 'House' binder that chronicles a shared world that anyone can join as either player or DM. I have an idea for a location (Bovine Sex Club on Mondays and/or Wednesdays), but would need enough people that are interested before I could pitch it to the owner - or we can just show up, start drinking and let it degenerate into character generation and encounters as the bartender gawks in confusion.

I'm open to any or all systems, generas, etc.

Someone offerd to host, but I'm looking to avoid having it hosted in a private residence. I'd like to choose a bar that has a slow night and a good seating space for 'taking over as the place for our scene to hang out in' so to speak as a public meet/play space. That would allow people that hear about it to just drop in, start multiple games, spin offs, no one needs to clean up after, we won't run out of beer. There are clubs/pub nights for different kinds of music, poetry, comedy, etc.; why not have a bar that is central to the GTA for RPGrs to hang out in and meet instead of relying on the occasional convention?

It's no surprise then, that Hollywood executives would practically trip over themselves to greenlight a cinematic masterpiece starring this musical prodigy. And thus, in the auspicious year of 1991, the world was bestowed with a universal blessing entitled **Cool As Ice** - the movie that launched the illustrious film career of Vanilla Ice, who went on to star in numerous flicks including Cooler as Ice, Coolest as Ice, Vanilla Dippity Doo: Revenge of the Iceman, and an Oscar award-winning adaptation of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar.

Just before we watch this ever-so-whimsical clusterfuck, we're going to check out a specially curated collection of the worst rap videos ever made (including songs by Shaquille O'Neal, the Insane Clown Posse, and Speak the Hungarian Rapper).

WHAT IF I'M DRY: Don't let that stop you from attending. We love meeting new people regardless and we're always happy to share with fellow ents.


WHAT TO EXPECT: Fun people in a relaxing environment. Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we chat, we chill, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.


If you have any other questions/comments about this meetup or future ones, don't hesitate to toss me a message."	t5_2s0wq	True

1358820004.0	1710xx	Movie Tuesday: Mama at Yonge &amp; Dundas cinema at 7.30pm, dinner and drinks nearby afterwards	YellowPoison	7	1	5	"Hi everyone,

So I managed to resist making the movie night The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D last time but I can't pass over Mama, with the excellent reviews it's getting.  The movie starts at 7.30pm at the Yonge and Dundas cineplex so I'll be waiting by the ticket machines upstairs at 7.  We'll go for dinner and drinks afterwards.

The Plot:
&gt;Mama is a supernatural thriller that tells the haunting tale of two little girls who disappeared into the woods the day that their parents were killed. When they are rescued years later and begin a new life, they find that someone or something still wants to come tuck them in at night.

""This is 40"" is Judd Apatow's latest movie starring Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann that gets alternatively compared to ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin."" [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UsklVopZj-c), description:

&gt; An original comedy that expands upon the story of Pete and Debbie from the blockbuster hit Knocked Up as we see first-hand how they are dealing with their current state of life. After years of marriage, Pete lives in a house of all females: wife Debbie and their two daughters, eight-year-old Charlotte and 13-year-old Sadie. As he struggles to keep his record label afloat, he and Debbie must figure out how to forgive, forget and enjoy the rest of their lives...before they kill each other.

Wink's tough love prepares her for the unraveling of the universe; for a time when he's no longer there to protect her. When Wink contracts a mysterious illness, nature flies out of whack-temperatures rise, and the ice caps melt, unleashing an army of prehistoric creatures called aurochs. With the waters rising, the aurochs coming, and Wink's health fading, Hushpuppy goes in search of her lost mother.

The idea of the mission is simple:

We ask you to either make gifts or buy some affordable presents. Spend whatever you think is reasonable ($1 items are fine!), or just make the gifts yourself! The more important part, is thinking about what type of gift would make you smile, and bringing that to life. Whether it is a some art you make, a yo-yo, candy canes, etc! Be creative, but make it personal! Then wrap each present individually!

Along with these gifts, we ask you write cards. Write a heart-felt message. Something honest and open. Maybe explain the present, wish them a happy holidays. And sign it.

Make as many gifts as you like. And keep track of what is in each one. So that you can hand it out to the right age/gender/type of person.

DETAILS:

When: 3pm, December 18th

Where: Meeting at Nathan Phillips Square

What happens: Unlike our other exciting events, we`ll basically just be hanging out. Roaming the streets, giving the gifts out to people who seem to need it. Maybe having some hot chocolate!

I've been coming out to /r/torontoevents meetups off and on over the last couple of years.  Having moved to the city from another province, it was a great way to meet new people.  But, all good things must come to an end.  I am heading off into the sunset later this week.  It was a great run, but various personal and practical reasons are driving me back home.

So why am I posting?  Well, in my times hanging out with you fine bunch, I've met a lot of cool people, but a bunch of you I only know as ""FirstName, from the monthly"", and I don't have other contact or even know a username on here!  I am having somewhat of a gathering of as many of the great people I've connected with in Toronto on Wednesday, and I wanted to come up with a way to reach out to those of who I don't have other contact info for.

I didn't want to post full event details as it's not a huge venue or anything, this isn't a ""meetup lite"" open to public meeting new people kind of thing.  But, if you have any idea who I am, you haven't heard from me via email or phone, and figure you ought to be at a bit of a going-away shindig for me, shoot me a PM with your name saying something to explain why I should know who you are :)  In the midst of moving I will probably do one mass check for replies tonight.

EDIT: As someone astutely pointed out, if I have a hard time knowing who ""FirstName"" is in terms of reddit username, others may have the same problem knowing who I am!  If you are a person who remembers names, I am one of the many named Jon.  If you are better with faces, you probably recognize me by my beard."	t5_2s0wq	True

&gt; One of the most highly anticipated films of the year, from the directors of Sweetgrass and Foreign Parts, LEVIATHAN is a thrilling, immersive documentary that takes you deep inside the dangerous world of commercial fishing. Set aboard a hulking fishing vessel as it navigates the treacherous waves off the New England coast-the very waters that once inspired Moby Dick- the film captures the harsh, unforgiving world of the fishermen in starkly haunting, yet beautiful detail. Employing an arsenal of cameras that pass freely from film crew to ship crew, and swoop from below sea level to astonishing bird's-eye views, LEVIATHAN is unlike anything you have ever seen; a purely visceral, cinematic experience.

&gt; ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" tells the story of an ancient war that is reignited when a young farmhand unwittingly opens a gateway between our world and a fearsome race of giants. Unleashed on the Earth for the first time in centuries, the giants strive to reclaim the land they once lost , forcing the young man, Jack, into the battle of his life to stop them. Fighting for a kingdom, its people, and the love of a brave princess, he comes face to face with the unstoppable warriors he thought only existed in legend-and gets the chance to become a legend himself.

I was wondering if any of you were interested in watching older film releases that get screened in Toronto. Right now I have my eye primarily on [TIFF's Bond retrospective](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2013/2440002191) and am planning to go see *Casino Royale* on Saturday at 2:45PM.  
I'm also interested in [*Laura*](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/2330009467) and half the films in TIFF's [Countdown to Armageddon](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/2440001198). Nothing better than spending your last week on Earth watching films at the Lightbox if you're a film lover like me, right?  
I know these are all the Lightbox, but I know other venues screen older films as well. This is just what I'm looking at in the near future / until the world ends anyway.

There's just a few things you should know about how unfun I might be to hang out with:

* I don't drink (usually) or smoke (anything).
* I am an introvert and a private person. (I still talk though. Sometimes. Maybe.)
* I'm bad with schedules.
* I don't own a cell phone, but can get my hands on one when necessary.

Hopefully there's enough interest in this sort of thing so that it becomes a large enough group and the above won't matter. Now that I've sold myself on not being fun to hang out with, other than that I don't bite (too hard) and am extremely nice. If you have any more questions, feel free to AMAA.

PM me for contact information if interested!

EDIT: I forgot to add, not a movie, but very much related: [The Bond exhibition](http://tiff.net/bond/about) has a 2 for 1 deal for Scene(Cineplex) members, which I assume everyone is, though I think only one person needs to have a Scene membership.

What to bring: trees (but don't worry if you're dry, we are a sharing bunch), snacks, drinks, maybe some board/card games.

I haven't her live (either her solo act or with Brian), but I hear her live acts are pretty amazing, especially with the Grand Theft Orchestra.  I was planning on getting tickets next week and would probably go by myself, but I was wondering if anyone else here was thinking about heading down too (or if you're talented enough, volunteer playing with them during the set)

Will they mess up? Say something vaguely racist? That's pretty much guaranteed, but you'll never really know unless you come and check it out!

I signed up and I don't have anybody to go with at this point. I've been to a couple of meet ups, big and small, and everyone seemed cool. So I figured, why not go with a couple of you guys or girls.

Next meetup bring either a blank colored shirt or even one with a simple design (Stripes?!) It can be brand new or you can revitalize an old favourite.

Next meetup I will bring a few stencil designs (And I'll post them here) and you guys can pick and choose what kind of Ent shirt you want. Then I can put the design on your shirt with bleach and give them back to you at the next meetup!

Menu: Amsterdam Brewing Co. 7.30PM	ConeFails	9	3	4	"Not too long ago, at a Reddit meetup lite, 4 inebriated youngens decided we should have a meetup that involves quality alcohol rather than just $10 pitchers. We subsequently came up with the /r/TorontoReserve . 

When: June 4, 7.30pm

Where: TBA

What: As much of the Amsterdam Brewing Co. line up that I can get my hands on

**Cost: $20 all in** This gets you a lot of beer and dinner, which will be a party platter!

All specifics regarding the to-be-consumed beer can be found on the website, which actually doesn't suck, SHOCKING! http://amsterdambeer.com/

If you have time, check out their beer so you can offer a modicum of educated input. If you want any Amsterdam merch. Pint glasses are 5.60 and shirts are 10. If you give me enough warning, I can have this stuff for you at the meetup.

**How this works:**

The first 9 people to express interest will be told the location. A list of usernames who have been given this information will be posted here with 2 alternates. If one of the 9 cannot make it, it is their responsibility to message an alternate with the location. This will not be policed in any way, common courtesy dictates success. This will be posted to /r/torontoevents on the 15th if we don't reach 9. and /r/toronto on the 18th if we still don't have 9. **(4 spots have already been claimed on /r/TorontoReserve)**

This is, first and foremost, a drinking club. We'll be sampling as much as possible. As this is our first meetup, there may be some kinks to work out, patience is admired. Until this new subreddit is off the ground, we will post our meetups here, as well as on /r/TorontoReserve

Same basic schedule as every other trees meetup - we will start the event at 5pm. This should give everyone time to build up an appetite for all you can eat KBBQ (or an alternate source of munchies if there are vegetarians or other diet restrictions in the group) later on in the night - probably around 8pm.

**Venue:** Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there.

**Time:** Sept 17 @ 5pm

**Cost:** $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.

Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com/Welcome.html

What to bring (beyond the obvious): Cards and board games. Bring whatever board games you have and a few decks of cards."	t5_2s0wq	True

What I wanted to propose is that all the first_time_comers get together somewhere in the park, before joining the larger group. I know that it can be hard coming to a meetup without knowing anyone there... like not knowing which group is the reddit group and things like that. As I have noticed from the comments, the reddit identifying signs are often missing or just hard to notice. 

Should have done this earlier, but hopefully it's not too late. **The main idea is to get more newcomers to go this time.** So if you always wanted to come but never got around to doing so - now is the time.

So if you like the idea, please reply to the thread. Coming alone or with friends, doesn't matter. We will agree on the details. 

**EDIT: so I'm gonna be at the park at ~ 11:30 and if someone wants to meet, just reply to this thread. If you have reddit on your phone, you can just reply from the park and we'll meet you. **"	t5_2s0wq	True

If you have any questions please PM me or ask in the thread. Depending on if we have a tournament you may want to bring a laptop, I do NOT recommend bringing a laptop unless you are driving (more information on the tournament to come).

1372775820.0	1hhykx	Movie Tuesday [2/7]: Monsters University 3D at the Yonge and Dundas cinema at 7pm, dinner and drinks afterwards	YellowPoison	10	3	3	"Hi everyone,

While I'm pretty sure it isn't going to compete with the original, I really want to see Monsters University, so let's go do that.  It's on at the Yonge and Dundas cinema at 7pm tonight, we'll go for dinner somewhere nearby afterwards.  I'll be waiting by the ticket machines upstairs at 6.30pm, ready to head in shortly after.  Please get your tickets beforehand, I don't know how busy the showing will be.  

&gt;Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski was a little monster, he has dreamed of becoming a Scarer-and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike's plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, ""Sulley"", a natural-born Scarer. The pair's out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University's elite Scare Program. To make matters worse, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right.

Edit 1- If anyone is interested, Cuddle Party Toronto was featured in an article-

http://www.thegridto.com/city/sexuality/hug-it-out/

Edit 2- For those who have asked, a Cuddle Party is a workshop where people come to learn how to say no to people. Every day we are bombarded by people ""asking"" us to do something for them without giving us a chance to really say no to them. Bosses, family members and even friends do it. At a Cuddle Party you must get permission to Cuddle with anyone and receive a verbal yes before you do anything. You don't have to cuddle anyone at a Cuddle Party if you don't want to.

* **RULES**: No tobacco (this includes blunts), no alcohol, and no dealing/mooching. ~~We've also never seen them have issues with e-cigs in the past.~~ ***After discussion with a staff member, I have been told e-cigs cannot be used inside Vapour Central***.

god made me funky is a great rock band that does a lot of dance songs.  Set 2 (around 9pm is their best).  This band could be playing stadiums, so its awesome they show up at street fest.  All 3 sets are nice enough to not disappoint anyone.

Phusion has a really nice sound.  Play a lot of 80s covers.  A few blocks east.  This is another band where their whole set is a good party.

In between, there is a lot of good traditional jazz.  Downtown jazz band is some really old guys that play very beautiful/sweet bluegrass/swing.  Very talented group and toe tapping sound.

Dr. Draw (near woodbine) is super high energy violin rock.

Juice (kinda playing far away east) have a lounge/jamiroquai feel, and at least one great song (http://www.juicemusic.ca/music.html (save me, walk away))  (the faculty and dirty are pretty interesting too)

This is toronto's best event of the year and its free.  Its best in very small groups though, because large group can't walk around aimlessly that well.   Let me know if you want to see Phusion or Juice before or after GMMF's 2nd set.

1334324411.0	s7wg7	Hey Fashionista's and DIYers of Toronto, free classes this weekend at DesignherCo Studio's grand opening. Let's show my GF that all this time I spend in Reddit is worth it. (x post from r/toronto)	benny2012	14	10	0	"(This is a cross post from r/toronto, my apologies if I did this wrong)

[Original Post] (http://redd.it/s63r5)

**Attention Toronto Fashionista's and DIYers of Reddit**, my GF is opening her studio this weekend with free classes between 10am and 6pm on Saturday and Sunday (April 14th/15th). Drop by and say hi. Oh and there will be free stickers.

Her website is www.designherco.com

The address of the studio is 1380 Bathurst Street 

There is limited free parking half a block north on the east side of the street. Of course, I recommend the St.Clair Streetcar or the Bathurst bus.

Here's a little invite I wrote just for Reddit:

This weekend will see the opening of a ""Craft Studio for the Crafty Fashionista"" on Bathurst St. just south of St.Clair. DesignHerCo studios will be hosting an open house this Saturday April 14th and Sunday April 15th for guests to sample free craft classes and explore the chic new space.


What I find truly incredible about this launch is not just the outstanding concept that is DesignHerCo, but that it has been 100% conceptualized, funded and brought into being by a young, female entrepreneur. In a world where women are still not paid on par and where entrepreneurship too often takes a back seat to the safety of a desk job, Dara (my GF) has created the possibility of her own big, beautiful success through inspiring creativity in others.


I am personally inviting you, your family and friends to stand with her and your community in doing what we can to ensure this possibility becomes a reality.



I look forward to meeting you all there and showing Dara that all this time I spend in Reddit instead of going to bed is a good thing."	t5_2s0wq	True

Please suggest whether you'd like to go on Saturday or Sunday. I'm thinking doing Saturday to be accommodating, as I don't know what others' Nuit Blanche plans are.

The route goes out to Humber Bay West, then up to Eglinton, before coming back down. There's two return routes available with different things to see. We'll likely go with the Rail Path as High Park is going to be fairly high-traffic on the weekends.

Grand total of about 35-37 km.

Returns via the West Toronto Rail Path

[Variant 2](http://g.co/maps/x5uzy)

I'm looking for people to get together once a week, possibly every other week if that's what people would prefer, in the downtown core. Preferably noobs in the 18-24 age range, GURPS will be used, and either the shadowrun or call of Cthulhu universes. I have quite a few years of rpg experience but this will be my first time GMing, so people new to the game that want to learn with me would be awesome. 

Pm or post if questions :)

**edit for clarification!** apologies to those I confused with jargon :)

GURPS is the gaming system I'd like to use, it stands for Generic Universal Roleplaying System. Basically, it's kind of like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but not exclusively high fantasy. You can really make any sort of character you want, which I'd be happy to help with. It's a really great system for games, it's simple, really inclusive of all genres, you don't need to purchase a set of special dice or anything, and it allows for endless creativity. I can also provide all the books as pdfs and have extra dice to go around.

The GM (game master) is the person who runs the game, plays the NPCs, enemies, moves along the plot, etc etc. Simply put, the storyteller.

Ideally, the game will be based on either Shadowrun (think Neuromancer/Bladerunner/post-apocalyptic sci-fi) or will be a Lovecraftian horror game. "	t5_2s0wq	True

Same basic schedule as last month - we will start the event at 5pm. This should give us time to build up an appetite for KBBQ or other munchies later on in the night - probably around 8pm.

**Venue:** Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup, we will meet at the Country Style across the street and make alternate plans from there.

**Time:** January 22 @ 5pm

**Cost:** $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage. Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.
Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com/Welcome.html

**First I need to let everyone know, I cannot be in attendance to this photo walk.**

If anyone in particular wants to step up and take over, post here and you can 'manage' everyone.

Otherwise, I'm certain reddit is full of mature individuals who can collect themselves in a proper manner, and take pictures together. Or not, whatever.

Anyway, the plans were originally as follows:

Arrive at High Park Station, off the Bloor Line at roughly 7:30 am.

Begin Photo Walk through High Park at roughly 8am.

Everyone help each other, take portraits of your friends, take some nice shots of scenery. It'll be awesome, promise.

It's been getting some pretty decent reviews so hopefully it is pretty decent!
&gt;After returning from the Second World War, a psychologically troubled drifter returns from the war and meets the charismatic leader of a new religion. The Master befriends the drifter to help him sort out his life and provide meaning. The drifter becomes his right-hand man and, after a while begins to question both his belief in the leader and his teachings as the organization grows and gains a fervent following.

We can meet at 9am, at the north entrance of Dufferin Grove Park. I think it would be good for the meeting place to stay consistent, but I'd like the route to change frequently so if anyone has any suggestions please bring them to the group.

But how many people have been to a Star Trek marathon where all of the characters are evil? And instead of the benevolent Federation of Planets, the Terran Empire stretches it's shadow of conquest over the entire Alpha Quadrant?

The plan is to show 7 of the mirror universe Star Trek episodes -in chronological order- spanning across 3 separate Star Trek series (Enterprise, Original and Deep Space Nine).

We'll be starting at 7:00pm on Tuesday the 12th, and going until around 2:00am. A projector and screen will be set up, a plounge will be in full effect. Pop in whenever you like, and leave whenever you must.

This is a somewhat silly version of what will hopefully be a semi-regular film night at Radiolaria. If any local film makers would like to get involved and/or screen some films in the future, please contact me.

Admittance is totally free, and the Radiolaria cafe will be selling coffee/juice and snacks. Feel free to bring a potluck-style meal to share with everyone.

* WHAT TO BRING (besides the obvious): drinks/munchies, some board/card games or other sources of entertainment, and good vibes.

* RULES: No tobacco (this includes blunts and e-cigs), no alcohol, and no dealing/mooching.

Also, don't worry if you are dry as there is typically enough to go around.

So, it was a bit of a hard choice, choosing the movie this week as there is a ton on, especially with all the older movies at the Scotiabank.  I looked, and none were on at a reasonable time for Tuesday so instead, let's go see Amour at the Varsity cinema at 7.05pm.  

Description:
&gt;Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers in their 80s, living in an apartment in Paris. One day at breakfast, Georges finds Anne staring unresponsive to his questions, seemingly frozen in time. In a few minutes she snaps out of it. She doesn't want to bother seeing a doctor, but Georges insists.

&gt;Anne has suffered a stroke, and her fear of doctors proves well-founded: They perform surgery leaves her right side paralyzed. When she's finally able to come home, she makes Georges promise to never take her to a hospital again.

&gt;Thus begins Anne's downward spiral, and Georges' struggle to care for his beloved wife.

Sounds super depressing but we should never shy away from a movie just because it might be a bit of a downer.  It has excellent reviews.  

I'll be waiting by the far ticket machines at 6.35pm, ready to head in shortly afterwards.  PM me if you'd like contact details.

I'm not posting this here as a suggestion that all of /r/torontoevents should come out and have an orgy with me. That sounds like it would be a very unsexy disaster, to be honest. Rather, this is an invite to anyone that is similarly curious, but might be on-the-fence about it due to nervousness or other doubts.

Sure, part of the reason I'm going to attend this night, whether or not this post gets a response, is because I'm a hedonistic libertine, but also because I think it'll be a fun story to say I've been to a Toronto sex club at least once. If the night turns out to be a bomb, I figure it'll be good for a laugh.

If you're interested in joining and are looking for someone to be the devil on your shoulder, encouraging you to do it, then send along a PM and I'll try my best.

My wife and I are returning to your fair city on Thursday-Sunday of this week, and we'd love to hear your suggestions about what we should do. 

Some background:

-We're in our late 20s, we've visited (and loved) Toronto before. We did some typical sight-seeing stuff (ferry ride, tour bus, CN Tower, baseball stadium, Second City show). The last time we came, we also walked around in a Chinese lantern show, which was an incredible and cool surprise. 
-We'll be staying in a downtown hotel, and we love walking. But we're also driving into town, so we'll have access to a car.

This would be a great opportunity to exchange the make-up and accessories you  rarely use for some new trendy finds. Are there any beauty and fashion enthusiasts who would be interested in going with me?

My friend said they'd also be handing out free beauty samples!! There's no cover charge!

Worth checking out, for sure.  I'll be there!

I talked a good talk about the movie meetups for those I met at the global, time to, uh, walk the walk?  I don't know, something like that.

I didn't realize this was such a big sport until she joined a team and I have yet to see a live game. I watched it on Rogers local channel a few days ago and it's amazing. Comparable to the Lingerie Football League, it consists of girls on roller skates wearing skimpy clothing and smashing into each other as hard as they possibly can. Also, you can get drunk while you watch and it's cheaper than a baseball game.

So months ago I planned to make the drive up two weekends in a row, first to see Explosions in the Sky, and then to see my man Sam Beam. But I hit the world's biggest crap shoot of traffic last weekend, and also made another short drive within the state earlier this week, so sadly I'm just not up for the drive. But I already bought my ticket, and I don't want it to go to waste. So I am offering it up here to one fine fellow redditor of Toronto, so I guess whoever claims dibs first gets it! I ordered it online so all I have to do is email you the pdf.
