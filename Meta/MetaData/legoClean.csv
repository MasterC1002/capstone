1374597169.0	1iw585	I just wanted to tell you guys something.	darkjedi1993	245	40	24	I wanted to say thanks. Thanks for a REALLY awesome subreddit that has re-immersed me in one of the best parts of my childhood. I didn't have the greatest childhood (I'll just stop there....), but legos always helped me escape my not-so-great world, and let me adventure with my imagination. A while back, I decided that I would leave my very LARGE lego collection to my little brother so he can experience all of the awesome stuff I got to. I have recently decided to start (VERY, VERY) slowly rebuilding my collection, and I'm not entirely sure it will ever be as big as it once was, but you guys have inspired me to do so. I can't thank you guys enough. Now my little brother and I can nerd out over what we've built in the time that we haven't seen each other. I should be posting pictures of my new collection soon.	t5_2qhm7	True
