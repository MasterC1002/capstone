**Another Edit:** For people having difficulty finding me on steam, [here is my steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/flobblem).




When I first started playing on hard servers I was amazed at how good all the players were, and how they were all willing to offer honest advice, praise and criticism of my playing style. 
As a medic I learned that I could support my team not only by healing, but also by using the xbow to take down scrakes, thus saving valuable ammo for the support guys. 
I learned that fleshpounds are incredibly vulnerable to grenades and that my medic armour could tank scrakes and fleshpounds if they began to charge, meaning I could save the life of squishier team mates. 
I began to wonder why it took me so long to start playing on hard servers, especially since after a while of playing on them they are becoming... well... easy. 

And then I remembered that, as a new player I found this game intensely difficult, indeed I would often die on the third or fourth wave!
On normal my teammates and I would run around willy-nilly, backpedalling into clots, jumping so I couldn't heal them or blowing ourselves up with grenades.
I remembered finding that I was constantly cornered, out of ammo and out of armour.
Back then the thought of me playing on a hard server was laughable, I wasn't fit for normal!

Last night I decided to go on normal again, mainly to train my support class (which is a woefully low lv 2) - and, readers, it had not changed one bit. 
I spawned after the 5th wave in WestLondon (a very easy map) to the sight of a lv 2 sharpshooter toting an m4, a lv 1 support with a flamethrower, a lv 2 support with dual magnums, a lv 1 commando with a LAR and lo and behold a single lv 6 commando with a scar running off into the distance.
All of the low level guys were running around ignoring the fact that they all had quite low health, leaving me to run around and heal them. 
I decided not to change to medic, but to stay as support and keep my mouth shut.

The round starts and sure enough the sound of a scar rattles in the distance. The newbies twitch and jump around nervously. I scan the top of the bridge for crawlers and stalkers. 

What followed was the most shambolic display of teamwork I have ever witnessed. 
Round after round the new players all die because there was no cohesion. They raged scrakes and fleshpounds and got cornered and butchered. 
The lv6 Commando did not share any of his money with the other players, leaving them with pistols and LARs on wave 8 and 9. 
When the patriarch came they did not stand a chance (I managed to carry by picking up the dead Commando's 'nade launcher).

I felt apalled that someone who was obviously more experienced at this very hard game would just leave these new players to it and not try to help. 
He left at the end of the map.

The next map loads and it is Office. 
This time I play medic. 
I ran around healing the team, typing advice and using my mic to direct fire and point out targets that each class should look for. 
I did not make fun of them for not knowing - what would be the point? 
I did not speak condescendingly - What's wrong with going a bit crazy and buying a husklauncher once in a while? They're new, they'll learn why it's a bad idea.
I clued them in on each enemy's weakness, each perk's strength and what not to shoot. 
I showed them how important it is to run away, how you can run through enemies if there are no clots, how important it is to stand still when small enemies attack you so that teammates can shoot them and the medic can heal you.
They learned that if you share the cash around to those who need it the whole team can survive easier and they started to understand that some classes need ammo boxes more than others.
They learned how to be a team. 

During that entire map there were only 2 deaths up until the patriarch. 
At the start of wave 8 I had to answer the door bell and when I came back the team had butchered the last scrake with disciplined volleys of shotgun fire. 

The patriarch still killed everyone but me (a lucky rocket took out 3) and I had to carry but then my deceased team mates would call out his location instead of being silent. They were all typing encouragement and watching how I evaded him - not bad for a team who didn't even speak once on the previous map.

I was so happy and proud of these new players that I played another map with them (Hospital Horrors) and this time we beat the patriarch with no casualties - the first time any of them had lived through the pat (pipebomb piles in a corridor ftw!).

Now, I am not saying that they went from zeroes to heroes in one giant leap (there were still some silly deaths and newby mistakes) but everyone's experience in the game markably improved. 

I am seeing many posts here on r/KF about how uncooperative players are on normal, and how the player base is getting more and more populated by griefers and non team players, but few about how it is *our* responsibility as experienced players to help them play the game by going on there and teaching them. 
It is not enough just to post links to a tutorial forum post - only ~1400 people who subscribe to this subreddit will ever see it.

To a new player, hard seems like such an unsurmountable challenge that they might never encounter many of the great players (and mentors) that I have had the pleasure to have learned from. Some might stop playing altogether.

So, Level 6 players, get off your hard, suicidal and Hell on Earth servers once in a while and show them why Killing Floor is such an exciting, stimulating and social game.

Go make me proud, readers.

**tl;dr** more experienced players need to play on normal difficulty servers and help the new guys once in a while.

1363782341.0	1anq81	[PSA] If a Scrake attacks you, stand STILL. 	shaosam	74	3	21	"So shit has hit the fan and a raged scrake lunges at you. You back away and give him a quick panicked burst to the head with whatever weapon you have on hand. However he is still alive and manages to actually start damaging you. AT THIS POINT STOP immediately and entirely, for several reasons:

1. Continuing to back away will cause the scrake to use his most damaging attack, his lunging swipe with his chainsaw arm. This is an almost guaranteed way to get yourself and possibly other teammates killed quickly. Stand perfectly still and he will use his stationary attack, which is far less damaging. 

2. Staying still means the scrake will also stand still while he attacks you, making it easier for your teammates to hit/headshot the stationary scrake.   

3. Staying still makes it easier for your team to heal you while you tank the damage. 

So stop moving and focus the scrake with whatever you have, or if you are really close to dying try to heal yourself and hope your team takes care of him. Remember, it's ok (and adviseable) to back away when the scrake is in the process of running at you, but once he has closed the distance and actually attacks, STOP. "	t5_2rf65	True

Thank you for, even years later, doing regular updates, bugfixes, and DLC, and supporting the community. Thanks for creating a game that entirely encourages teamwork. 

And r/KF, thanks for being encouraging and friendly. Without your help, I would still be raging FPs left and right, slapping scrakes and running like a bitch, and completely ignoring the berzerker class :) I'd also probably be one of the surly rude players that gets mad because I'm not getting any kills and dying(hopefully not, though :))

This is the only game that I've literally bought 10 copies of to give to friends, all of whom have gone on to buy it for other friends. You did it right, you're still doing it right, and I appreciate it.

So, yeah...thanks!

SIGNUPS are **CLOSED**. An announcement will be made on Thursday, March 8.

How about a friendly Killing Floor tournament! **All calibers of players are welcome (don't be scared off because you just got it or don't feel very good!)** and the prize, currently, is cosmetic I'm thinking, with perhaps admin access to my server for a month or so. Let's encourage strategy oriented play and make some Steam friends! We'll be competing across **all difficulties** except beginner, with a victor team in each bracket. The dates will be worked around the schedules of the players involved - we'll make it work!

Teams consist of 6 players, one player per class, with no class swapping until the Patriarch wave. During the Patriarch wave, class limits are increased to 4 per class with the exception of Berserker, which is still at 1.

A mutator will be used to equalize class levels: Normal = 3, Hard = 4, Suicidal = 5, and Hell on Earth = 6... so your class level doesn't really matter. Experience is what counts. The maximum amount of hours played to qualify for each bracket is: Normal &lt; 80, Hard &lt; 175, Suicidal &lt; 300, Hell on Earth &lt; Infinity.

Exploits will result in disqualification. Points will be awarded to teams based on how many waves were completed, whether or not the Patriarch was defeated, and assigned bonus points subject to my discretion (typically amazing clutches or heroics, or particularly genius strategies). Map assignments will be even and chosen randomly from the given pools, each team playing three rounds (round 1 having two maps played, the highest score from both maps being used).

Winning is as a team, not as an individual player. Ties will be broken by a random selection of one of the following scenarios: if applicable, difficulty is increased and you play a medium length game; same map but Fakedplayers mutator is used to spawn 10 player's worth of zombies; Hellfire mutator; or other various nasty modes. Tiebreakers will be used if teams have &lt;30 difference in points. &gt;:)

If you don't have a team, **I'll be matchmaking** with the results from your signup, so don't sweat! If you have people you want on a team, talk with them, pick a captain, and sign up together! If you don't have enough members you want to form the full 6-man team, matchmaking will assign you players with the roles you need. Don't be afraid to message me about anything!  
  
**ALL TEAM MEMBERS NEED TO SIGN UP. REFERENCING EACH OTHER IS NECESSARY, BUT YOU MUST ALL SIGN UP INDIVIDUALLY AS WELL.** If you are the Team Captain and your members don't want to do the form, you may do it for them - just be sure the information is accurate.
  
SIGNUPS are **CLOSED**. An announcement will be made on Thursday, March 8.
  
**PRIZE UPDATE:** zYnthetic has offered download keys to the winning teams for [SOUNDTRACK FOR THE APOCALYPSE](http://zynthetic.bandcamp.com/album/soundtrack-for-the-apocalypse), the album with the great Killing Floor songs and more goodies. I love this album, I bought it maybe half a year ago or so and I listen to it in my car all the time. :)

Every other game I play has a reddit server. /r/tf2 has their server and mumble, where people hang out and play; /r/chivalrygame has a chivalry medieval warfare server and mumble server where again, people hang out and have fun. /r/warthunder is probably the best example of this. They have events every few days on their mumble server, and have generated a very tightly knit community because of it. I think we should do the same. 

Our community is small, so I think we would only need 1 server. It would run on community donations, and come with a 15 slot mumble server to boot. 

I sort of tried this with my ""reddit kf mumble"" idea, but don't know how it went because the server subscription ran out and I was in Arizona without any Internet for the weeks that it existed. 

I could set up the server, probably based in Chicago so that people across the US would have decent pings. I've run servers before, so that shouldn't be an issue. 

We could have /r/killingfloor admins (if they wanted) as admins as well as me and a few other common subreddit contributors. 

If it works, maybe the server could go in the sidebar, and would actually succeed at making the community closer and making the game a lot more fun for everyone.

1340178064.0	vbij0	A note on teamplay, for newbies and pros alike	TjPshine	48	9	40	"Hey guys, Zed Killers and Syringe Pumpers alike.  
I've had Killing Floor for a long time now, almost since it came out, and there are a few things that I've always wanted to tell fellow players, but I've never really had the place to do it.  
Now, I know there are only 1700 of us (only is such a relative term) here, but I think any player that can take what I say here and use it is a boon to the community.    

I hope what I'm going to say here doesn't come off as either pretentious or angry, but merely helpful advice on playing as a team.    

**Defending a specific area**  
This kind of ties in to what I'm going to say later about each perk, but it's important, so bear with me.  
When you are playing a map and camping a specific area, you need to have clear roles as to who is watching what.  
(Pretend we're in the tunnel in West London, I'm going to assume a lot of you have played that map)  
The tunnel has two sides, and it's important to know who is watching what.  
I just played a match earlier today where the people were going back and forth, just trying to get as many kills as they can, shooting at both sides of the tunnel.  
Now, this destroys your defense, because what happens is that everyone goes to one side of the tunnel, shoots things, then to the other side, shoots things, etc.  
This leaves a huge gap when no one is watching one side of the tunnel, and then it can become swamped with sirens, husks, you name it.  
If you have a team, split it up equally, 2 at the front, 2 at the back. Maybe a medic in the middle healing both.  
*Sure, some people may not get as many kills, but this ensures that there is never a hole in your defense*.    

Now, perk roles.  
I'm sure you're all thinking, *oh, I know what to do with my perk,* and, *Other people need to learn what to do, not me*, but maybe this message isn't for you.  
Again, this is just a helpful note, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone here knew this.    

**Beserker**  
Pretty obvious. Kill things.  
Clots and Gorefasts are your main enemies, as you can take them out easily, and at little risk.  
Sirens and Husks are also great for you, however it can be dangerous for you to approach them, so be wary.  
On easier difficulties, you should have no issues dealing with scrakes, and because you take less damage, you should be willing to step in front of a fleshpound mauling a teammate.  
When defending an area (rather than kiting), it is important to keep some distance behind you, that way you can maintain a forward backward movement, which will allow you to avoid attacks from gorefasts and the like.  
You're fast, use it to your advantage.
*watch out for crawlers, they are your worst enemy. A lever action rifle can help with this.*    

**Commando**  
A great perk, and often underlooked. As a commando, people might give you hell for not actually doing anything for the team. Ignore them, you're doing the most for it.  
Along with the beserker, you should focus your fire on clots and gorefasts, as they easily fall victim to your fire.  
That being said, I would say that the commando's biggest goal on a team is to kill crawlers and stalkers.  
Both of these zeds have an easy time creeping up on and killing beserkers and sharpshooters caught unaware, but as a commando you should always be looking for them first.  
Your ability to kill crawlers is your largest asset to the team, and in the face of a scrake you need to be able to make sure that the sharpshooter can still aim.  
While you can waste a whole mag on scrakes, it is advised that you do not attack the larger enemies, rather calling them out to teammates with bigger guns.  
You can also pick off bloats, helping out unsuspecting beserkers.  
Commandos are good partners with demomolitions, as they can see health bars through the smoke, and demos take out all the larger enemies commandos hate.    

**Field Medic**  
There's not much to say here. Carrying both mediguns allows you to easily have a never ending stream of needles at higher levels, and they aren't bad guns.  
Keep an eye out for crawlers, as it is not only your duty to heal, but to prevent damage as well.  
You can consider carrying an xbow, lever action rifle, or axe to aid you.  
Remember, you're one of the few perks that can throw a grenade at your feet to get out of a cluster of enemies safely.  
In a defending situation you should move back and forth between battle zones, making sure everyone is healed, and focus less on kills.    

**Firebug**  
An interesting, and mostly hated, perk.  
You can adequately whittle away at smaller classes, one puff of flame and they'll die soon enough.  
When you are with a heavier class (sharp, beserker, support), do not burn the scrakes. This will mess up their aggro, which will make it harder for supports, or break a stunlock that may have been established.  
*you are a useful perk, no matter what anyone tells you, but you must learn how to stay out of the way in certain moments*    

**Sharpshooter**  
A class that I started with, as I'm sure many of you did as well.  
Try and pair up with a commando, medic, or firebug who can easily take out crawlers, and focus your fire on the big things.  
It's ok to have a lower kill count, you're the one taking out the 1 in 20 fleshpounds and scrakes.  
*A large focus will be on husks and sirens as they approach, who can cause lots of damage to a team.*  
Sharpshooter is a great perk, however your greatest challenge will be to decide when to not play sharpshooter. There are a lot of us out there, and so we must forget our pride and switch perk if there are a few other sharpshooters on the team.  
Try to agree with the demoman on focusing fires on different areas, as he blocks your view fairly efficiently. Be nice.    

**Support Specialist**  
A brilliant class.  
The role of either making sure nothing sneaks up on your team with an incredible welding ability, or blasting through a crowd of enemies with shell after shell from your shotguns.  
While there is nothing largely for a support to focus on, you must do what your name suggests, and support.  
If a commando is being bogged down, walk in and blast everything away. The same goes for zerkers and sharps. They may be angry for you taking their kills, but it's not about the scoreboard all the time, and if they need money toss them some.    
That being said, you can take out scrakes and fleshpounds with relative ease, especially the former, and so you should remember that if a teammate is in need of dire help.  
Remember to crouch so you can hit crawlers, but gorefasts usually need to be hit higher up.  
High five.    

**Demolitions**  
You have a large damage output, but you can be destroyed at close range. The new demo rifle brought change to that, but it isn't a great alternative to the m79, and certainly not the m32.  
You should try and focus on large enemies, however if there is a cluster of smaller enemies you can take them as well.  
Try to avoid blocking the views of sharpshooters, and please, oh please, heed this next note:  
*If an ally, such as a zerker or support, is near a fleshpound or scrake, do not bombard it unless you know you can kill it*.  
When you don't kill it, your teammate is left in a cloud of smoke, and a very angry zed could come out of nowhere and destroy him.  
Now, that is very critical of demos, but you are a strong class, you just, like pyro, need to make sure that you are accommodating for the other people on your team.    


**tl;dr:** Remember to play what your perks strengths are, do not fight for the scoreboard. Also, when defending, do not leave gaps, and everyone play zones, not man to man.    


Again, I hope this doesn't seem to wide blown or cocky, and I hope I've helped you all out here.

Not only did he *1337 h4x* his way to god-tier player, but he used the Steam Achievement Manager (hack to give you all achievements/level 6 perks) and got **the holiday skins.** Whenever I would see a player with an unlockable skin I instantly respected them for pushing the extra mile to unlock it, especially the Mr. Foster skin, because it was the hardest to get out of them all. Hell, I was fucking proud of myself and wore that skin with pride! But now I just feel sick that when I see a player with it, because for all I know, they took the shortcut up the mountain and claimed the prize for taking the long route others did.

It's just sad, y'know?

1347399058.0	zqb0n	Advanced Tactic: Siren Scream Cancelling	Fine_Cut	38	1	10	"This is unfortunately a lesser known tactic, but it can and will save your life a few times or make a few sirens a little less of an ear-ache for you.

The idea is to shoot, melee, etc., the siren just as her head goes down to scream (does not need to be a head shot), then **WAIT** until her head goes back up - during this time you can shoot her all you want (it's a tiny window of opportunity but it should be all you need in most cases), and you can continue cancelling by shooting again just before she dips her head.

It is important to **STOP** shooting once her head dips. Not doing so will cancel your cancel, so to speak, and ruin the whole thing. This is often seen when canceling, a 'helpful' teammate will try to 'save' you from the siren, negating your cancel, and causing you to take damage from a full scream or that awful 'after death' scream the siren is famous for.

This is also a great way to avoid the shitty siren hitbox. When her head is down, the hitbox is dodgy as fuck. When it is up, it's always right on her head. This lets you do things like 9mm the siren as her head dips, and as it goes back up, pop off 2 m14 shots for the kill - or whatever tickles your fancy. It's also great for support: 9mm cancel as your moving towards it, when in range and immediately after a cancel, blast away with the hunting shotgun.

*note: This does not work in solo mode, only on a listen or dedicated server*

TheIronSponge	36	5	24	"So, I was playing a game by myself on a public, West London only server on Normal just winding down and working on getting my Sharpshooter to level 6. I had just finished wave 5/10 and restocking ammo and armor at the trader in the church when a level 6 medic named Gummo joined. 

As I walked out of the trader getting ready to dump some money for him, he started welding one of the doors to the church while I was still inside. I went out the other door and started helping him weld his door. After that door, he started welding the other door and, naturally, I decided to give him a hand. 

Smallish stuff started spawning and I noticed he had his knife out and was kiting them towards me. Now, I had a Mk23 and XBow and have gotten somewhat good at quick headshots so I could take out pretty much anything on Normal with two players easily enough. Once we had about 15 specimens left, I headed over to the trader. Noticing this, Gummo ran ahead and blocked the door. Trying not to let it get to me, I finished off the last of the specimens and thought to myself ""Two can play at this game."" 

So, I switched to my level 6 Medic, dropped him my Mk23 and XBow and ran off to find armor. Then, wave 7 began and he started following me around the map. I said to him in the chat ""lol were both so fast :D"". On my way around, I made sure to avoid narrow passages and stick to the street area as well as run him directly through every siren I found. After about 10 laps around the map, he left the server. And after all that, I finished my game like a boss. True story.

So I'm curious, how do you guys/gals usually handle trolls?"	t5_2rf65	True

I've been playing a lot lately. So far i had encounter only good teams, people that support each other and give money to the ones that just joined or died in the last round, people who strategize and are POLITE.

But this last few games i've had to deal with very, VERY annoying people and i can't but wonder why would someone do this kind of stuff?

- throw grenades to other players (on purpose, because they aren't around of any zed so they can't possibly say it was to save him from the horde)
- weld doors in the way of the trader so people have to unweld it and waste a lot of time.
- STAY IN THE DOOR OF THE TRADER SO NOBODY CAN GET INSIDE, OMG WHY?! (yesterday someone actually said ""i'll just stay in here and you'll have to say 'please' in order to get inside, say 'please', c'mon, say it!"")
- Steal a kill from a berzerker JUST BEFORE HE/SHE GET HIS/HER KILL, seriously, i've been playing berzerker and this has happened a lot of times, happened a lot in a team that had one guy who did practicly all of this things. Also, if you're not Commando and there's a commando in the team, please avoid killing the stalkers, THEY MEAN A LOT TO THIS PERK AND IT'S ONE VERY HARD TO LEVEL UP.
- brag about their performance (specially when they don't have the most kills and, well, because is a cooperative game, not a goddamn competition). Don't get me wrong. it's nice looking at the chart and see that you've had a good game, but to brag about it? that's just lame.


please, please, don't do that. killing floor is so much fun and so far it doesn't seem to have that awful athmosphere that i've seen in other games like it. (at least to me)

I ALWAYS play with my friends. Only rarely do I play in a Public game. Recently one of my friends that I play with discovered some sort of cheat which gives him the ability to level up all of his Perks. When he told me this, I was incredibly disappointed in him. Being that he's somewhat new to the game, I'd always give him tips, give him money and overall save his bacon whenever he was in danger. 

I've tried to explain to him that despite being a Level 6, he still doesn't know the ""trick of the trade"" to the game and that he still has very little experience with using the correct guns and using his the Perks benefits correctly. (he buys guns which don't suit the perk).

He pretty much ignored me and told my other friends about the cheat software. As I expected, my other friend got the cheating software too. To this day, I only have one friend in our little KF group that has never cheated. 

So after my one friend had leveled up his perks, we played together on Biotics Lab (Normal/Long). I kid you not, he died in the second wave and rage quit after I said in our Skype chat ""See what I mean?"".

It's been a few days since we last talked and now he's boasting about how him and my other friend (the one that cheated too) are so pro. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139620277

_

So I'm here to ask if there is any kind of way that I can tell him to change back to his original levels? I just can't play with him knowing he's taken the easy route while me and my other friend have worked hard to get where we are.

Upon starting, used the 9mm to fill as many clots as possible full of lead as fast as I could click. I almost lived a full minute.

There was no crosshair, each zombie seemed to take way too many shots to take down relative to how many bullets I had in my gun. Me and my friend, fps veterans, were not about to take the ego blow of playing on beginner, no sir, we decided to give normal a couple more shots. We almost made it to wave 2 once. About 45 minutes in, I had had enough. I declared this game a load of impossible horseshit. It sat stagnant in my steam inventory for a few months until one bored rainy day I decided to give it another honest shot on some public servers. Maybe the key to surviving that first wave was having more people around to watch your back. 

I joined a map that was on wave 10 - an impossible feat for me. ""These guys must be pretty pro"", I thought. I was wrong, I died about 20 seconds into the wave on some stairs by 2 giant guys in metal underpants that shrugged off my 9mm shots like spitballs. It didnt take long for the rest of the team to wipe either, reaffirming my belief that this game was the hardest zombie survival game ever made. The next map was the one I remember the best. 

It was my return to the manor, this time upon spawning, I noticed one of the players had a golden commando icon beside his name. I was informed this meant he was level 6, the top level. I was impressed. I actually survived until wave 4, but mostly due to my teams expertise. I didn't trust myself to stray too far from them but eventually I was overtaken by a surprise group of gorefasts and died in what seemed like an instant. I sat there cursing the game and decided to watch this level 6 guy play. He was a master. He never got caught off guard while reloading. He killed the specimens with precise shots, never spraying into a crowd. He never even stopped moving to aim. This guy finished each wave out - the rest of the team would wipe. Watching him was eye opening. A game I had declared impossible was being played by one guy who seemed to have an answer for everything. Never getting cornered, running out of ammo, or being surprised by anything. 

It changed the way I looked at the game. Instead of being impossible, this was now something I was just doing wrong. This one match made me realize that I just needed to adapt and improve or be killed off 2 minutes into eave wave. This game set out a challenge for me, and I was hooked. Eventually I learned that taking that extra second to line up the head shot was more efficient than unloading 5 body shots in the same time frame. Incidentally, I wouldn't run out of ammo. Eventually I learned that taking out the red guys with blade arms was more important than the slower clots. I began surviving waves, and having money to spend. I was able to afford the bullpup. I was progressing in perk levels. I played mostly on west london and biotics lab. I still got surrounded quite easily on farm as the team liked to move around a lot, the offices were confusing and the monsters seemed to come from everywhere. I compelled myself to stick with it.

Eventually after many grinds of the basic maps, I had that golden commando icon next to my name. I knew the maps inside and out. I knew how to handle each specimen - what ones I could take down with a headshot and which ones I had to be more careful with. I could finish out a wave if my team died. I had become the level 6 pro. I felt like a killing floor god, invincible. I had figured out the game. I moved on to the sharpshooter perk, which I leveled up significantly faster than commando. I attributed this to me just being better, and sharpshooter felt even more invincible at level 6. I could take down EVERYTHING with some well placed shots. The only thing I felt ever had a chance at killing me was the patriarch. I even leveled up a few more perks. I was the killing floor king.

Then the Halloween event started. One of the new achievements  to unlock the commando chicken was ""Beat a long match on Bedlam on hard"".

I really wanted that fucking commando chicken. I knew I had once thought normal impossible, I had since became a 'master', but that didn't mean I thought it was easy, I just thought I was good.

I joined a bedlam match on hard. I died the 2nd wave. I couldn't believe it. The zeds... they moved so much faster. They were overtaking me before I could line up all the head shots. It took quite a few more attempts. We had 2 guys from a clan join and tell us to hold the hallway near the spawn. We made it to wave 10. I had been commando, the perk I felt I had the most mastery of and would be able to contribute with the most on this difficulty. We got to the patriarch and I was introduced to the chainsaw circle strategy. I had no idea if it would work or not, it sounded fishy, but I did as the two clan players instructed and we disposed of him very quickly. I had that commando chicken. I felt accomplished. My e-peen grew three sizes that day.

But I had enough of hard. It had lived up to its moniker - it WAS hard. I made it my goal to get every perk up to level 6. I did this on normal difficulty. It took a long time. Long enough that by the time I got my last perk, beserker, to level 6. I knew every map inside and out. how many shots took down each specimen. How to get head shots straight from the hip, consistently. Not to shoot scrakes or fleshpounds unless you are going to kill them. Not to put pipes behind welded doors for the patriarch. Little things here and there, little tidbits of knowledge and skill that only come from playing the game. Many hours in, I had every perk to level 6. The game I once deemed an impossible pile of horseshit was now laughably easy. Now what? 

Most people would say 'well now you go on to hard, and conquer that, and then suicidal, and then hell on earth'.

I reset my perks back to 0 with some clever file editing to do it all again. I wanted to feel that feeling of desperation again, just clinging on to winning by a hair.

But it wasn't happening. Even with my perks at level 0, I was still dominating. The game was still laughably easy. I knew where to be. I knew where to shoot. I knew what to shoot. I knew what to buy, and when to buy it. The game as a level 0 was not significantly more of a challenge than it was when I was level 6. 

I decided to jump to hard. My last foray into hard had been a while ago at this point and now hard did not seem as daunting as it was when I first tried. Even as a level 0, it wasn't impossible, but it was a challenge. I had gotten better at lining up those headshots, I wasn't nervously looking around. I was making calculated shots. Looking where I knew zombies would spawn from. Holding locations I knew to be safe. Playing perks to compensate for my teams weaknesses. It's not your perk level that makes you good at killing floor, it's your mastery of the mechanics.

I had beaten every map on hard. Next I started with suicidal. The jump from hard to suicidal is harder than the jump from suicidal to hell on earth.

Scrakes no longer are instantly decapped or flinch locked with the katana. Fleshpounds have headshot resistances. You don't even come close to out running crawlers, stalkers, or charging gorefasts. The game becomes much less forgiving. You're forced to tighten up your mechanics. You have less time to line up that headshot, that pipe bomb better be out of sirens range, you won't have time to reload when those gorefasts start charging. Sure, strategy and load out were important, it was important before. The challenge now was being able to utilize it all as effectively as possible. It was only a matter of time before I had completed every map on not only suicidal, but hell on earth as well.

And what now? Has the game been beaten?

Not even close.

The curse of challenging yourself to become better is that you become more aware of where your weaknesses are, and I still have many things to improve on.

I still like to see how viable the claymore is on certain maps for the beserker - is it useful for camping with. What other weapons are the best to carry with it.

The husk gun can stun scrakes.. is there a spot on any map and perk combination where this could be the best way to use it? (The answer is yes)

The combinations and ideas are limited to your own creativity.

So what is there to take away from this long winded rant? I'd say that there is more to this game than appears on the surface as long as you set yourself to the challenge. Have fun exploring those maps. Discovering those kiting routes and safe camp areas. If you find yourself not being challenged, up the difficulty. Disregard your perk level - it takes longer to learn how to play each perk properly than it does to get them to level 6. You will learn the little tidbits of strategy along the way out of necessity and observation, as long as you're open to it. And last but not least, enjoy yourself.

Earlier today I was playing Killing Floor with my friend and some other random players. We were on wave 9 with suicidal difficulty on map kf-bioticslab. 

I was a berserker and I eventually died, dropping my gold katana near spawn. Before the wave completed, a SS asked the team for money so he could buy xbow/ammo. I told him that I can give him most of my money ($900) if I could pick up my katana back on new wave, because I didn't really need to buy anything else. Wave 9 ended, we spawned, that SS picked my katana up first and walked away, I told him that katana was mine and asked him if he could drop it for me. He was like *hell no* and sold it. I was about to share with him almost all of my money if I got my katana back! 

Wave started, I didn't manage to buy anything due to cash shortage, I only had a knife and pistol. I raged, gave my friend all of my money and went to suicide. Friend called the team retarded and left. The whole team wiped out 5 seconds later."	t5_2rf65	True

I wanted to do something fun here on /r/killingfloor to spur a little more activity, so I was thinking that I would sponsor a mini contest.

Here's the rules:

* Enter by replying to this thread with an unmodified Killing Floor screenshot on the new Hellride map.  Unmodified means no photoshopping or adding meme text. There is no theme -- the screenshot can be funny or scary or whatever.
* The image must be hosted via Steam's upload feature, on Steam's servers.
* The community will decide who wins -- the most upvoted screenshot as of Sunday night PST (whenever I get around to it on July 15) will be the winner.  I will be using RES to only count upvotes, so don't bother downvoting other entries.
* No more than 2 submissions per user, please.
* In the event of a tie, I will arbitrarily pick one entry as the winner.
* And, most importantly, I will gift the winner one of the $2 DLC character packs.  I will contact the winner via PM on Reddit for their Steam ID and their DLC choice.

**TL;DR**: There were only 6 bullet points.  Read them.

I will make a comment on this thread for questions - please reply to that comment so that other top-level comments can be just submissions.

**Update 1** (July 11): 

* It has been arbitrarily decided that there is a 2-submission limit. Reddit user [entireties](http://www.reddit.com/user/entireties) made 3 submissions but is being grandfathered in. 
* [Jorgamun will also be making special flair for the contest winner](http://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/waeca/unofficial_rkillingfloor_contest_hellride/c5bnhah), and you may have also noticed that he added the banner in the top indicating this contest.  
* Reddit user [Amorii](http://www.reddit.com/user/AMorrii) ([Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/AMorrii/)) has contacted me via PM and has offered to supply another $2 DLC pack for the runner-up in this contest.

1366238411.0	1ckdff	What would you like to see in (a hypothetical) Killing Floor 2?	Ihmhi	24	5	59	"Here's my (short) list:

&amp;nbsp;

**Players cannot block the Trader door:**

When the Anti-blocker mutator is on practically *every server*, it probably should be built into the core functionality of your game. It baffles me how Tripwire would pick up the enhanced scoreboard and the Zed kill counter, but not what is probably the most important community-made mutator of all.

&amp;nbsp;

**Others cannot pick up your dropped weapons:**

If you die and drop a weapon, other people might pick it up. Sometimes they keep it or sell it. General KF etiquette is to return it to the player if you pick it up  - unless they leave or say it's okay, and then it's fair game.

So, in KF2 I'd like to make sure that your weapons cannot be picked up by anyone other than you. If you drop it and then you leave the server, then it's a free-for-all.

&amp;nbsp;

**Make tossing weapons to players (or on the ground) more intuitive, and prevent theft of mis-thrown weapons:**

Put your crosshair over a player and tap the ""Throw Weapon"" key. So long as they are close enough, you'll ""throw"" your weapon to that player. If they cannot carry it, it automatically bounces back to you. If you want to just drop a weapon, look at anything other than a player and hold the ""Drop weapon"" key.

As for money, have it work as it does now - but add in the functionality above. If you have a player in your crosshair and *hold* the Throw Money button, you throw money to that player that cannot be intercepted by someone else. This is to prevent the annoying practice of people jumping in front of you when you're throwing a lot of money to someone else.

&amp;nbsp;

**Don't use optics to balance the game:**

This might be a bit controversial, but I think that Tripwire uses optics of weapons to balance the game and I'm not too fond of that. Some of the guns have shitty sights. I'd use the M14 EBR more often if it weren't for the terrible iron sights.

You already have a perk-levelling system in the game. Just give us Call of Duty/Battlefield style upgrades for the guns where we can put on whichever custom optics we'd like to. Standard iron sights, red-dot, and 4x (ACOG) would be fine. Perhaps the pistols could have an additional option for [tritium sights](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Handgun_Tritium_Night_Sights.png) (like what's on the MK23), and grenade launchers could have an option for special grenade-launcher sights.

&amp;nbsp;

**Balance the starting gear on cost:**

If you want to sell *all* of your starting gear, we all already know the trick. Spawn as Sharpshooter. Play Wave 1. Sell your crossbow, suicide, respawn. Pick up your second pistol, sell that and your second crossbow, and *then* change to the appropriate perk and buy stuff with all of your dosh.

This can be solved in two easy steps.

First, make sure all starting gear is equivalent in cost. ""Spawn"" weapons (those you get at Level 5 and 6) are already balanced at a lower sell cost. Newer players might not know this, but Berserker used to be the go-to class for selling your spawn weapon because the Chainsaw sold for a ridiculous amount of money.

Given that the Crossbow sells for £600, all Level 6 weapons should sell for £600.

But what about the armor?

Screw it, make it so you can sell armor as well. Get £200 pound for 100% armor, and reduce the sale price by £2/1% in the event of damage. Then for the classes where you spawn with armor, balance it so you can sell the spawn weapon + armor for £600. (For Medic, maybe make the Armor worth £50 at 100% since Medic gets a discount on armor.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Give us more cosmetic options - specifically, on weapons:**

The Golden Weapons pack is 100% superficial and cosmetic just like all Tripwire DLC - with the exception of the community weapons pack. I don't 100% agree with how they handled the community weapons pack, but I still respect Tripwire for committing to *not* selling any DLC that's going to heavily change the game.

Give us options for guns that are just cosmetic so we can customize things more. Give us a camo option. Give us a ""wrapped in rags and duct-tape"" option. Give us a ""battle-damaged"" option. Just simple skinning and bump-mapping that looks a bit different so we can stand out from the other guy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Voices, man. Voices.:**

I get that recording people is expensive, but the one department of Killing Floor that hasn't survived long-term is the voices. With the exception of Ash (who got a female voice), *everyone* has the same male voice.

I understand it takes a fair bit of work to get someone in the studio to record. I'd say it's less work than a modeller making a quality character model + skin, but that's still dependent on a unique person that you may have to contract out to.

I'd like to see the individual starting characters each have their own voice, and I'd like to see new voices ship with character skins. I'd pay an extra dollar or two just for the variety in characterization.

Alternatively, I'd be fine with having something in the style of TRIBES or Saints Row where you can pick your voice from a drop-down menu (Male 1, Male 2, Male 3, Female 1, Female 2, Female 3). Premium voice packs can come out after the fact.

I mean honestly, if they added an option for 2-4 new voices to the game right now... who here *wouldn't* buy it?

&amp;nbsp;

**Add an option for saving load-outs:**

At some point, you're in the groove. You have all of your perks to Level 6. You've fired every gun in the game. You know what you like and you buy it every time.

Give us an option to buy ""Loadouts"". It would simply be a saved list of your favorite guns (with absolutely no limit as to how many you can save, since arbitrary limits are ridiculous).

Here's an example: As Support, my go-to- Patriarch loadout is Trenchgun, AA12, and M79. So I could create a loadout named ""Support Patriarch"" and it would be under a new tab in the trader window. The cost would be the total of those three weapons (which would properly factor in the discounts - in this case I'd get a discounted AA12 as Support) and I would automatically buy all three instead of having to scroll through the long list to get off-perk weapons.

&amp;nbsp;

**Gunslinger Perk:**

All of the perks stand out pretty well right now. They all have their niches. People have been asking for a gunslinger perk - a handguns expert - for a long time right now.

I don't really have an incredibly compelling game balance reason to explain this. Sure, the Sharpshooter has a hell of a lot of weapons (3 handguns and 4 sniper rifles), but I'd like to see Gunslinger made into its own perk.

Sit down, watch a couple of John Woo movies that are starring Chow Yun Fat, and then figure out how to make it work. I wanna dive through the air firing twin pistols while doves are flying behind me. (Doves are optional.)

&amp;nbsp;

Well, that's the lot for me. I love Killing Floor. I've probably bought 20 copies of this game over the years and handed it out to friends because I love it so much and I love supporting a dev that treats the community right.

The biggest complaint I've heard about Killing Floor from friends who I've recently introduced the game to is that it's very dated graphically. I'm seriously hoping that Tripwire is looking into licensing the Unreal 4 engine and we're going to get a newer, more modern version of Killing Floor that keeps the same awesome and addictive gameplay and improves on the stuff that we've come to love.

Please add in your ideas and, of course, discuss mine. I'd really like to see what you guys think should be in the next generation of Killing Floor."	t5_2rf65	True

For example, kiting is fairly easy, you can just jump over ZEDs 90% of the time. Admittedly, miss-timing or poorly aiming a jump will result in you slowly floating down to your death, which kinda balances out.

Also, using the shotgun/law while in the air to ""rocket jump"" around is tons o' fun. Everything about it just makes it more fun to run around the map, while making it kinda easier to survive. which would be epic...if the map was a bit more open. LAW-jumping up foundry or using the shotgun to long-jump across the gaps in aperture or santa's lair would definitely make for a great time (as a non-serious gamemode/map)

Months later there was ""free weekend"". I installed it, played. It was fun, but I didn't bought it. I still remember how it bugged my mind. It wasn't THAT great, but still, there was that something.

Summer came (Can't remember was it actually summer or winter...). Killing Floor has its discount. I finally bought it. If I remember right, there was still those 5 core maps, nothing else. Not even AA-12 or any ""Tier 3"" weapons, except the L.A.W. Many bug and glitch fixes had been made. I started leveling up. Update after update, character pack after character pack and pre-order bonus after pre-orderbonus (The Ball) I bought EVERYTHING! Eve-ryt-h-ngh! Soon I noticed I've been playing KF more often than L4D. Even L4D2 hasn't its chance against KF!

Now, today, my collection is full. I haven't completed every achievement yet, but I believe I can do it someday. Over 300h clocked playtime, all perks maxed, two even overmaxed.

I'm not that active player anymore as I used to be. I don't take this game as seriously anymore as I used to take. Still, I enjoy playing it. New players are fun to watch as they strugle and spam constantly ""Give me monnnyyy!""

If a group of zeds is approaching with a stalker or two at the head, and you have a gun (or several) to reload, rush the stalker rather than running away or killing it with any remaining shots. It will stop moving to attack you, at which point you can kite back, dodging the strike. Upon missing, it will charge you again, and you can repeat the process without taking damage.

The Zed Density Control Mutator is a mutator that allows you to alter how many specimens be out at the same time. It also can reduce the time between spawns at the ZombieVolumes.  With the right adjustments it can become quite overwhelming. These screenshots were taken with the values of 200 zeds at same time and 0 sec spawn time along with FakedPlayers mutator to insure that more zed spawn is possible. Unfortunately my computer can not handle such a volume of Zeds making the gameplay impossible, It was chugging along at ~4fps for a 2007 era laptop.

1363267139.0	1aa6c7	What is the deal?		21	3	44	"I am fairly new to killing floor compared to a lot of people. I think I have like 40 hours or so in. I really enjoy the difficulty of the game and the strategy, but I am having a real hard time making the jump from normal to hard. 

All the people I'm playing with don't seem to understand the concept of strategy. In normal mode, this is fine, everybody can run around and for the most part be ok. Still it's better if we stick together, but whatever. It's normal mode.

But then I get to hard mode, and people are still doing the exact same thing. There are these level 6 people, who I would think if they have put enough time into the game, they should know the concepts of strategy, like not raging a flesh pound and such. But no. People are still splitting up, running around trying to be a solo badass, then die one by one, and inevitably I am usually the last one running around with like ~100 or so zed, and then I usually die as well.

So I guess what I am saying is how do you guys find good games?

I mean, I try and converse with the people (I have a mic), but usually it works out about like this:

Me: Hey guys, lets stick together and hold this choke point.

One of them: No, fuck off. (Then dies)

The End.

In early August, me and a friend were playing KF talking to each other about what this game REALLY needs. And we went on until we decided that this game needs some good WWII hardware. So we're like ""Fuck, it'd be awesome if Trip Int. added some badass German or Russian weapons. That'd be dope"" And we both went on and joked about how if we sounded convincing enough, Tripwire would add a legit awesome C96 or STG44. So I said ""Lol, hey Herman, lets send em an email"" And we both agreed that it was worth a shot. So I typed up a fair paragraph as to why we think a WWII weapon should be added. And we waited, waited and waited. Until I said ""Dammit Herman, I just made myself look like an idiot, they probably all just laughed and joked about how stupid that email was."" Until today, BAM.

The map(s) will be chosen randomly from the pool when the round starts. All teams in the same bracket will play the same map, but you won't know which exactly it is until the match is about to start. It is advised that you don't tell any other teams' members which map you're playing.

Round 1 has unique scoring - since you play two games, you take the highest score you made of both of the maps you played. If you get a perfect score on both maps, you take a perfect score + 10 for the round. **This tournament is not based on elimination** - all teams will advance to every round, with ties coming up after all rounds of play.  
  
**Ties (point difference &lt;=30)** - your team and the teams you're tied with will each pick two of the following words:  
  Beat  
  Bruised  
  Blushed  
  Burnt  
  Broke  
  Bashed  
  Burst  
  
Intersection in choice will have you all use that tie breaker, otherwise you're randomly given them (all play the same).

1362967121.0	1a2249	State of the Firebug		18	3	5	"I submitted a post like this ages ago, kind of a few firebug questions. I want to know which weapons are ""worth it"" and which aren't. I've recorded some observations:

* *Husk:* I don't think this gun is worth the price at low levels, and isn't worth the low damage at the higher levels. This weapon probably needs buffed or discounted. Even playing on hard, this weapon simply doesn't have the damage output to take down a Scrake or Fleshpound while holding off the rest of the mobs. Its only advantage lies in its weighing 8 blocks.

* *Flame Thrower:* The firebug's headline weapon is better than people seem to give it credit for. It can easily ignite a whole crowd, and it makes you a Support's best friend at a choke-point. At a high enough level, it has good range, a lot of ammo, and reloads fast enough. Nonetheless, it doesn't have the chutzpah to burn down the bigger units, and may just enrage them. The real disadvantage, in my opinion, is that you cannot carry both the Trench *and* the Thrower.

* *Trench Gun:* I find this to be the dark horse of the Firebug arsenal. For its price, it is capable to bursting down bigger enemies (at least faster than other FB weapons), it can ignite *very* distant mobs, and you can keep yourself constantly topped off, a la Support shotgun.

* *Mac-10:* For it's size and price, it offers quite a bit. It ignites with every shot, so it can be used to quickly distribute fire. Unlike the Thrower, it can get head shots, but everything it can accomplish, the Trench can probably surpass, save for quick reloading. Its advantage over the Trench is that it can be carried with the Thrower.

* *Flare Revolver:* I initially underestimated this gun. It can quickly ignite tight groups of clots, get head shots, and you can carry a large supply of ammunition. If you're soloing, you can carry two, but, in my experience, that makes it far more difficult to land those head shots.

I nearly only solo for Killing Floor, so I am seeking the best load-out for eliminating the weaker threats, for which the Firebug is well equipped, and the stronger threats, for which the Firebug is traditionally troubled against. What load-outs do you choose?

What are your opinions about the Firebug's weapons? If you off-perk the Firebug, which weapons do you buy? How do you deal with bigger enemies? Do you feel that the Firebug is balanced, or needs edited?"	t5_2rf65	True

Now, the latest update removed the map whitelist. they've been encouraging the community to ""take over"" developing new content (see IJC packs and workshop). It seems to me that they are effectively preparing to drop KF restraints and let people ""play as they want"", whether it be getting straight to lvl 6 so the game's a bit easier, or being able to level/get achievements while using mods/custom maps. IE it's all looking very sandbox-y.

Now this could mean a few things. Maybe they are just a wee bit tired of complaints and are going ""ok then, you can run the show!"", or maybe they don't have the time or energy to keep up the support. This could be because they are working on other products, but other popular games have shown that a game can live on way past updates through mods and other custom content, this could be pretty awesome!

Or maybe they are planning a sequel. Left 4 Dead has shown games can get a sequel and don't have to lose support. Making a sequel means they can re-jig the balance, add new game play without ""breaking"" all the old stuff. they can effectively avoid making any of the mistakes of KF1 (*cough adding unbalanced weapons cough*), and try new things with a clean slate. However, if they make the same mistakes, they'll be more exaggerated. At least base KF was effectively decent, if they start with a broken game it'll go downhill fast.

Of course, dropped support can be pretty bad in a sense. unless you password servers, there's pretty much no ""protection"" from lvl 6 ""i've had this game a day"" people ruining hell on earth games, fewer un-modded server for those who want to play it normally, and generally alot more faff.

I could go on about what this change in attitude from tripwire could mean, but what do you guys reckon? anything to this? some discussion could help clear this up. I imagine this guesswork has plenty of holes."	t5_2rf65	True

It's starring the main character, who will be named, who is a consultant for Horzine and is in London during the outbreak. He escapes with DJ Scully, eventually meets up with a priest and escaped welder from a Horzine factory, and they repurpose a double decker bus to travel to the far east of Russia to get picked up and evacuated by the US military.

Hey guys, I recently picked up this amazing game last Wednesday, I have been playing it non-stop for the past week, it is such an amazing game, but today I had to go do some grocery shopping. It was dark outside, so it was either go tonight or tomorrow, I decided to go tonight, bad idea. I went outside for the first time in around a week, after nothing but Killing Floor, and so I was walking down the empty streets of my suburban neighborhood, this is when the hallucinations and paranoia kicked in. It was quiet, empty, dark, on my way to the grocery store, and I kept seeing ZEDs in my peripheral vision, scaring the shit out of me every time, I was jumpy as fuck, one time there was a parked car in my peripheral vision with light reflecting off it, I thought it was a FLESHPOUND COMING AFTER ME AHHH! Scared the shit out of me, I looked at the car and realized it was a car. During the walk I also felt kind of like I was walking in-game, like I'm holding a pistol, I finally get to the grocery store, back to civilization, and it was paradise, no more tetris effect while I was there! Then I had to walk home again, and the same haunting things happened. I finally get home, relieved that it is finally over, and what do I do? Play more Killing Floor. Now I can't sleep.

Guys, I know this is pretty crazy, but I'm a pretty paranoid person, and this is pretty scary, I need sleep, how can I get to sleep? And don't say I have to stop playing, I love my Killing Floor."	t5_2rf65	True

Hi all, there's an issue in the current live build that's causing the achievements to be incorrectly earned when completing earlier maps. To prevent this I've turned off the offending achievements, as we won't be able to fix the issue without doing a new build (the fix will come in the rollback).

I've already posted the details on another thread, so if you've seen it you can stop here, as I'm just repeating them.

The following maps have had their map-completion achievement disabled during the difficulties-Hard, Suicidal, Hell on Earth: West London, Manor, Farm, Office, Biotics Labs. Normal is still fine.

The following maps have had their map-completion achievement disabled only on Hell on Earth: Bedlam (edit: previously I called it-Asylum), Wyre, Foundry. Other difficulties should be unaffected.

My apologies if this happens to effect your achievement earning, but I'd say it's better than earning the wrong achievement. "	t5_2rf65	True

1365285737.0	1bthde	Can you give me advice on how not to piss people off on HoE? I seem to do it inadvertently.	solidus-flux	16	0	21	"***TL;DR: I've run into so many assholes online that I need to make sure it really is them and it's not just me who is the asshole.***

I leveled all my perks up to 6 on Hard. That difficulty level seems to have a lot of casual gamers, so it's pretty hard to offend people unless you're full-on griefing. I've been playing HoE lately, and I manage to piss people off regularly. I think a lot of them are oversensitive children I'll never be able to appease, but I figure it's worth talking about anyway.

**First, things I already know. It all seems pretty obvious to me but for completeness I will list some things off the top of my head.**

1. Throw new players cash, or drop a weapon if it's too late for that.
2. Heal people when you can, even if you're not a medic.
3. Help people weld, but of course don't box people in anywhere.
4. Don't block, etc.
5. If everyone's holing up and you want to kite, ask if it's okay first (I play zerk so this is relevant to me).
6. Don't rage fleshpounds or scrakes unless you have the firepower to take them down, or it's part of an agreed-upon strategy.
7. If a zerk is soloing a FP, clean up trash around him so he has room, but otherwise don't interfere unless the FP rages.
8. If you are playing demolitions, don't produce smoke when sharpshooters are set up in that area.

**Some of the problems I've run into:**

1. On wave 2 of Biotics Lab, I was a sharpshooter. I was sniping everything I could with the M14 (we were camped in the opening hallway) and got kicked by some dude named Lenny. I emailed him asking why I was banned and he said I was not being a team player, welding doors, etc. Two people already went to check the 2 doors (if you know Biotics Lab you know the 2), so I thought it was covered. No idea why he got so upset other than I was killing a lot of specimens.

2. Was playing West London solo and another guy joined. We were kiting the map clockwise but he kept hanging back to kill specimens. I suggested we advance aggressively and stay ahead of the pack (going back only when it was safe to do so), but he wanted to hang back and kill frequently (he was SS). I ran back to heal him after he nearly died and advised again that we don't hang back for too long. He hung back, got overwhelmed and I could not reach him with the heal gun. He died and said I was a shitty team player for not sticking together. **When kiting, you are supposed to stay way ahead of the monsters, right? If you hang back too long, too many spawn in front of you and that throws off the strategy.**

3. Joined a game on Biohazard and two guys were camped in the lounge area with the couches. I was zerk and was thinning out the crowd at the doorway. They asked me to change perks and I asked why. They said ""we don't want or need a faggot zerk"". Are there certain maps or strategies where it's considered rude to zerk or something, or were these guys just dicks?

4. Was asked to go demo during a game on biotics lab by a sharpshooter and his friend, also a sharpshooter. Went demo and asked if they minded the smoke, because if so, I should pick some other perk. The sharpshooter missed an FP three times with an m99 and it got up in his face. I thought he was going to die, so I unloaded my m32 to take out the FP. The guy was irate that I spammed grenades. Next round he missed his shots again so I did nothing, as he advised. He died and called me a faggot. I can never win! **How the fuck does one properly play demo and not piss people off?** I was also once yelled at for placing pipebombs at the start of the round. A player said that I should not place pipes until I actually see a FP, and that I should know better. How are you supposed to get into position quickly enough? Or is this guy full of shit?

You get no bonus to damage, but you do get higher penetration. pretty useful on long sightlines; set fire to specimens further away even if they're behind a group. admittedly, due to the lower damage (~1/3 of pump shotgun for a lvl 6 supp, or about 1/2 of an AA-12 shot), I've found it to be a nice backup weapon if the map allows you to use it well, such as a funnel point so you can fire n forget clot/gorefast groups. Also, you can start crisping up big guys from behind the group, even if the shot has to go through other ZEDs to reach them. Also, I will say that if you buy as a lvl 6 firebug, it's cheaper than the nailgun, and I personally prefer the trenchgun. 

Thoughts? I reckon there are other more preferable options, but I've found i'm not too bad with this. maybe it's just the novelty of ""penetrating fire shots!"", or the fact I don't really enjoy using it as firebug, so i need an excuse."	t5_2rf65	True

Her: I know. I was dealing with bs anyways.
Me: aww why

And so it begins

Her: kso [-TT-]Lenny1 is a big KF server owner. I was friends for a few hours with him, he was hitting on me, decided to invite my friends to play a game with him. He is the biggest homphobe.

12:49 AM - [-TT-]Lenny1: -REDICATED-! likes to give head along with the other bitch, -REDICATED- both of these homos are internet trollers, both of them like to get there fudge packed in other words they love to get there fudge packed in with a large johnson, another name for these to, is Rump Rangers to night they got banned in 65 server for trying to give some head on a server and trolling, the sad part of it is that 2 other had to suffer because of these two cum swalling Gay Males. It a shame that we have to persevere with these two bone smuggling fags.

Also he posted on my friends profile.

Every action has a reaction now you know why Americans dislike Canadians so much you caused all of this when you brought those two into my server? You should have apologized to me for bringing that trash into my server you just met the one guy and he has gotten you bann in 65 American servers only players like yourself and the other 3 dislike me, i have all of what happened in there on Fraps any time you want to listen to it just let me know I'm done explaining myself to you and i don't need a grammar lessons from the likes of you. Please enjoy our 4th of july holiday, just remember you are what you eat and you are what you hang around with. Have a nice day.


So just pointing out, if you play on any of his ttsfallenangels servers, that's who runs them, so be prepared to deal with homophobia, racism and the such.

Looking at it now, primarily at tactics and a few other pages, I'm noticing a few more errors and mistakes. occasionally I've stepped in and edited some pages myself, 

But I personally think the whole wiki needs a bit of a spring clean. Some pages lack information or are pretty much wrong, or have opinions rather than factual information or impartial advice. The newer articles look pretty bare, such as hillbilly horror, with moon base not even having any text!

I don't know who ""admins"" the wiki, but it's a pretty public face of the killing floor community, so I think that having in such condition reflects negatively on us a whole.

I'm posting this here since I am wondering if anyone here has links with those who run the site, or if there are any like-minded people around.

1374002253.0	1ifles	Whatever happened to skill, strategy and just using a little bit of brain power ?	DatTF2	18	4	41	"I started playing KF a bit late, a little bit before the first ever Christmas event. The game quickly drew me in and the players were nice and taught me everything I needed to know quickly like how to deal with Scrakes and Fleshpounds. Now a days I find it harder and harder to find competent players. I'll give you a few examples of what I've seen first hand lately. 

[RANT] I was a medic working on getting to level 6, I had only medic SMGs so I couldn't do a lot of damage, I was keeping my entire team topped off on health and we were doing great until this wave. Some dude was a level 3 support and when he saw a fleshpound he decided to attack it by himself with the regular pump shotgun. He pissed off the fleshpound and it decided it wanted rage after me. The fleshpound tears me apart first and then proceeds to rip most of my team in half, we were in a tight space and couldn't make an escape. 

After my death I tried to explain to him strategies for defeating a fleshpound. Another guy in the server jumps in and says ""It's not his fault that we lost that wave."" ""Well it kinda was"" I say. ""Well I didn't see you do anything that wave. You didn't heal me at all."" ""Yeah, because I was torn apart by a fleshpound at the beginning of the round because Derp decided he could solo it with a shotgun.""

Derp then goes on to change his class and I realize he's a lvl 6 demo. How can you play long enough to get to lvl 6 demo and not learn how to properly deal with scrakes and fleshpounds !? And then I become the bad guy on the server for trying to calmly explain to him how to deal with enemies. [/RANT]

Since when does calmly explaining tactics and strategy all of a sudden become ""raging ?"" If I was raging I would have called him a dumbshit and left the game. I'm not very angry and would rather explain to players how to properly deal with enemies so this kind of situation doesn't happen again.

Nobody pays attention to medics lately either. They lose 10 health and they have to heal themselves even though they're getting swarmed with enemies and here I am healing them. It's like they can't comprehend that I'm doing my best to keep them alive, I'm non existent. 

Pipe bombs are now wasted more often than not too. We had a good demo place pipes and a majority of the team wouldn't let the pipes deal with scrakes and FPs. They'd rather piss them off and let them run over the pipes setting them off without doing significant damage. 

All these lower level sharpshooters play like cowboys. They'd rather run around wasting bullets dual wielding than to learn how to properly headshot. Just a waste of bullets and all it does is make specimens harder to headshot when I'm actually playing sharpshooter. Here I am 1 shot 1 kill dealing with a herd of specimens and they run over and start unloading clips into this herd making them harder to kill for me

Another game I got the traveling team. They couldn't sit tight and hold off a spot instead they had to keep on moving and ditch half of the team when they did. Thanks to their constant moving they always ended up in shitty situations they didn't plan for like cornered in a hallway. 

I've ran into so many bad situations lately thanks to the stupidity of my teammates. It's like the average IQ of the player base has dropped 50% and they'd rather bitch, moan and argue. 

There are still good players just a lot harder to find a good team. I ran into this newbie a couple games ago. He was new to the game and had already learned the terminology (scrake, Fleshpound). I was playing as a lvl 6 commando and he was a lvl 1 commando and he easily kept up with me (so I made sure to buy higher tier weapons for him earlier in the game), being the 2nd highest scorer at the end of the round. So there is still hope, haha.

first off, Dwarfs!? can be found [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/213650/) (free to play version). To get the axe, you need to accumulate 40k gold in the game total (if you get the demo/f2p version). However, a problem that seams to be very prevolent with this game is how annoying it is to start up.

If you start up the game the first time, during setup you may get an error message, and the game will not start, and will crash when it begins to install XMA.

To fix this issue, simply go to:

program files x86\steam\steamapps\common\dwarfs (or similar name)\depends\xma. 

You should find a .exe installer inside of the xma folder. Install it, and the try to start dwarfs!? again. It may take a couple of tries, but this should fix the issue.

For me it comes down to the two I remember which are:

On aperture I saw a siren and then fired my m79 at it which then launched it 20 feet through the air and it landed right next to me and killed me. I was the last one left so everyone saw it.

Then on mountain pass (gah) there were a couple of noobs left against patty and they were just running around the map for about 15 minutes or so. Then one of them dies and the other one camps in the underpass bit next to the trader. He then goes outside as the patty comes down the stairs. Once they're both outside the patty then launches him through the air and runs in for the killing strike, however just as he's about to hit him he just trips over and died.

I found that headshot kills came a great deal easier in CS and that the teamwork tactics translated over extremely well. Everyone watched each others' backs more readily, crosshairs went straight to heads, communication was crisp and clear, and movement/cover fire was fluid and natural.

In addition, I'm in love with the blade gun. I usually main zerker, even though support is my best class, but find that it's really lacking if you want to do ANYTHING ranged. The blade gun allows me to actually have a ranged weapon that I get bonuses for, which has changed my play style surprisingly. 

The nail gun though is my favorite by far. The riccocheting nails make me able to fire wherever the fuck I please and stil get a few kills without having to reload, which will save your ass if you get cornered with the HS. While is doesn't have very high damage output, it can add dept to your playable and be a quick fix is your in. A bad situation. 

About the commando weapons: really? More commando weapons, are you serious? At least they didn't give the sharpshooter anything. Too many fucjing sharply

I've recently been working on leveling my commando class, it's currently lvl 4. I play on suicidal/hard. My questions are: what's a good way for me to accumulate stalker kills, if there is any ""improved"" way? My commando damage is far ahead of my stalker kills, and I'd like to reverse that. Are there any specific maps or something that I can do to help this?

Second, what should be my end-game commando loadout? I usually start with just the bullpup, then I buy an AK 47. I'll sell the bullpup and buy a M4 after that. From there, I sell the m4 for a SCAR or FAL (depending on which I can afford). Lastly, I'll sell the AK for the other SCAR/FAL. If I have spare cash, I'll buy a mk23 to take me from 12/15 KG to 14/15. If I've got loads of money, I'll buy a pipe bomb to make it 15/15. Is this right? If theres something better I could be doing, let me know. 

Lastly, as a level 4 commando, am I useful on the patty? (6 man, suicidal/hard). My sharpshooter and demolitions is 6, so to have better odds of killing him, I usually switch to one of those at the end of wave 10. I feel like I put out tons more damage against him with the m99 or tons of explosives. 


Overall, I'm really liking this perk, especially after getting it to level 4 it's a lot more playable. I just don't want to take forever to get level 6."	t5_2rf65	True

Priceless721	13	0	30	"2 things I want to mention so far about the recent summer deal we have going on.  On the HSG-1 shotgun there is an electronic chirp about 80% through the reload animation about when he seats the mag into the shotgun.  I do not know what exactly it indicates or why it is there.  Not sure if I like it yet.

On the other hand the MK23 is a vast improvement.  It's a .45 pistol that sounds exactly like a .45 pistol.  The IJC weapon pack MK23 has a very muted noise that I do not enjoy.  I know a true MK23 spec'd out is a silenced sidearm but this game does not have it silenced.  The Tripwire added MK23 is amazing and now the sound matches the (over)power.  I own a .45 1911 and it sounds nearly identical to the MK23 in game now.

Also, any thought on how the KSG/HSG reload should work?  In real life it holds 2 tubes of 7 and one ready to go.  The game has it with a magazine which I think is a nice compromise but maybe the alternate fire could be changed to a special ammo selector or something along those lines.

So far I am really enjoying the update but wish there was a sale.  I know 3 friends that need a copy and I want to get it for them but not at full price.

We get to the seventh round, and scrakes start becoming a common occurrence.  One rounded a corner, and since I already had my crossbow out, I shot him in the head.  Nice and easy, and one less for the group to worry about.

At the end of the round, one of our team's many sharpshooters comes up and starts giving me a hard time.  ""Hey Medic!  I'm a lvl 6 sharpshooter, I think I know how to kill a scrake!""

Fine, whatever dude.  I ignored it.  This guy kept giving me shit, though.  Eventually, 2 FPs spawn down the hall, and he runs off to solo them.  To show us how it's done, apparently.  He promptly dies.

I know that there's a bunch of tips/videos about this subject, but I'm not sure if they are outdated and/or are no longer effective, and I thought it'd be nice to store all the information in one spot. So any contributions would be very much appreciated, for everyone's benefit (but mostly for mine). I'll edit the original post as we go along. 

**EDIT:**
Forgot to mention, but this is assuming you're going at it alone. I know classes like Commando and Firebug really should not touch Scrakes and Fleshpounds, but I thought it'll be nice to know the best ways of taking them out as each class, for when your entire team is wiped out and you're the only one left standing between a victory and a mass rage quit. 

I'll start with whatever little I know:

* Medics

Not sure here, but with their armor and versatility loadout-wise, pretty much all the options for the other classes are viable. Run 'n' crossbow, axe-medic, and stuff like that.


* Support

**Scrakes:** I've seen a level 6 support down a Scrake with one hunting shotgun alt-fire, but this was on Hard with 6 players. He basically walked up to it, jumped up, and shot down at its head in mid-air. Is this viable?

**Fleshpounds:** Toss a grenade, hunting shotgun alt-fire, toss 2 more grenades. Is this guaranteed to kill at all difficulties/number of players, assuming high enough perk level?

**Bonus nubbery tactic!** W+M1 AA12


* Sharpshooter

**Scrakes:** is it possible to stunlock them forever with repeated crossbow headshots?

**Fleshpounds:** I'm assuming at around Suicidal difficulty, FPs will start requiring 2 crossbow headshots instead of 1. Does it ever go up beyond 2? Is run and crossbow a viable tactic, or is a Sharpshooter better off trying to get a quick second headshot in while the FP is raging/preparing to rage?


* Commando

Yeah...do they have anything viable against Scrakes and Fleshpounds?


* Berserker

**Scrakes:** I know you can just take a Katana and walk up to a Scrake while holding left click and aiming at its head. At what difficulty/amount of players does this stop being effective? Beyond that, is the legit tactic to stunlock forever with repeated axe headshots?

**Fleshpounds:** I assume the strategy to use here is to slowly kite, let it swing at you, and dodge + axe headshot at the same time.


* Firebug

**Scrakes:** is it possible to stunlock forever with repeated fully charged Husk Launcher headshots? This seems to be the only reliable way to survive.

**Fleshpounds:** lol


* Demolitions

**Scrakes:** uh...pipe bombs and M32 spam and hope for the best?

**Fleshpounds:** see above, but more effective?

While I had no trouble with the HSG, FAL, MkB, Trench and Mk23, I'm still having trouble figuring out how to efficiently use some other specific weapons.  


Thank you in advance!

I'm talking about the .44 Magnum and the Vlad nailgun. For some reason, they just don't seem or feel right to me. The Magnum feels less accurate than the Handcannon, despite a supposedly better range. As for the nailgun, well, I still can't figure how it should be properly used, if it's not a gimmicky item.

3rd EDIT: **The answer appears to be no**. I joined into wave 11 and got the mapchievement for Aperture. So it seems to be a random glitch on Biotics for me.

&gt;OP: After a couple of games today where I joined in progress, I didn't get any map achievements. Previously you could go as far as to just *spectate* any game on any wave and get achievements.

&gt;Sometimes this game is just a little wonky so I was wondering if anyone else could confirm or deny this. I'm going to try a couple maps started out of the lobby and will post here in about an hour.

&gt;Thanks for any help.

&gt;1st EDIT: Welp after the fact I noticed the achievement for Moonbase was there. Oddly I joined Moonbase on round 3 and got it, but there was a game of Biotics where I joined mid-round 1 and nada. There was no pop-up for Moonbase at all, the only difference I can remember was not quitting the map until the nextmap message came up. Still trying to win a damn hard game, nothing but patty wipes so far :9

&gt;2nd EDIT: Finished a Hard game of Biotics started from lobby, someone else got the map achievement immediately and I didn't.

Also, when I played UT, I would keybind (press to activate) 3rd person to make trick jumping easier. Consequently, it would auto center the reticle which would make the occasional headshot possible. Just wondering if this is possible.

In terms of control, something I've never really understood with the ut engine was how acceleration works. I am assuming that the higher I set my acceleration, the more I have to move to sweep a room, but it also allows me more precise control when I'm looking for headshots.

Wolf Pack Clan has put out a Dead Space mod which essentially turns this game into killing floor - the space version. The specimens are all new and terrifying, there's new guns, character models (I know you female gamers have always wanted to play with a female character model - now you can), and you get to throw plasma grenades that go satisfyingly supernova burning anything in their radius. 

You can check out the gametracker server page [here](http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/207.237.74.184:7713/) or for those who just want to get into it, here is the ip you need to join the server:

207.237.74.184:7713

I'm pretty sure the mod isn't *fully* complete yet as it's kind of new but it's still very playable and tons of fun. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m88qK4GhRLc) is a video on youtube of a fairly early version of the mod to give you an idea of what you're in for. Check it out! I'd even be down to play this with some redditors - [add me on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/karsey22) if you'd like!

**Edit**: I should add that especially since this is an incomplete mod **DO NOT** steal the mods from this server to host your own Dead Space server (unless in the unlikely scenario you have permission from it's creator WPC_Hemi).

The zeds will begin to spawn just out of sight to the left or right of the visible corridor, and it is possible with this technique to get 10-12 kills PER M79 grenade if timed right


Example, Hellride and the corridor groups hold up in. 
The zeds generally come from the right, and the second you see the edge of one, instantly fire a grenade at it. The grenade should land at the foot at the zed, as far right as possible.

You will see things (if there is a visible kill counter) like:
6 CLOTS
2 SIRENS
3 CRAWLERS

For each M79 round. It is possible, on hell on earth or other difficulties on various maps to do this.

Basically the grenade is going right under the zeds as they spawn / fall to the ground and they all get vaporized.

Consistent kills per game:
HOE Hellride 630+ kills and similar for other maps.

Try it out, and let me know your results. You will be swimming in cash in no time, and can either buy full pipe bombs each round, or feed the other squad members money.

Now mind you that was 630+ kills not being a total selfish jerk who will bore the other players with no kills. You have to let some through :-)

Last night she was watching some killing floor videos and she said it look pretty rad. Talking this and that, she accepted to try it.
I was really excited, but then I checked my Steam inventory and I didn't have any guest passes.

1329464353.0	ptmh2	To all of the new players coming in due to the Steam sale.	Narivus	15	5	11	"So my friend and I have been playing for a few years now. We really enjoy this game and try to play whenever we can. Now when the game comes on sale, we find ourselves not having much fun at all and not really in the mood to play. Here is the main reason:

People who are perk level 0 join our games. Now, this would be fine if we didn't play on Hard or Suicidal. I've lost track of how many games we've been in and we get to wave 7 or so then three people with level 0 perks join and then die within the first minute, rage quit, then expect us to clean up their mess. This isn't Call of Duty. You can't be John Rambo and kill everything with ease at level 0 and this is why.

* If your perks are level 0-2, you will not be very affective playing in a Hard or Suicidal game. Play on Normal to not only get the hang of the game and learn what each specimen does, but to get started leveling your perks.

* Once your perks are about level 3 and you have adjusted to the team based style of play, you can try playing on Hard.

* At about level 4 or so, try Suicidal. If you find yourself having trouble, go back to Hard and get some more practice in. Same deal with Hell on Earth at level 5.

* Notice I said team based . This means that you need to work together and stuff. Watch people's backs. Heal them by pressing 5 once and left clicking. Never use your self heal unless you are being chased and no one can get to you fast enough.

Hopefully this didn't seem rude to anyone, I'm just tired of having to stop playing this game whenever there is a Steam sale.

tl;dr - Play on the appropriate difficulty based on your perk levels please! All you do by joining games that are way out of your league is make people angry."	t5_2rf65	True

Now, I thought nothing of it, until I saw him play. He consistently would get headshots no matter the distance, even if it were while he was jumping.

At first, I wasn't exactly against him. I was stuck with a trio of incompetent players: A lvl 0 Commando, a level 0 Medic, and a level 2 Sharpshooter. All 3 were convinced that welding themselves into a barn would keep them alive, and when that plan went to hell they naturally blamed me for welding them in (which is moronic; I'm just glad they probably didn't know about the vote kick function). These guys would consistently die every round, blame me, then ask for money when they spawned. So the aimbotter seemed like a god-send at the time.

However, the game became boring. As I was playing Berserker, I couldn't get within 5-feet of a Zed without seeing their head being blown off by the guy on the other end of the map. So eventually, I got bored and quit. Then I decided to report him to Steam, but I guess I feel a little guilty about that. Was it wrong of me to report him?

Took me 30 min after doing the tutorial.

Two types of dwarfs - diggers and warriors

*There is a max on the number of warriors you can have at a given time, but not diggers.
Spend money to get warriors, diggers just continuously spawn.

*Build outposts to increase number of warriors, outposts can level warriors by spending gold. They also have cannons to launch warriors quickly. Will only launch warriors trained at that outpost, max of 4.

*There are unexplored caves that either have enemies, lava, water, gold, or nothing. Gold is gathered automatically, need warriors to kill enemies, hold shift and click to build walls to stop water from flooding, lava slowly burns through walls. Press W and click to place dynamite, direct a dwarf to dynamite to blow it up. This creates a hole for water or lava to drain. WARNING: dwarfs will dig through walls! Hold control and click to make some areas un-diggable, so your dwarfs do not accidentally release more lava/water.

*Hold S to speed up the game.

tl;dr

*Dwarf releases water/lava

1. build wall with shift+click

2. place dynamite with W

3. blow dynamite with a dwarf

4. block off area with ctrl+click

*Dwarf finds enemies

1. build outpost near enemies with E

2. train warriors at outpost by clicking outpost and warrior icon

3. click training dummy to level warriors

4. click cannon and launch warriors at enemy

*Nothing happening

Same goes for the fork lifts, I don't think hillbillies wouldn't buy specialized equipment, they would use a truck. Why are there warning signs everywhere? I feel like Tripwire just really like warning signs, but hillbillies probably couldn't care less about professional safety standards. Why are there no confederate flags? Where is the moonshine?

Playing our 'best' classes we have

* Lv 4 sharpshooter
* Lv 3 support
* Lv 3 commando
* Lv 2 commando/demo (new guy)

We try and shoot what we're ment to, medics and commandos shoot the masses, sharpshooter crossbows the scary things, demo shoots himself. Yet we eventualy let a fleshpound or somethign through. We're also experiimenting with pipe bombs. Our sharpshooter likes them and hasn't died to a zombie in a while. Also there's a thought that having the medic play demo instead would be better.

Not my plugin, but I personally reckon this is a pretty epic game mode, and alot more steam workshop stuff could/should be posted here.

Basically, slowly the number of clots increases over time, as do their stats. eventually, we're talking &lt;2 hits kill players, people. getting grabbed later on is pretty much an instant death. trader is always open. Think of it as a horde mode; the round lasts as long as you do. clots don't give alot of money, so it's worth saving up from the start.

Run it on farm with the bots plugin (the one that lets you spawn 40+ AI bots) to see a pretty neat zombie apocalypse simulation! they all split up and hole up in each of the camp spots, slowly get picked off one by one, the chat feed telling you which team's hiding spot has been overrun.

I suggest this

**getting unspecified steam errors or missing perks?**

*try restarting killing floor, steam, Your computer, or simply joining another server. 

*chefk to make sure steam is online

*check your internet connection

*check to make sure the server you are on has perks enabled (check the *perks enabled* checkbox in the server browser)

*wait. This happens sometimes, just give it time to fix itself. 

*verify your killing floor files (right click killing floor&gt;properties&gt;local files&gt;verify integrity if game cache)

Not working? Post about it!

A few years ago, I created the RUKFC steam group, and I managed it for a while. Over the last few years, I've had less and less time when it comes to online games, and I haven't touched Killing Floor in over a year now. I have, however, started to notice a surge of posts here on /r/killingfloor, as you guys typically filter into my frontpage.

While I would love to keep the group in my groups list, I don't have any inclination to administrate it, organise events, or engage the KF community, primarily due to RL commitments.

I posted an announcement on the groups announcement page over a year ago, Nov 1st 2011, and got no reply, so I was wondering if someone here wanted to take the reigns as it were.

It would make an amazing organisationnal tool for the Redditors that play on the reddit servers, and provide an in-game/out-of-game chat area for all likeminded zedkillers of this sub.

Please let me know if you are interested, in either reply on this thread, or in PM, and provide reasons as to why and how you want to use it for the community. 

I'd rather not hand it over to someone that's going to misuse it, afterall.

At the current moment, our sharpshooter peruses the HC/Xbow loadout, which I think is vastly inferior to the LAR/EBR. It offers much more damage potential and versatility; making it useful not just against trash but also against medium and large-sized specimens.

**you can set it so that people get their weapons when YOU decide** that way, you always know what players will be walking into the situation with, a rough guess of ammo, an estimate of armour, etc. it also removes some cost penalties, it doesn't matter if one guy is getting all the cash, stealing kills, a weapon will spawn in the next room for a moneyless player who just joined

If you don't understand what I mean, if you're playing firebug and you have a MAC10 and a Flamethrower, they're both on the ""3"" key and there's nothing on ""4"".

After 45 hours in two weeks time,  I am smitten with this game and I feel like this could be a great idea to enhance my enjoyment and the longevity of my interest.  Has anyone done this?  If so, what control do you have over the server, any suggested sites, pros/cons, costs, ect?

Thanks for your input and for everyone making this one of the best gaming communities I have ever been a part of.

Edit:  I rented a server from gameservers.com.  It has been running great and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  Support has been helpful, but my only complaint is there is not very many tutorials for computer challenged folks such as myself.  

I have been learning though and figuring stuff out, trial by fire style.  I can add maps easily enough, change the server name and some setting, even a few mutators, but other mutators are causing me grief.  My other complaint is that I could only login as admin during the game one time, other times when I enter my info a blank like appears.  It doesn't even give me an error message, just nothing.  This sucks for changing the difficulty, I have to go into the code, change it, then reset my server to change difficulty every time.

Thanks for everyone suggestions and help!  The server is 68.232.177.141:7707.  Feel free to join, message me with suggestions/ideas if you can think of any to improve it!"	t5_2rf65	True

My question is, what is the most efficient way to take down a raging FP or Scrake? Is it best to backpedal and fire or crouch and aim for the head? I seem to be doing ok backpedaling +M1, I'd just like some clarification on the ""100 percent miss from point blank"".

Obviously, as you guys will know, it gets slightly boring when playing by yourself. If you're interested, bu sure to add me on steam. ""XAirShadow"" is my user.  

Anyway, My short story. Basically, I was playing by myself on a server to try and practise and get a bit better. The first match, someone joins about round 3 and buys whatever he needs etc. He ends up dying in the first few seconds of the round leaving me with a bunch of Zeds. I end up dying a bit after.  
The next game, I go commando and around round 6, someone else joins. I go to the trader and the other guy is a sharpshooter. He asks for money and I already had my SCAR so I gave him all I had which was around 300. He ends up buying a bullpup instead of a LAR and I was already having negative thoughts. Once the round starts, he gets instantly swarmed and I heal him once, but he's backing up into a corner so I knew there was not much I could do. He asks for help via radio, but I'm already too far to do anything. He then proceeds to die and say ""F*CK YOU"" (Without the asterisk) and then leave. I end up making it to round 10, but I end up dying to my own pipe bomb.

1333856824.0	rysw3	UPDATE: KF Fanfic	Seriou	10	2	1	"Hey guys. So I've been on vacation, and I've been stumped on a scene in the fanfic I'm writing. Here are the notes on the scene I jotted down on my laptop:


Character's name is Malcolm Foster
(This will probably be the only non-canon use of a name in this story, sorry!)
He is a psychologist with a slight medical background, and consults with Horzine Industries on their secret clone project. NOT a stockbroker. :/
He specifically helps in training the clones, leading in the failed task of training the scrakes to act as field medics, and to mass-train them for this, and attempting to give fleshpounds the ability to control their anger to avoid harming members of his squad.
He is an immigrant from the U.S., and moved to Europe for better opportunities and to escape the ever-increasing political corruption.
Horzine intended the clone army to aid the British military in warfare.

He is also (Eric?)'s personal therapist, who was suffering from paranoia and was generally mentally unhealthy.

At the time of the initial outbreak of the clones, he was in a café waiting for a meeting with a chief (engineer?) on the project (I'm on the road as I'm writing this, can't look up various names and information. He is the character in the hazmat suit) to discuss pressing matters (to be determined). Ends up fleeing through the chaotic streets of London in a frantic chase, somehow encounters DJ Scully in the middle of the onslaught.

Details on the chase TBD.

Still trying to consider what will happen after they escape London. Will they flee to a nearby town? Countryside? This is the main part that's been holding me back from writing the story, I can't quite figure out what will happen in these highly important series of scenes.

This takes place sightly in the future, so some things mentioned in the story don't exist yet.

I have determined that the ultimate goal of the group of survivors is to cross the continent in a solar-powered, repurposed double decker bus to get to the East coast of Russia and recieve an evacuation from the US military into Alaska.

Any help would be awesome. If I could get tips, edits, ANYTHING, I would be VERY grateful.

Killing Floor being an awesome co-op game must have its moments too right?

So, let's share them. 

I'll start.
Some days ago, while playing with my girlfriend and a bunch of other guys, I achieved Medic lvl 6 while playing Commando. We were at Biotics at wave 10 on Normal and I decide to test my new medic skills.
Long story short, eveyone died because of 2 FP's and Scrake (I felt like the worst medic), so I run for my life while carrying a MP5 and a LAR.
There were like a hundred twenty-ish zeds remaining and chasing me from all sides. I killed every little zed I could with my MP5 and LAR.

When I run out of ammo, there were only Scrakes, FPs, Husks, Sirens and Bloats. I threw my weapons away and pick up sharpie's HC, an a Zerker's Claymore.
I managed to kill the Siren, husks, and bloats. Now to deal with the scrakes I used the claymore and now there were only the 2 FPs.
I kite one with the HC until I fucked it up and he raged.
BOOM, no more armor.
I killed it but the other one raged as well.
I ran and ran and ran. I got stuck on a door, he hitted me. I kept running. Change to healing syringe, ran slow. Hit me again. EVERYTHING'S OVER. My life passed right before my eyes.

**Target priority**. What is  it, and how does it change between the classes. Also, **what perks should I play** if 

* Both of them are LVL 6 support

* I don't have very high levels

* I don't prefer playing Firebug, and I'll only play medic if I have to

I have read up on target priority recently, and every page I see says something different, some pages say rush the FP and scrake, but other say leave them alone until end of round, and others say take them out when you have to. These are all clearly different strategies, and all are very valid, but which should I play?

As a last request, what are some words of advice for a newer player, I already know what all of the classes are based on (although **I don't really know what they should prioritize on doing**), and I know some maps pretty well, like Biolabs (that's really all actually, kind of sad)

1368697600.0	1efxl9	I suck shit with Killing Floor SDK, and need help making a map of mine a reality	PigAteMyPie	8	2	5	"As the title says, I'm terrible when it comes to using the ~~Source Development Kit~~ SDK, and have ideas for a Killing Floor map that I want to become a reality. I made a half-arsed layout for it [here](http://i.imgur.com/zUs2WPj.png), so people could get a bit of a picture of what I'm about to talk about. My idea for the story goes as following;

New Zealand was one of the unlucky country's, and is being invested with clones. A lot of the survivors have moved to a country-side town, were the gathering hall is used more than any other house for some reason. Anyway, they're informed that the next town down has been destroyed by these naked zombie fucks, and that they should probably move really fucking fast. They move out; clones move in. Your squad is assigned to clear out the town. You go to the gathering hall since there's not many clones there, and set up shop. Then in the middle of the night, a shit ton of clones start moving in on the hall, leaving you to kill the bastards.

Now, I think we should just leave the name to be called kf-gatheringhall, mainly because I'm not sure if any towns here will suit this setting. But if any of you guys who also live here in NZ find a place worthy of becoming a set of a post-apocalyptic clone/zombie co-op survival horror, I'd be happier than... I don't really know what joke I could put here but I'd be really bloody happy.

So, could I please have some help with this? 

Edit: User Ihmhi found a good tutorial with this, which I am currently using now. It doesn't really have a good explanation with the doors and traders, but I've managed to create a room and a hallway.

I spam '1' after pressing Q, then spam '4' after the syringe gets put away but it takes closer to 3 seconds to pull off.

In another video, on HoE with 5 fake players, a guy uses the regular shotgun, then switches to knife, then back to lessen the reload time. Then he pulls out a hunting shotgun, jumps up, and empties both barrels point blank into a scrake's neck, which immediately drops it.

1343714948.0	xfq7u	Firebug Loadouts		9	3	16	"Hello r/killingfloor,

I'm new to the game and the community, and I've found myself particularly attached to the firebug. Due to the weight of his class weapons, I've found there's little flexibility in alternative loadouts. Nonetheless, two possibilities have stood out to me:

* The Mac-10 and Flamethrower. This is the less expensive loadout. Though they are inexpensive weapons, I've found the combination to be complimentary, effective, and beneficial to the team for crowd control of low to medium power enemies like clots, gorefasts, crawlers, etc.

* The Mac-10 and Husk Fireball. This takes a few rounds to save up for, of course, but the power and range of the Husk are a force to be reckoned with. It increases viability in fights against harder opponents, at least in situations where other classes are distracted, like Scrakes and Fleshpounds. However, crowd control appears to be less effective. The Husk, weighing 8 instead of 10, allows for another sidearm. I usually select the .44, as it is able to kill stronger opponents in a couple cylinders.

Is one loadout clearly better for higher difficulties? I understand that the price-tag would suggest that the Husk is the better option, but I haven't found the flamethrower to be much less effective, and that cash could keep more expensive team-mates up to date in arms, like a Commando. Additionally, the .44 is completely negotiable. Is it the optimal 2-block choice? Finally, is the Mac-10 immutable? It seems a shame to not exploit the afterburn, but a shotgun is attractive in some situations.

*(Opinionated sidenote: I honestly believe that while raging FPs may be seen as griefing, it can also be seen as an amateur mistake. So please please don't kick the poor player that does it the first time; I've seen some people get kicked for this and it makes me really sad--I mean, the natural response when some bigass monster with spike hands appears in front of you and starts taking a whack at you is to shoot it right?)*

Anyways, I was looking at the griefing page, thinking about an incident that happened to me yesterday. Here's how it went down:

I joined a server, as players who play Multiplayer normally do. Decided I needed a break, so I entered a DMM.net Hard KF-BellTolls one (It's a west coast one, so the people on the East Coast: don't worry too much about it). I sat in there for maybe two or so minutes with a guy who was ready to go and another AFK person--either that, or he was just ridiculously quiet--when suddenly three more people join. They jostle around the Ready button a bit, bouncing back and forth between Ready and Unready. I'm a bit curious about this, but then my curiousity turns to annoyance when one of the three tells me something along the lines of ""**** or john, leave so one of our bros can join."" Huh. Well, I was here first, so no. ""If you really want him in so badly, there's a lot of other available servers you can join.""

No response. I wait a minute or so and the three are still silent. Suddenly,
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Wrex."" (Two tried to respond at the same time)
""Shephard.""
""Wrex.""
""Shephard."" And so on. 

They keep doing this for three or so minutes, and while I appreciate Mass Effect 2 references, I would prefer more if the game would just start. Eventually it got to the point where the game just auto-started in 18 or so seconds (I did not know that if you waited an absurdly long time with a few people ready, game would auto-start). So here I am thinking ""Yay! Game time!""

Well. Apparently the three are a bit miffed I or AFK-guy didn't leave, so they start running away from us, trying to isolate us to die. Well, trick worked on AFK-guy (I'd be surprised if it didn't). I chased after them for a while, but then decided ""Fuck it"" and ran off on my lonesome. Nice thing about berzerker is that you don't die easily. So I didn't.

I apologize if you actually took the time to read everything before this, cause the next part is actually the important part. I'm long-winded, and that's why I prefer Chat over Text in-game.

Trader time between Wave 1 and Wave 2. We all run in, except AFK-guy, who apparently didn't get the Trader's memo. I run out with my gear and wait. Two of the three get an aneurysm. ""Well shucks."" The third stays, a Level 5 Commando. 

So here's the main part: I toss him a few quid (pounds, sterlings, meso, rupees, whatever you guys at Tripwire use over there) and I expect him to use it to buy stuff. Well, he doesn't. Then Wave 2 starts. He pulls out his knife and runs around everywhere, trying to toss cash into inaccessible places. No problem, this kid just has ADHD or something, right? NOPE. After tossing all his cash and specifically waiting for the Wave to start so there's about 120 or so zombies between the four of us (Me, Random Guy, AFK-dude, and ADHD-boy), he leaves. Only a knife left where he was. Also, his lumpy limp body and ugly face. Gorefast gets AFK-dude, Crawler gets Random Guy (he leaves), and ADHD-boy already got himself a few seconds ago. So now I'm left with 100 zombies out for my blood. 

So now my question for you guys is this: is the aforementioned action of sorrow and frustration and general all-around blllarrrgghhhness done by ADHD-boy considered griefing? I felt like this was done out of spite, to try to teach me a lesson to move out of the way of groups of threes wanting room for one of their ""bros"". 

Just in case you wanted to know, I survived. Ran around the map so many times I could've sworn I ran a marathon. Or two. Maybe five. Point is, I ran so damn much. Some people joined one at a time, then left when they saw me alone, taking my sweet time soloing. Wave ends, Trader time, AFK-dude still here AFKing. Level 5 Support joins, doesn't make it to Trader, Wave 3 starts, and he's left with only his starting Shotgun. He dies. Then AFK-dude dies. I'm left alone with the rest of the damned zombies. By this point, I had given up on relaxing (soloing is not relaxing at all, by any means) and was about to leave. Then I figured I may as well solo this wave, and if I have to solo another 120 zombies next wave, I'll leave then. 

Story ends here. Two more people join, I tell them wearily ""Look at the fucking scoreboard. Wave 3 and already I have 210 kills. Please don't make me solo another round."" 
Generic automated response ""Yes.""
I ask them ""What level are you guys?""
Good news for me, cause these guys are level 6 Sharp and Level 6 SS. Well goody, at least these guys won't die as fast.
Rest of the waves went well--we just hid in a corner, the three of us, and survived the next few waves until more people joined. Killed patty. High-fives all around.

Yay, yay, yay.

**TL:DR** Is joining for the sole purpose of spawning more zombies for the lone guy who inadvertently pissed off a group of people by not leaving considered griefing? It's not on the wiki article, and we all know wikipedia is the most trusted source out there."	t5_2rf65	True

&gt; Crossbow (waves 7/8-10)

The commando stayed behind while I took out my crossbow, headshot and enraged the one FP, then finished him with another while he charged towards me down the stairs, did the exact same thing to the other FP and then took out the scrake afterwards, and then we ran back up and joined the other guys. Felt so awesome to not have taken a single hit or lost any armor after that episode. 

The best GAME I had was definitely the 6-man suicidal on kf-manor where I also played sharpshooter with the crossbow and we were ganged up in the cave but were being pushed back as it got tougher and tougher.

The mod would add extra difficulties to the players such as:

* Ammo had weight
* Limited chat range
* Limited amount of syringe usage
* Syringes needing to purchased at the trader

Suicidal and HoE are a good challenge at first but with a smart group it begins to get watered down and lose the challenge. I'm looking for something that would give a stronger impact on mistakes and missed shots as well as encourage others to work more together and be constantly aware of what the team is doing. 

Obviously there would be some compensation for the extra difficulties, and certain perks/classes would be given different benefits (i.e. medics get more syringes and would be the only class able to regenerate them, although at a much slower pace to prevent abuse).

 I might be asking for too much but if anyone is looking for a new project for a mod I think this could pose a new challenge to the Zed Survivors.

I don't care if perks aren't enabled.  
  
From what i've searched, the command ""Set Engine.Gameinfo Maxplayers 20"" should work, however it does not. I get no error, but still only 6 people can be in the server at once. I've tried using webadmin and ingame after logging in to admin.

   The following Has been sent in a email to the devs but other than that I dont know what to do. Is anyone else having this problem, or just my friend?



&gt;""Tripwire,

&gt;I've been a huge fan of Killing Floor ever since it came out and still play it regularly with a large group of friends I've introduced to it. We all work at the same part time job so when we're at work we talk about Killing Floor and when we come home we play it. It's a lot of fun.

&gt;Unfortunately, one of us has Mac OS X. I don't know if you're aware but as far as  I can tell the Mac version of Killing Floor is very broken. No perks are being saved at all, my friend is stuck eternally at level 4 while everyone else levels past him. He gets perk points in every match, but they disappear when he disconnects. There are absolutely no answers on the forum and as fans it really hurts to see no solutions or responses from anyone. We thought with the Christmas update it would fix it. Color us surprised when we updated and he still has this issue. The only thing this leaves us with is the idea that Tripwire would create a poor port for the Mac and then not bother fixing it, leaving all the Mac fans in the dust. It sucks, and none of us enjoy it anymore because all we can think about it is how we'd have to force one of our friends to purely tolerate this irritating bug until some probable future date where Tripwire maybe might fix it or just release more non-working events.

&gt;Is there anything we can do to get this fixed? At this point we've tried everything. We want to keep playing Tripwire games, but at this point, there appears to be no other option but to stop.

&gt;Thanks for your time,

Cut to a real game, and the patriarch behaves nothing like testmap.

Is this due to the design of the testmap? Perhaps the Patriarch reacts in a ""bottled"" manner and it doesn't translate to real gameplay?

Example.. demo lvl 6, patriarch.

If you zig-zag the pipes, he will hit one and immediately walk away from the explosion into another bomb. It's possible to kill him this way.

Real game, the bombs don't detonate, or they do so after he passes. He also goes around them sometimes.

I'm really having a hard time refining my solo demo Patriarch kill as the testlevel seems so unrealistic it makes practicing real tactics hard.

I am sure the regular high end HOE players would have a blast doing this, we would just have to set up a server ( I have a few keys) so we

So i started up solo mode and was choosing perks and characters when I noticed my Harold Lott character was completely missing. I don't even see him as a selectable character anywhere anymore. It was a minor set back as I usually play as a Steampunk character anyway.

Finally got into the game, as a support specialist, and realize all my good shotguns are gone for later. AKA the AA12 and then I noticed a lot of other weapons were missing too.

Sorry if this doesn't *entirely* belong in this subreddit, but this seems pretty suitable, since I'm talking about a character from Killing Floor. Anyway, I'm shopping around the internet to put together a cosplay of Steampunk Mr. Foster, but I'm having a bit of trouble finding everything I need. I think I found a few suitable gas masks, though, nothing that compares very similarly to Mr. Fosters. I found a [suit](http://img3.etsystatic.com/000/0/5920560/il_570xN.351795939.jpg) that is near perfect, even though it's not completely identical. I'll probably replace the undershirt with a plain long-sleeved white one I found, and then replace the tie with a blue one. If I dig a bit deeper, I can easily find blue pants (hell, shouldn't take much time at all.) Gloves are easy, but what about that metal piece around his wrist/arm? [These boots](http://img0.etsystatic.com/000/0/5212926/il_570xN.140473364.jpg) should work, but if anyone finds anything better, or just as good (I could compare prices, or see which ones I like better, if I have multiple choices) please inform me of your find. I found a few holsters for the thigh that I can work with, but more suggestions would be great. What I'm having trouble with the most, really, is the over-the-shoulder pouch. If anyone can find something similar or identical to Steampunk Mr. Fosters, that'd be crazily appreciated.

So, basically, I'm good as far the suit goes, probably pants as well, but all suggestions for gas masks, holsters, pouches, boots, and of course, the metal piece for the arm would be extremely appreciated. Oh, and I haven't really bothered searching around for the straps he has on his forearms (holding the sleeves), so if you have time, it'd be cool if you could suggest some of that, too.

Hilarity ensued.	blue_gatorade	12	9	14	"I had joined a game, and i had the standard $250, and I wanted to grab a bullpup. It was heading into wave 3. One of our armorless teammates offered to let me try and farm enough heals to pick up a bullpup, so I started knifing him and healing him. I knew it was futile, but the offer was nice anyway, and I need medic points.

Suddenly, 'blue_gatorade was killed by &lt;player&gt;'. Before the round started. I asked him why, and he replied, 'you were team attacking noob'. I wrote it off, and waited out the round. 

Next round comes along, and picked up a bullpup and we got to work. Round was going great, everyone was healthy, when suddenly, 'blue_gatorade was killed by &lt;player&gt;.' I had been watching lines of fire, and I was at full health. This was obviously not an accident. 

When I asked him why this team, he ignored me. Then, in the feed, '&lt;player y&gt; was killed by &lt;player&gt;'. Next thing I saw was '&lt;player&gt; killed by &lt;player z&gt;', followed by a string of taunts over chat. The whole team had turned on the tk'er and destroyed him. 

Next round, I spawned on the shotgun he'd dropped, and headed to the shop. He started plinking at me as soon as he saw me, but I continued to run to the store, 'oblivious'. I took a hard left at one of the openings, and when he ran by, I blew him away with his own shotgun. One of other players suggested we kick him, but a level 5 player just said 'nah, we know how to take care of guys like this'. Player immediately quit. 

We proceeded to have a great round full of fun chat.

Just curious, does this happen a lot? Was I wrong in blowing this guy after he tk'd 3 times in two very easy rounds?

1: Medics only advance their level if they heal teammates. So if you are injured and it isn't crucial that you heal yourself now, try and wait for the medic to heal you. If the medic is no where in sight then take that into account on whether you should heal yourself. 

2: Medics don't need a lot of money to buy their best weapons so dropping a little extra money to them in the first 1-3 rounds will allow them to easily do their job. Also for subsequent rounds their upkeep costs are low so they can dole out some money to everyone to pay them back for the earlier assistance.

3: If your medic is nearby and you are in need of healing try and stand still for a few seconds if possible. If the medic is not right next to you they will try to heal using their ranged syringe presuming they bought a medi gun. An erratically moving target is harder to hit than a stationary target.

4: For high enough level medics with body armor, they can take a lot of damage and generally a medic should be able to protect themselves from small numbers of zeds depending on the current wave. A high enough level medic with a hunting shotgun can even handle a scrake by themselves. So sacrificing your own position to assist a medic that is under attack is not always necessary. 

This is all I could think of. If you have your own suggestions please include them. "	t5_2rf65	True
1327725969.0	p05dk	Strange lag-spike issues...?	pieoncar	6	1	15	"Today the game started giving me very frequent ""lag spikes"" to the point where it is unplayable.  For example, my character might stop moving for 1-2 seconds and then everything is in a different place and I can move again, or I'll be moving and then me and the enemies all jump to a different place without warning.

The weird thing is that when it's between rounds and I can fly around with the free camera, it's completely smooth.  Or even when I died and I went through large groups of zeds, even that ran completely smoothly.
