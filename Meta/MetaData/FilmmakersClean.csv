The new home for filmmakers on reddit will be r/filmmakers.

A CSS Redirect page will go up on both /r/filmmaking and /r/WeAreTheFilmmakers to redirect automatically. It's been a long time needed, having three subreddits that everyone subscribes to but not every one posts to has become out of hand and unnecessary.

This merge will create one subreddit for all to enjoy with the same moderators that you have come to like on the individual subreddits.

If you have any questions, let us know. :)

EDIT: For the first week, the redirect will be hard to migrate users quickly. Following the completion of the week, we will leave the subreddit in read only mode and remove the hard redirect in exchange for a large, unattractive header which will make all the old posts readable."	t5_2r1ip	True

1346803522.0	zd4tw	Would anyone be interested in an in-depth color grading lesson for DSLR shooters?	Diffusional	277	23	100	"All too often I see a video posted here of someone's first film or project, asking for a critique of some kind, and I can usually expect to see something that was shot (usually on a DSLR) that has been absolutely glazed over with crushing contrast, sharp highlights, over-coloring, over-saturation or de-saturation, usually some kind of distracting vignette, and more contrast again.

Those are all bad habits, some of which can be attributed to the way you're actually shooting the footage before you've even gone into post. By using something called *Technicolor CineStyle* when shooting, you'll be able to capture the image in a very RAW-emulating way, giving you a very flat, low-contrast image that retains the color information in the footage much better than Canon's preset styles. Once you've downloaded the Technicolor CineStyle preset, installed it into your camera, shot your footage using it, then captured it onto your computer, you'll have *way* more flexibility with the footage when you're doing your brightness/contrast adjustments, color correction, and color grading. Keep in mind, this isn't actually RAW footage, but the shooting style preset by Technicolor emulates certain characteristics of RAW footage that will benefit your grading process greatly.

That aspect of it is quite objective, and is important to allow yourself to be set up with a blank canvas to work on. However, the actual art of color grading is far more subjective and takes much practice and experience. I wanted to know if any of you would be interested in learning some basic, intermediate, and complex grading techniques, tips, and problem-solving strategies through either a live broadcast ""seminar"" where you can watch and follow along, or perhaps a video that you can pause and play and move along at your own pace with.

As I am looking down into the monitor nearly with my nose in the hood I feel someone place there hand on my neck. I thought it was the operator perhaps letting me know that I was nailing the focus or hoping it was the cute makeup artist saying hello. So I didn't think much of it. Within a split second I felt the barrel of a gun press to the back of my head. I was lucky enough that I quickly ducked right. 

The man grabbed the camera and two other men came from the other direction. To help I quickly ducked behind a car at which point. On of the men raised his gun into the air and fired. I can thankfully say no one was even injured but the camera was taken (about $60-70k worth of gear). 

I just want to let some of you younger guys know when you are shooting gorilla. Just be aware or make sure someone is and think twice about your location. "	t5_2r1ip	True

For most of you, your only contribution to this subreddit has been to bitch and moan about amateur's and hobbyist's posts. Think of how less contributing that is to our craft and this subreddit than the posts by newbs who hope to be great storytellers. 

The solution? How about the next time you feel compelled to shit on someone, take a breath and think about a way to contribute to this community, what worth can you add to its value. 

There are enough pretentious pricks in this universe. Most of them are that way because they have thin skin. I'm asking (pleading) for us to have thicker skin and simply direct people asking for camera suggestions to the wiki, tell Kickerstarter fundraisers good luck, and try to inspire someone.

1350222531.0	11gkc1	Filmmakers are Artists, not Technicians. Stop simply talking about equipment, and start teaching yourself about why people make films in the first place.	nashx90	341	120	124	"It's all well and good to love the technology and techniques used to capture your film - it's fine to be a stickler for audio fidelity, high dynamic range, denoising, whatever-the-hell-else. It's obviously important to be a good craftsman when making anything.

But this subreddit is unique in that, unlike /r/editors, /r/audioengineering, /r/vfx, or any of the other departmental subreddits, we call ourselves ""Filmmakers"". We don't simply edit clips together, we don't simply analyse multimeters and dB levels, we don't simply assemble complex scenes from vertices and splines - we *make films*. (I'm using the word ""simply"" just to highlight the independence of these various tasks, not to suggest that they are in any way easier or inferior tasks).

And making films is an artform, an artform that calls upon the histories of almost all other artforms - from music to theatre; from literature to painting; from dance to sculpture. We draw upon a vast, VAST wealth of art stretching back to the birth of art as a concept, and all this subreddit seems to care about is budgets, equipment and tech demos.

* Next time someone asks for feedback on their film, don't just assume that they only want a technical assessment on their ability to operate certain pieces of equipment. Talk about their films like the artworks they are all intended to be.
* Next time you post a link to a film you've made - a short, a feature, something in between, whatever - talk about your tech specs, sure, but don't forget to talk about your artistic motivations as well. Tell us why you made your film - if you only make films to play around with equipment, then you are a technician, not a filmmaker.

Read some books on films, even the broadest stuff, and come to an understanding about why people make films, what makes a great film, what makes art in general, and use all those nuggets of information to help bring everything you do out of the realm of competence and into the realm of artistry.

And to those who suggest that talking about film art and filmmaking should be separated in different subreddits, I ask for what other reason is there to make and share films other than art? For what other purpose do we talk and try to better ourselves within filmmaking, if not in the pursuit of better art?

EDIT: Sorry to be so bullish with the post title - I'm not saying that technical matters are irrelevant. All I'm saying is that they need to be complemented by discussion about why these technical matters are used in the way that they are. What certain lighting says about a character, how certain lenses alter audience perception, how distorted sound or a slightly misaligned white balance may actually enhance the mood of a certain shot or scene. Just bits and pieces that let us expand our minds a bit. Let's apply some critical engagement to the films we submit here for critique, and not just focus on the technical issues without explaining why they are issues from an audience perspective.

**TL;DR EDIT:** There are plenty of subreddits dedicated to the individual crafts and technical sides of film. This is the only one where we can - and should - talk about these technical elements in relation to the films we hope to make with them. Less of a focus on the size of your sensor, more of a focus on what a large sensor can do to help you tell stories and/or create a mood."	t5_2r1ip	True

Apparently Lionsgate has been inundated with comedies right now and the powers that be are shy about picking up comedies.

They did promise us distribution however! Which is awesome. Even if they pass on finance, we have a verbal agreement with them on distro. Now we go along the process of getting the equity to film.

I'm not doing this for money right now although I'd like to make a career out of it. Right now I'm just looking to collaborate and get my work out there while helping you get your work out there.

Also, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. If anyone is interested just let me know and I can send you some examples.

EDIT: I will be out of town in Manchester, Tennessee for a music festival from the 13th - 17th but I will be right back to work as soon as I get back, just in case anyone tries to contact me and I don't get back right away. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

I originally did not want to post a link to any of my stuff as I felt it could be limiting, but I just set up a soundcloud for some of my past compositions for anyone interested: https://soundcloud.com/matt-s-composer These are all over a year old and more commercial orientated than anything else.

Since then I started pursuing music as a singer/songwriter/one man band (Indie Electronic type stuff) Here are my two most recent projects: https://soundcloud.com/goexploring https://soundcloud.com/son-xiu

I am not limited to this music I have posted here and I am fairly confident I can create what you might be looking for, weather its dramatic, dark, dissonant, anything. Some things may be more challenging than others, but that's why I'm here and doing this in the first place.

I am also not opposed to any of the music I have posted here being used in your project if you find something you like.

Anyways, I look forward to working with a lot of you. Thank you for your time.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for responding, wow I never expected this much but this is fantastic. I tried to follow through with everyone that contacted me and please, if I missed anyone, please send me a message, I'd love to work with you. 

I'm out of town for the next few days but don't hesitate to send me a message. I'll respond as soon as I can. I'll be back around the 17th or 18th and I'll be right back to work as soon as I get back. 

I made all the songs on my soundcloud composer page downloadable in case anyone has a project and they need something right away. Just let me know you're using it. 

I look forward to working with and collaborating with you all, and please don't hesitate to follow up or contact me with a project you're working on at any time. I'm always ready and I'm always making music.

My email is mscime@fullsail.edu for anyone interested.

Thank you all again, I look forward to working on your projects and making something unique and awesome.

1359940083.0	17u65b	Need to rant.  Rich brat has HIJACKED my production.	sweetalkersweetalker	205	50	99	"(edited for clarity, I was reeeeally pissed off when I wrote this)

Before we started shooting I asked the local college for help - told them we'd like to use their students as camerapeople and makeup artists, and would it be possible for the school to please give credit for that? Answer:  NO, we don't do that here.

Also asked local restaurants if they'd like to provide our cast/crew with food for a day, in exchange for having their place (the outside of their place, with their logo showing) featured prominently in the film.  Answer:  NO, we don't do that here.

Also asked our local theater if they'd possibly show our film there, in exchange for half the ticket sales.  Answer:  NO, we don't do that here.

Okay, that's fine.  Shrug the shoulders, move on.

Our film crew of 25 included this rich teenager who donated half our needed budget in exchange for a co-starring role.  Turned out he was, frankly, a brat.  Never showed up on time, never listened to anything anyone told him.  He kept rewriting his lines and ""accidentally"" saying them wrong.  (We didn't know it then, but he was badmouthing the film to everyone, mocking it.)  Took a 2 week vacation out of state without telling anyone in our 3rd week of shooting - we had to reschedule around him.  Could not cut him; we'd already shot too much with him (including one crucial scene that we just couldn't shoot again).  We finally gave up and agreed to meet again when he returned.

While he was on vacation he called everyone on the crew and cast and told them that I had decided to cancel the production altogether and work on something new that he had written.  All but 2 believed him; they met at his house and he offered to pay them (they were only volunteering for me) to work on his script.  When I ""didn't show up"" (wasn't invited) he told them that I had dropped out, how terrible of me.

The 2 who refused him let me know what was going on.  I tried calling back my crew and cast - they all said ""Sorry, we're actually making money up front with this.""  One of them even told me that I was a bitch for ""dropping out of his production without warning"".  She said the Brat had warned them that I would lie and try to get them to ""turn against him"".

I have a full-time job; he doesn't - he can dedicate all the time in the world to his script.  Local restaurants have been catering his shooting days, with the exact same deal I'd offered before.  The exact same restaurants that told me NO.  He also called the local college and got them to give students credit for helping on his production (did I mention the school library is named after his grandfather?).  So he has access to equipment I can't even dream of.  

And now, the cherry on the crap sundae:  The local theater has agreed to host his Big Premiere.  With the exact same deal I'd offered that they'd turned down.  Just read about it in the paper.

Sorry, I just had to rant.  I can't even finish my film.  I would have to start over again.  And everyone in a 100-mile radius with an ounce of talent is working for this guy now.  

**What did I learn?  Be very firm with contracts, and don't trust ANYONE.**

And yes, thanks to fantastic advice here, I'm writing this as a script.  Worked up a quick treatment last night but it got very dark very fast... think I need some time away from this situation before I can see the humor in it.  Not to mention that *everyone* would know exactly who these characters were based on...

[Also:  please understand that I'm not ""moping"".  I'm angry, I'm ranting, but I'm not just giving up.  I'm already planning another go at another script, it just burns me up that this happened.]"	t5_2r1ip	True

Your camera is only as good as the person holding it.  You will harm yourself as a filmmaker if you rely on gear to fix your shortcomings, because it won't work, you'll get frustrated, and give up before you have a chance to really spread your creative wings.

Spend as much of your free time as possible watching videos on how to be a better filmmaker.  Indy Mogul and Film Riot have some great tutorials, which I've used extensively.

The thing about high-end gear is that it's designed for people with high-end skills.  When you're starting out, a $500 glidecam, or a $1500 crane, or a $40,000+ Red package are not what you should be looking at.  You don't need a $3000 audio setup, nor do you need thousands of dollars worth of lighting.

That said, you do need three basic things:  A camera, a light kit, and a microphone.

The good news is: You can do a lot without a lot of money.

In this guide, I'm going to break down Cameras, light kits, and audio setups based on 3 different ""entry level"" budgets.  I rely heavily on DIY stuff, mostly PVC tinkering.  One thing to keep in mind is that none of the DIY gear is going to look professional.  You can paint anything matte black and get some amount of professionalism, but if you show up to a paying gig with a PVC stabilizer, you're going to have a bad time.

I'm intending this guide to be something we can link new people to, without a pretentious attitude, when they come asking what they should get.

Note: I ran into character limit, so I'm going to be doing each section as a comment.

Another note:  I'll admit I'm not really good with audio.  If anyone with better kit suggestions could do a similar writeup, I'd love to incorporate it into this post.  Try to keep every suggestion within the same budget restraints as my original suggestions, give or take 10%."	t5_2r1ip	True

1362951083.0	1a1kgr	Have you ever walked off of a set? (stories please)	freak55	149	16	156	"I never thought I would. But I did today:
Los Angeles, CA:

Met a kid my age (23ish) about a month ago. We talked about the industry and I mentioned that I am a recordist. He asked me to help out on a ""Student Film."" Now, I'm not a big shot, but I do make my way doing this stuff professionally. I remember doing student films in college and it was always a huge plus to have people on set with real experience. So I said i would help out, free of charge, as long as they rented their own mic/boom set up and fed me well.

Alarm 1: Yesterday I get a call early in the a.m. offering me money to come in since their sound guy bailed. I was busy, but had already committed to today's shoot. Told them no, but I would be there today.

Alarm 2: Never got a call sheet. Was told last night that it would be a 7am call (and we just changed the fucking clocks)

Alarm 3: I get to set and they have no equipment for me. I tell them I am leaving. They then produce the shittiest shotgun mic possible (not even sure what brand) and a ""mic-stand"" to use as my boom.

Alarm 4: No one working on this film is over the age of 17. Except one old dude (the ""Director""), who is the father of one of the kids.

Final Alarm: I told them I would not worry about getting paid as long as they ""feed me."" I arrive for  7am call and there is NO FOOD AND NO COFFEE.

So...I tried to use their equipment for about 2 shots. After the first location change, i took the director outside. Told him to attach their mic to their Mark-5 and record the audio directly to the camera. ""Because, I am leaving."" 

I feel bad for walking out, but its not my job to babysit kids with their daddy's gear for the day."	t5_2r1ip	True

I thought it would be great if we adopted this tradition but instead of self posts we dedicate each and every Sunday to showcasing films we have created or worked on. We could all give feedback, share tricks and techniques, and learn from each other. And the most up voted short every Sunday could be the ""winner"" in some respects. 

What are your thoughts? I think this could definitely bring the subreddit together for one day and truly make this a place for fellow filmmakers!

Granted, some things interest some of us more than others. For me, I'm not as much of a techie, so I'm less likely to get involved in a long discussion of lenses or cameras or grip gear (I know them because I have to - just not an interest). I would never vote a post like that down.

It seems even useful posts get downvotes. Someone posted that they were taking the DGA exam, and did anyone have any advice, and it got a downvote. Why? What did he do wrong? He or she is looking for feedback about something that influences his career. If you're not interested in the DGA or becoming an AD, fine, skip the post - why take the time to downvote?

I can see people downvoting something that was a complete waste of time, a bad joke, a link that is misleading in the title, etc. It just seems to me too many attempts to reach out for help or to share info in areas some aren't interested in are downvoted.

Here is what I propose:

Combine r/Filmmakers, r/filmmaking, and r/WeAreTheFilmMakers into one Filmmakers subreddit.

Combine r/directing and r/directors as the subject matter is very similar.

Combine r/ShortFilm and r/Shortfilms because they are almost identical.

Combine r/videography and r/videoproduction because they are the same kind of work, with slightly different names.

I think if we can combine these scattered subreddits we can have better content that is more centered on various subjects, and better help will be available to those who need it.

I don't know if there is an official way to request this to be done, but I have seen similar request posts in other places, so I thought I would give it a shot. Upvote if you agree, I guess.

###Flip Camera or Equivalent (~$200)

Most of them have a fixed lens, internal battery, and internal media.  Most record to H264 in 720 or 1080 video.  The quality of these cameras will be very low, and they will usually have little to no customizable options or settings.

Pros:

* Easy to use.  Turn on and record.
* Inexpensive.
* Small, good battery life.

Cons:

* Usually poor video quality
* No user settings
* Usually no inputs for audio or video.

###Canon T3i/600D

1080p is stellar for the price. Swivel screen, perfect for videographers who need extreme high or low angle shots, the ability to install Magic Lantern

Pros:

* swivel screen
* built in wireless flash trigger
* ACG disabled with no ML intervention
* ability for Magic Lantern to be installed (unlike the 7D)


Cons: 

* bad battery life when shooting video for long hours. (must use AC adapter or purchase) extra batteries
* not weather sealed

If you get this camera, you should get it at Amazon for a price of about $~750. However, if you get the money, you should at least upgrade to the f/1.8 50 prime.  

I recommend all people who primarily shoot video to get this camera instad of the T2i, 60D or the 7D

###Canon 7D ($1,699) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/646908-REG/Canon_3814B004_EOS_7D_SLR_Digital.html)

Smaller and cheaper than the 5D.  The buttons are a little more user friendly for video work as well.  Has 720p/60 that you can conform for slow motion, and has a higher quality HDMI output for external monitors.  The camera is great for shorts, music videos, commercials, and web.  NOW ACCEPTS MAGIC LANTERN FIRMWARE.

Pros:

* Shallow DoF
* 1080 24p
* 60fps over crank.
* Weather proofed body.
* Can accept hundreds of EF mount lenses

Cons:

* Can overheat fairly easily, even indoors. 
* No pro audio inputs, nearly worthless onboard mic.
* APS-C sensor.  This could be seen as a pro depending on your aesthetic and lenses.
* No clean HDMI output.
* Moire, line skipping, fairly low resolution image (not quite 1080)

#####Required accessories: EF Lenses, [Extra batteries](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/590459-REG/Canon_3347B001_LP_E6_Rechargeable_Lithium_Ion_Battery.html), [High speed CF Cards](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/646867-REG/SanDisk_SDCFX_016G_A61_16GB_Extreme_CompactFlash_Memory.html), CF card reader

Pros:

###Panasonic HPX170 ($3,395.00 without media) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/751649-REG/Panasonic_AGHPX170PJ_AG_HPX170_P2HD_Solid_State_Camcorder.html)

Little brother to the hugely popular HVX200, and has many improvements.  Records 480, 720, and 1080 video at multiple frame rates and speeds.  P2 card prices have plummeted, Panasonic will release an adapter to allow for the use of SD cards.  P2 workflow is well established and user friendly.  3 CCDs = no moire or rolling shutter.  Great for events, weddings, sports, shorts, and music videos.  Very versatile camera.

Pros:

* XLR inputs, several video outputs.
* Over and undercrank speeds
* Buttons are user friendly for on the fly shooting.
* Long battery life

Cons:

* Small sensor, deep DoF (this could be a pro, depending on the use and type of shoot)
* Codec is starting to show its age, but holds up well for most uses.  
* Not necessarily a con, but this is a video camera, and the footage will reflect this.

#####Required accessories: P2 cards, P2 card reader, additional batteries
#####Recommended accessories: HD on-board monitor

###Canon XF100 ($3000) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/733533-REG/Canon_4888B001_XF100_HD_Professional_Camcorder.html)

Relatively low cost broadcast-ready camcorder. Full featured and compact. Good for budget on-the-go video work, documentary, and tiny-crew single-camera production. Less hassle than a DSLR setup at the expense of DSLR's super-shallow depth of field. Easy to switch between manual and full automatic shooting modes in chaotic environments. Built in ND filters.

Pros:

* Good range of bitrates and resolutions with support for slow and fast motion, interval recording, and frame recording when in 24p mode. Up to 60p at 720, 60i at 1080.
* 4:2:2 codec and Canon processor create smooth, natural skin tones and texture even under harsh or unusual lighting.
* Two XLR ports with excellent preamps and independent controls. Built in stereo mics are above-average for on-camera microphones.


Cons:

* Single lens.
* Smaller sensor means deeper depth of field than is currently in vogue.
* Compatible CF cards are costly per GB and the camera does not (to my knowledge) support off-board recording, limiting recording time at higher bitrates.

The spiritual successor to the DVX-100, HVX-200, HPX-170 but with a large sensor twist. 4/3 sensor for a DSLR like look, but far less moire, rolling shutter and compression issues. 1080p 60 VFR, dual card SD slots and SDI output.  Definitely an improvement over DSLRs, but maybe not the best mid-range option IMO.  AVCHD Codec.

Pros:

* Video camera features and controls
* Large sensor
* SDI out

Cons:

* Highlights clip yellow
* Micro 4/3 lenses and crop factor leave much to be desired.

#####Required accessories: Lenses, Batteries, SD Media

#####Recommended accessories: SDI recorder, non-4/3 glass and adapter, mid-sized shoulder rig/sticks.

A video camera that grew up with DSLRs and learned from their mistakes. An affordable way to get the large sensor look without the compromises of a DSLR. Great low light performance, highlights clip better than most. 

E-mount is easily adapted. 1080p up to 60fps, clean 4:2:2 HDMI out. The camera his its limitations but it's a huge step up from shooting DSLR and IMO a much better experience than the Panasonic AF100.  AVCHD codec.


Pros: 

* Shares Exmor Super35 sensor with F3 
* Video camera features and controls 
* Small and light


Cons: 

* No SDI 
* No Built-in ND filters

High quality 4k Raw Digital cinema camera &amp; 5k stills.  Same sensor as the Red Epic-X Available with EF and PL mounts, as well as 3rd party nikon mounts.  Lots of resolution and frame rate options.  13.5 stops of dymanic range.  High quality components, cinema quality image.  Great for shorts, commercials, music videos.  Not great for live broadcasts, sports, and run and gun shoots.

Pros:

* 4k raw motion, 5k stills
* Extremely customizable packages
* Edit raw 4k files in adobe premiere

Cons:

* Data heavy.  64 GB cards hold ~24 minutes of footage (more if you lower the quality and resolution)
* Power hungry.  You'll want bricks on the back.  RedVolts last around 25 minutes.
* Heavy.  Once you get it all rigged up, you'll want a good shoulder mount and tripod.

Lacks moire aliasing rolling shutter many of which plague its lower priced rivals. Include two XLR ports built in ND filters and a great 422 8 bit 50mb/s xf codec. It uses Canon log setting which has a flat color and gamma curve for color correcting. The low ISO performance is excellent going to a reasonable 20,000 iso. Base ISO is 850. Physically the camera has two XLR ports a great LCD and viewfinder. Great doc camera and not a bad on the run and gun narrative camera. Comes in both EF and PL mount.


Pros 

* Picture Quality 
* Ergonomics 
* Ef and Pl mount 
* Good Battery Life


Cons 

* No RAW 
* Only ""422"" 8 bit. 
* 60fps only 720p

I love Reddit but we need to be conscious that by submitting our ideas/concepts on Reddit we submit to Reddit's terms of service which include clauses that Conde Naste is free to use our concepts/text for their own commercial purposes.

-------------------
**Original Post**

I know there is already a thread about Redditors making a movie in terms of a collaborative effort, but what I would like to do is different.  I want to create a Reddit movie, from beginning to end, using paid industry professionals where possible.  When I mean beginning, I mean:

Stage 1 - **Fund Raising Round 1 - Development**

- Initial outreach to Reddit community to raise basic funding for Development phase.  Funding goals should be to raise funds to pay for a screenplay and a few industry people to assist with advising and helping manage funding requirements and plan.

Stage 2 - **Development**

- Hold a well managed screenwriting contest, complete with payment for the winning script
- Use aforementioned paid professionals to help develop funding requirements based on selected script

Stage 3 - **Fund Raising Round 2 - Pre-Production**

* With selected script, and funding requirements in hand, have second round of crowd-sourced funding from Reddit community.  Complete with Kickstarter-esque incentives for contributors


Stage 3 - **Pre-Production**

* Funding in place, commence with pre-production activities.  I won't go into details since we all know what this entails.  While the funding is crowd-sourced, the work will be handled by actual industry professionals.  We will have to work out as a community how these professionals are selected and agreed upon to ensure this reflects an overall Redditor effort.
* We can use the community as a whole where possible to assist with things such as: storyboarding, location scouting, etc.  The idea being that the pre-production is transparent and open.
* For casting we could try to work with Reddit favorites willing to take a risk  but also receiving payment for their work

Stage 4 - **Fund Raising Round 3 - Production**

* Using the funding requirements created in Pre-Production, solicit funding from the Reddit community to fund production

Stage 5 - **Production &amp; Post Production**

* Again, I won't go into all the details of how a movie is made here, but the idea should be, where possible, things are kept open and transparent to the broader community.  If possible, dailies should be uploaded as well as additional information (interviews with cast, directors, etc) to keep everyone informed of what's happening with the movie.

Stage 6 - **Fund Raising Round 4 - Marketing/Distro**

* Raise funds required to properly market and distribute the film. 

Stage 7 - **Marketing/Distro**

* This is where I think we can be more original.  There could be lots of interesting ways for the movie to be marketed and distributed.. online or traditional.  Since the movie is crowd-funded, we need to determine the profit motivation.  Since by this time, the movie will have been entirely funded by the community, do we attempt to return money to the contributors?  Do we use any profits at this point to fund future movies?  Do we release the movie effectively free?  Of course this brings up interesting points about cast pay based on the movie's performance.  Thoughts on this?

Side Project - **Side Documentary on Crowd Sourced Movie**

* We should raise money to pay for a documentary crew to film/document the entire process, end to end.  Showing people how the movie was made, struggles endured and the ending result.  This way we come out with two films during this process.


What do you guys think? Is this something we could pull off?  We all know the power of crowdsourcing funds.  Just look at what happened with Veronica Mars.  Why shouldn't we have a Reddit Film Company where WE can professionally produce the films WE select. No need to fight Hollywood, let's try to work with the professionals there to produce high quality, crowd sourced content in an open manner.  All it takes is a few dollars from a fraction of the Reddit community to make this happen.  It would be a huge shift in the way movies will be produced in the future.  

Do you guys want to be a part of this or will some other web community do this first?  Let me hear your thoughts.  Just think of how once we get the ball rolling, the PR from this would make it almost self sustaining.  Even if the movie doesn't win Oscars, the fact that one online community could fund and produce and release a professional, feature length film would be astounding.

I've been busting my ass for a company that undersold me and demanded everything. I provided top quality production editing and animated videos. 

The issue arose when I was asked to shoot a presentation and I shot it to the best of my abilities. The conditions where terrible, and was easily a required 2 or 3 camera job - not 1. 

Found out early this week that my work, I service I provided was not to the level of satisfaction of the client. May I note, this job was performed 4 months ago. There was little to no communication to the level of the clients dissatisfaction. 

I was instructed that I will have to forfeit my, lack for a better word, shit pay of $250 because it was my fault for the lack of organization and overall end result. I put 2 days of work, not to mention, travel to another city for a measly $250 and they wanted to rip it from my hands. 

I said no, I provided a service and regardless of what transpired it was not my obligation to return the little money I earned. 

I was fired for my response. 

The thing that bothers me about low-end, ""experience"" type jobs, is they consistently rape and remove all hope of ever doing it for the art. 

All in all, it was a pretty average day as a freelance filmmaker...

Qualifying that you finished your short in five minutes does you a disservice, it suggests that you didn't care enough about the product to put the proper amount of effort into it. It suggests you know the product has problems and are using the fact that you rushed it out as an excuse. But why rush it when there are no deadlines, no release dates to hit?

The obvious exception to this is film races of varying amounts of time (24, 48, 5 day, etc) which force you to sacrifice quality to make a product as quickly as possible.

As should be apparent by now, this is a rambling rant with no particular beginning, middle, or end (perhaps I should've put more time into it), but walk away with the knowledge that you should spend the time to get your project right, then move onto the next one."	t5_2r1ip	True

I think it would be a good idea to bring this small community of filmmakers together, doing something we are all passionate about: filmmaking. It would be a good chance for amateur filmmakers to hone their skills, create discussion with the pros, and have a reward for the filmmakers who do great work.

We can start it off by having the announcement for this month's theme, conditions, and deadline. Then we get to work, making a short film that meets the theme and conditions by the deadline. Submissions are given to the mods or a body of judges who then choose the winners in different categories- best cinematography, best acting, best screenplay, best visual effects, etc. The winners get a tag next to their name, maybe 'MotM Winner' or something like that.

Is this a good idea? It seems most appropriate to this subreddit. I have a feeling it could create some more filmmaking related discussion and a tighter community if we did... And it really doesn't require much more than moderating a few times a month.

Thoughts? Feedback?

EDIT: It would help make this tons more official and worth it if we actually got a mod of this subreddit behind the idea or something... To make the theme/conditions post and winners post for each month and maybe get some info in the sidebar or something. This idea will die quickly without moderator support.

EDIT 2: Thank you guys for the support. We are working on getting something up soon!"	t5_2r1ip	True

Stevenup7002	104	10	46	"**EDIT:** If you like what I'm doing and want to be updated when any new tracks are released, I recommend you follow me on Soundcloud, or subscribe to my [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/stevenobriencomposer) for future updates. For those of you that have generously expressed an interest in donating to me, you can find more information on [my website](http://www.steven-obrien.net/?p=donate)

------------------------------------

My name is Steven O'Brien and I'm a composer of contemporary classical music, mainly for piano. I'm now offering free use of any of my music for your film projects, under the single condition that credit is given (I'm unfortunately quite low on cash, so I'm hoping that a little exposure will help to sell a few albums or attract a few donations).

My music is freshly written, entirely original and composed to a very high standard, so if you're looking for high quality stock music that has not previously been used elsewhere, or wish to use tracks of differing moods but still retain a certain stylistic cohesiveness, you should definitely check out my portfolio. I release all of my music under a Creative Commons license.

Tracks are downloadable in a high quality, lossless FLAC format from my Soundcloud profile: http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien




**Here are the tracks I recommend the most:**


[A set of twenty four preludes](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/twenty-four-preludes-op-2/), ranging in lengths from 0:30 to 3:00, with two reaching 5:00 and 7:00 in length. In a way, most of these resemble still images captured in audio, so they would be perfect for scenes that require a certain sense of reflection. Their moods range from the child-like simplicity and calmness of Nos. 1, 11, 19, 21 and 23, to the doubt filled anxieties of Nos. 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 20, 22 and 24, to the jollity of Nos. 3, 7, 13, 15 and 17, to the downright depressive reflections of Nos. 5, 6, 12, 16 and 18. These preludes, in my opinion, are perfect for any film that requires the expression of a wide range of strong emotions. My personal favorites are [1](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-in-c-major), [21](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-21-in-b-flat-major), [8](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-8-in-f-minor-op-2h), [9](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-9-in-e-major-op-2i), [11](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-11-in-b-major-op-2k) and [23](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-23-in-f-major-op-2w).

[Romances, Op. 4](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/romances-op-4/). A work in progress, so check back in the future for further uploads (I hope to write about 8 of these). These romances  mainly contain the qualities of joy and contentedness with one's situation.

Piano Sonatas Nos. [1](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/piano-sonata-no-1-in-f-minor/), [2](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/piano-sonata-no-2-in-f-major/), [3](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/piano-sonata-no-3-in-d-major/) and [4](http://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/sets/piano-sonata-no-4-in-a-major/). These works are very classically constructed, with the tracks ranging from lengths of 2:30 to 9:00. They contain a similarly wide palette of emotions compared to the Twenty Four Preludes, but with a much more dramatically driven and structured tone.





If you require WAVs, MP3s or my music in any other format, have questions regarding the use of my music, need advice regarding the use of certain tracks, feel free to contact me at steven@steven-obrien.net, I'll be happy to assist you.


Also, while certainly not neccessary, if you do plan on using one of my tracks in your project, I'd be absolutely delighted to hear from you.


I also offer services for writing original film music (with instrumentations including piano, chamber, orchestral, choral etc.), please contact me at the above address if you are interested in this service.


Thanks, I hope you enjoy my music and I look forward to seeing what you do with it!

1369999756.0	1fecd3	Buzzfeed has used clips of my short film trailer in a video without my permission. Can/should I do anything about it?	nashx90	106	11	42	"Hi.

BuzzFeed's BuzzFeedYellow channel uploaded a video couple of days ago, about [life in your 20s vs life in your 30s.](http://youtu.be/ufTy_ta5Bas) Within the video there are two clips (visible at 0:54 and 1:26) from [a trailer for a short film](https://vimeo.com/61217386) I made a few months ago. I only found out about it because one of the actors' friends told him that he was in a Buzzfeed video.

For trailers, should I expect to be notified when people use clips and footage from it in completely separate works? Should I not expect to have to at least give permission? Naturally I'm flattered that somehow my stuff has been kinda-almost-briefly viewed half a million times, but surely I ought to have a say in whether or not this goes ahead or not?

Basically, I'm not sure whether I should be annoyed by this or not.

(Auxilliary question: is there any graceful way to put this on my resume, heh?)

EDIT: Yeah, looks like I initially gave the trailer a CC Attribution license, and they did indeed link to the trailer in the Youtube video description. Doubtful I can do much about it at this point, and I guess it's not really doing any harm. Thanks a lot for the comments, though, glad to hear there's a few avenues of recourse for when/if I get properly rumbled in future.

EDIT 2: The guy at Buzzfeed who edited the video, Bobby Miller, messaged me about it and has updated the video description with a fuller attribution of my work. I'm happy now :)."	t5_2r1ip	True

In the sea of film making communities out there, I find it hard to actually connect with film makers and directors and build any kind of rapport needed to create a professional relationship due to:

- Too many amateur composers looking to write music for free, so I get lost in the crowd
- Most interaction is done online, so its difficult to connect with someone
- Difficult to find people who are currently looking for composers

I have a couple of questions I was wondering you might be able to answer for me:

- Where are the best places to hook up with film makers looking for music?
- Where do you guys usually go to when you're looking for customised music - or what terms do you search google for?
- Any other tips?

###Canon T2i/550D ($550) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/675617-REG/Canon_4462B001_Canon_EOS_Rebel_T2i.html)

Same sensor as the 7D, T3i, 60D.  Entry level, consumer camera.  Shoots on SD cards.

Pros:

* Inexpensive
* 1080 24p, 30p, 720 60p for overcranking
* Magic Lantern hackable.

Cons:

* No sensor to turn off LCD screen
* No flip out screen
* No weather sealing, plastic body

Canon APS-C camera (1100D, 550D, 600D, 60D, 7D) all have the same sensor and so all share similar image quality, moire and ISO performance

-----
###Canon T3i/600D ($618) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/753760-REG/Canon_5169B001_EOS_Rebel_T3i_Digital.html)

###Canon 7D ($1,699) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/646908-REG/Canon_3814B004_EOS_7D_SLR_Digital.html)

Smaller and cheaper than the 5D.  The buttons are a little more user friendly for video work as well.  Has 720p/60 that you can conform for slow motion, and has a higher quality HDMI output for external monitors.  The camera is great for shorts, music videos, commercials, and web.  APS-C Sensor.

Pros:

* 1080 24p &amp; 30p
* 60fps over crank (720p)
* Weather proofed body.

* No pro audio inputs, nearly worthless onboard mic.
* No clean HDMI output.
* Moire, line skipping, fairly low resolution image (not quite 1080)

###Canon 5D m2 ($2,199) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/583953-REG/Canon_2764B003_EOS_5D_Mark_II.html)

The camera that started the DSLR revolution.  Full frame sensor gives a different look than the cropped APS-C sensor cameras.  Depth of field is shallower, and ISO can go higher with less noise.  Has a 3"" LCD display.  Shoots on CF cards.

Pros:

* Weather/dust proof body
* Full frame sensor (not necessarily a pro, but it's a feature some people like a lot)
* Better in low light than 7D, 60D, t3i
* Runs cooler than the 7D, doesn't overheat as easily.
* Can install Magic Lantern
* Producers are used to this model and might hire someone who owns it (or a 7D) over the other Canon DSLRs.

Cons:

* No 720p 60fps option
* Buttons and menus aren't as user friendly as a 7D
* HDMI output drops to SD when you record

-----

###Canon 5d m3 ($3,500) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/847545-REG/Canon_5260A002_EOS_5D_Mark_III.html)

A decent upgrade to the 5D m2.  Full frame sensor, 3.2"" LCD screen.

Pros:

* Better low light sensitivity than the 5Dm2.  
* Reduced moire and rolling shutter
* Dual CF and SD card slots
* High quality, sturdy body

Cons:

* At this price, it's getting close to competitive video cameras that will out perform it in certain areas.

-----

###Panasonic GH2 ($900 w/ kit lens) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/736365-REG/Panasonic_DMC_GH2K_K_Lumix_DMC_GH2_Digital_Camera.html)

Somewhat of a hidden gem.  The GH2 can be hacked and upgraded to produce video that rivals cameras 4x its price.  It has a micro 4/3 sensor (1.89 crop factor), 3"" LCD, and touch screen control.  AVCHD codec.  Can adapt popular lenses to fit the camera body.

Pros:

* Hackable.  Can increase bit rate for high quality video.
* 1080 24p, 1080 60i
* Less aliasing and moire than similarly priced cameras.  
* crop mode (crops imaging area of sensor to the center 1920x1080 pixels, effectively a digital zoom without a resolution drop)
* AVCHD or Motion JPEG codec
* Higher native resolution than Canon DSLRs. Roughly 900 lines of sensor data (like the Sony EX1/EX3), compared to the ~700 lines found on Canon DSLRs.
* Live onscreen histogram.

Cons:

* Will need an adapter to use Canon or Nikon lenses.  If you use electronically controlled Canon lenses, you have to set the aperture on a Canon  body before putting it on your GH2.  Or get an adapter with a built in iris.
* smaller sensor results in a 2x crop, meaning slightly deeper DOF and fewer wide angle options (maybe not a con to everybody)
* falloff from whites tends to be more abrupt
* Slower sensor refresh rate; rolling shutter is slightly worse than Canon DSLRs.
* Menu layout is somewhat unlogical.
* Not weather sealed.
* Green cast in footage

###Nikon D7000 ($1,500 with kit lens) [link](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/735300-REG/Nikon_25474_D7000_DSLR_Camera_Kit.html)

Nikons take at a mid-range video DSLR. Has the ability to plug in an external mic (3.5mm) and the auto gain controls are actually workable. You can put 2 SD cards in at the same time. Favours well light conditions

Pros:

* Nice range of Nikon lenses
* Weather proof
* Can use 2 SD cards at the same time
* Very good low light performance


Cons:

* While in Live View you can't change the aperture in manual movie mode
* Doesn't like high contrast, back light situations. (Can get muddy easily)
* Data rate averages at about 20mbps

###Sony NEX-5  ([$598 body](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/817852-REG/Sony_NEX_5N_B_NEX_5N_Digital_Camera_Body.html)) ([$698 with kit lens](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/817850-REG/Sony_NEX_5NK_B_NEX_5N_Digital_Camera_with.html))


1080p video on par with Canon T2i, 7D etc. 1080p frame rates up to 60fps for slow motion and down to 4fps for video-timelapse. AVCHD v2 codec. Focus peaking; in-camera lens distortion correction for video; articulating LCD.


Pros:

* Slow motion from 1080p60 video
* Smaller and lighter than DSLRs
* HDMI-out stays at 1080p 16:9 even during recording
* Accepts almost any lens via adapter
* Less moire and aliasing than similar priced Canon DSLRs (especially in slow mo 60p)
* Stepless aperture lenses for smooth autoexposure ramping
* Silent autofocus; touch-screen AF tracking


Cons: 

* No microphone input.
* Unique/ugly noise characteristic at ISO 3200 if underexposed
* No way to get a properly flat 'log' picture profile
* Video files not supported by most NLE software at present
* High compression/low bitrate sometimes results in banding in dark scenes
* Small camera bottom makes it hard to get a solid mounting to QR plates as there's only a small area to provide friction

* [Here's a Reddit link in this sub for some guys short film, '2 Hours'](http://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/10ozcm/2_hours_a_postapocalyptic_short_film_created_on_a/)... it got an unusual number of upvotes and positive comments... while decently done, it's just another in the sea of apocalypse/zombie vids... so...
* [Here's the makers Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/2HoursTheMovie) where he asks his supporters ""***Attention redditors, we've posted the film to a few subreddits. If you liked the film, help us out by upvoting and commenting.***""
* and [here's someone posting as a friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/zombies/comments/10p08i/2_hours_hands_down_the_best_amateur_zombie_film_i/) under the title "" *'2 Hours' Hands down the best amateur Zombie Film I have seen.*"" ([and posted 3 more times](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jugemu/submitted/))
* [and the here's the maker in various subs, ongoing](http://www.reddit.com/user/2hoursthemovie/submitted/)... odd titles like ""*2 HOURS ― A Beautifully Artistic Approach to a Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Film, Created without a Budget.*""... 
* [and here's someone else posting it](http://www.reddit.com/user/happyvalleyjosh), talking like a creator, with a [seemingly uninvolved question](http://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/10p06b/2_hours_a_postapocalyptic_short_film_created_on_a/c6fd53c) from the [friend above](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jugemu) who posted it 4 times already...

* and so on...

Personally this annoys me, feels like biased advertising. (and telling your facebook fans ""*If you liked the film then...*"" is preaching to the choir). Multilple posters are connected, but it's unclear how. The titles sometimes make it seem like they've just found something cool, rather than promoting their own work. 

IMHO, submissions are supposed to be raised and buried on their own merit, with this happening we see the selection as chosen by the people spending the most time on social media...

How do you feel about people doing this?

***EDIT SUMMARY and postscript***: after spending more time and drinking more beers than I should, here's info: 

* A to-date summary-ish of opinion: 50% of people don't like any form of vote/comment-rigging, 50% think it's all part of the game, and 50% don't care at all...
* The filmmakers themselves turned up: seem nice (EDIT2: oooh, [maybe not](http://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/10ozcm/2_hours_a_postapocalyptic_short_film_created_on_a/c6fvyii)... ""*Maybe it's cause we have a dedicated fanbase asshole*""), didn't support the pretend parts (maybe some supporters got overenthusiastic)... now I feel guilty. Fortunately, beer/senility will fix that. G'night :)"	t5_2r1ip	True
1347805118.0	zyz33	Reddit Film Production Company [LA]	DeepFriedDonkeyDick	109	24	94	"Hey guys!
        I was one of the attendee at the last Reddit Entertainment Mixer.  A great idea that went around at the end of the night was that we sign up for an email list with our specialties in hopes of gathering together to put our talents together and form a Reddit Film Production crew. 

I am definitely all for it!  To my recollection, nothing has been done about it thus far.  Please, no one take offence to this, I am not trying to step on anyone's toes or accuse anyone of anything.  I am merely stepping up and saying that I want something to happen and I am serious about putting my talents to use with the other amazingly talented and driven people of our niche group.  I definitely met some awesome characters that night and overheard many great stories.

I am serious about this.  I am willing to put all of my free time and talents on the line to see this thing through!  I can edit/act/write/direct and I will use everything at my disposal to help build this group up. 

 I would much rather prefer to work with Redditors because that sense of humor and understanding is shared more so commonly us and we could very easily create new content in brainstorming sessions. 

My vision for all of this is to not settle for some small time production.  I believe that we could build up to having a legit run business that can stand on its own!  Some of you have great connections to the entertainment industry that could help us produce, fund, get us in the room with executives.  We can tackle this two fold, buy creating content and uploading it to our youtube channel and build a fan base, while also taking scripts and pilots to agents/producers/execs to help give us an edge to get our foot in.

To put this straight out, I'm just a kid that believes in something far bigger than settling for mediocre, I just have lots of crazy ideas that need to burst out of my head, and I know a lot of you do too. Judging my some of the posts and comments, we are in no short supply of wit and humor and insightful thoughts.  All I have right now are my talents, ideas, and time, and drive.  And I am looking for those few that are willing to put in their passion as well and see this through. It does take WORK, but no one says we can't make it fun as well.

I also know we need to come together as a group, share our ideas, agree and disagree on them collectively and respectfully as adults for things to work out, and I am all for that! 

I have NO clue yet as to where this meet up will take place or when.  I just wanted to throw this out here to see how many of you are serious enough to make this happen! Then we can proceed and schedule a fun meet and greet, nothing strict at first, and from there we get an email list with everyone’s talents listed so we can schedule the first real brainstorming sessions.  I have a pilot for a tv show that I have in mind, but we need lots more content and ideas to see where we can take this.

So to end my rant, I know there is a HUGE potential here, and I for one want to see it manifest. We need writers, actors, camera men, singers, comedians, producers, directors, artists of all sorts, and Jewish people.  The whole gambit!

Please let me know of any thoughts/concerns/late night drive by t-bagging stories and let’s make this happen!

I will also be submitting this same post and link to this meetup to several of Reddit's entertainment subreddits to see the responses.

Thank you all! Cheers

TL:DR GOOBY PLS


Edit:  Everyone who wants to pitch in, please me email at

so that I may start compiling a mailing list so that I can contact you all a lot easier and set up our first meeting.

1375909115.0	1jwrfs	What you all should know about the booming Film Industry in Louisiana that most people don't...	wildlikechildren	92	8	98	"I mentioned Louisiana being a good place to jump into the industry a couple times in other posts and most had no clue or thought I was joking. I thought I'd take the time to give you all a little insight to what kind of opportunity is here.  

My Personal little story: After working on TV and commercials in Florida I picked up and moved to Louisiana for a possible opportunity to work on a feature film. I didn't know a soul. I cold called production offices from production reports and eventually landed a day playing position in the production office of a big budget show. After a couple of days working in the office I asked if a couple of the other Office PA's wanted to go for drinks, telling them a round was on me and they agreed. They are now my closest and dearest friends I have to this day and were a crucial part in helping me make the appropriate contacts I needed to keep working. I haven't really stopped working since. 

What you need to know:

There's a lot that I could tell you but all in all, if you want to work on big budget feature films that are backed by studios then Louisiana is the place to be. Louisiana has some of the top tax incentives for film and video production and is currently #3 in the US for production behind NYC and California. Yes, #3. Recently the Louisiana government threatened to take our tax incentives away in order to fill a deficit in the state budget.  We (The Louisiana Film and Entertainment Association) fought tooth and nail to keep the industry alive and we won, locking in another 5 years of booming film industry. Because of this, Fox is now considering to put a permanent hub for production in Louisiana. 

[Check out one of our PSA's to keep the industry alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Q9Bi_h8BA)

New Orleans and Baton Rouge are the 2 main hubs.  New Orleans has a lot more productions working there but Baton Rouge brings in the massive ones such as Oblivion, Battleship, GI Joe, and the recently signed, upcoming Fantastic 4 Reboot. Baton Rouge has Celtic which is owned by Raleigh Studios containing 5 large warehouses/sound stages complete with buildings serving as production offices.  New Orleans has more resources considering most rental companies such as Hollywood Trucks, VER, Panavision and more are based out of New Orleans. New Orleans is also a whole lot more enticing for producers and actors. 

* Shows recently filmed/Shows in Production/Slated to film in Louisiana:

Left Behind, Search Party, Maze Runner, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Focus, Bonnie and Clyde, Untitled James Wan Thriller, Selfless, 22 Jump Street, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Jurassic Park 4, Fantastic 4 Reboot, GeoStorm, Ravenswood, Sons of Guns, Pit-bulls and Paroles, Duck Dynasty, Swamp People, The Butler, The Occult  and more

* Shows that were filmed in Louisiana:

Oblivions, Pawn Shop Chronicles, The Iceman, Now You See Me, The Campaign, The East, Beautiful Creatures, The Host, Twilight, This Is The End, Battle: Los Angeles, Jonah Hex, Youth in Revolt, Django Unchained, The Road, Pitch Perfect, Battleship, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Haunting in Connecticut, Olympus Has Fallen, G. I. Joe: Retaliation, Looper, Jeff Who Lives at Home and more




So there's a little picture of what kind of shows are here and have been here. Those are mostly just off the top of my head from having worked here, knowing people on them and hearing about them. If you were to move here and you really work at it you wouldn't have a problem finding work what-so-ever, especially if you have prior experience or training. It is a right to work state so you don't have to be union to work on a union crew.  I know the feeling of frustration in wanting to work but not knowing where to turn or where to go or how to do it so If you all have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

We did finish it. It took us months of working non-stop. The thought of giving up never occurred to us.

We had our screening party and celebrated. Everybody loved it. The main character/actor was the hit of the film.

I'm very glad we got to share that moment with him. He recently, unexpectedly and tragically passed away at the age of 27. I hate to think of how terrible I would feel if we never had the chance to show him the finished project, and share those memories with him.

Please, please, for the sake of everyone involved, finish your project. If you have one that you haven't worked on in a while, no matter how bad you think it is, FINISH IT.

Those memories are worth it and I hate to think of the painful regret anyone would feel if they tragically missed the chance to share it with those involved.

There is a special bond between filmmaker and subject. Cherish it, and respect it.

RIP Morgan McDonald. You were the best dude ever.

1375813333.0	1jts21	Can we have a little discussion about craigslist for a second? There are other options out there.	wildlikechildren	81	8	22	"As we all know Craigslist is unfortunately a go-to for a lot of things. Wether it be to sell a bike, find a roommate or to look up film gigs in the area. Some transactions are great and some will just leave you with a little more dislike for the human race.

Let me just start off by saying that these gigs (particularly the ones asking for free help) are the kind of shows/gigs you don't want to be working for; at least shows that meet the industry standard that is. No decent show with a real budget and a real production manager overseeing it with all appropriate departments involved are not going to even dare look into the depths of craigslist for hiring. They are going to hire the people they know or go through legitimate production sites. If they are having to lure you in with ""WORK IN HOLLYWOOD"" or with words like ""amazing, credible, structured, reputable, highly competitive"" then I can guarantee you they are none of those things. 


Having worked on shows where I'm hiring office PA's or collecting resumes for the AD's when they get into town I can tell you where I've gone to and have pulled from. There have also been times where in the middle of the show a department will need a PA to help them wrap out or assist for a couple weeks (editorial, accounting, costumes) and not knowing anyone local, I turn to these resources. 

1) Facebook groups dedicated to the local film industry. These are EXTREMELY helpful in gathering people. There are always others posting about new shows coming to town or asking for Day Players ASAP. Starting out I landed a day playing job on a Discovery reality show and ended up being hired full time. 

2) Local Film Commission directories, facebook pages and websites. I will either look in the directory for a specific position or talk to the Film Commission and have our production email added for resumes to be sent in. 

3) I personally haven't used these to hire but I've gotten calls from other production companies using the following sites. Calls from ESPN, Traveling Documentaries and the likes

Craigslist is helpful in many ways and I'm sure you'd be able to meet great people in the same position you are but (In my humble opinion) unless you're a student, helping out a friend on a short film, or owe someone a favor there's no real reason why you shouldn't be getting paid. People can't seem to realize that what we do takes skill. If you were a skilled carpenter, you wouldn't reply to a craigslist post asking you to come help build their house for free right? all in the name of meeting other carpenters? No. I understand this is a different industry to compare others to but just be smart guys. There's other resources out there for you to use than just craigslist. "	t5_2r1ip	True

I have been reading up, just looking for opinions/strategies.  Realistically, there's seems to be no point in chasing theatrical distribution for your first film, or for any indie film for that matter...  And the film festival route seems to be an expensive risk.  The chances of getting picked are up are very low, and if you do, the chances of getting a good deal are very low.  And the old way where you look at it as a stepping stone to get paid on the next one seems less realistic these days.

Is self distribution/direct to streaming/Netflix/et al the best way?

Since I've identified a few of these clichés I've been starting to see them everywhere, even in my past films.


My list of clichés I've noticed are:


-Extreme close up of an eye

-Someone looking at themselves in a mirror

-A film starting with the alarm clock sounding and a person in their morning routine

-Gas masks

I found out about it just a few hours before it started. I ran up there as soon as I got off of work. I walked in and didn't see him. I felt disappointed for just a moment until I realized there was a staircase. I went up and turned a corner and there he was... an Icon and my hero! He looked amazing. It was like George Washington stepped off of a dollar bill and was standing in front of me. I didn't have the idea for the tattoo until about 30 seconds before he talked to me. I had that marker in my pocket from work and I touched it and the thought popped into my head. An hour later I was in the tattoo parlor. It was all a blur. It was fantastic! I will never forget it.

1357745425.0	1692t7	Things to think about (and avoid) in your DP Reel	JBFirelotus	74	11	25	"I'm producing a decent-budgeted short in late Spring, and I'm looking at DP reels. A few things strike me even in reels by people with a decent number of credits.

1. Forgiving doesn't mean well-lit.

For years, cinematographers were able to light night scenes - exteriors and interiors -where you could actually make out faces and details. It's a skill, and one that many seem to have forgotten in the digital age. I can't tell you how many night interior scenes I find myself squinting on.  - again, on reels from DPs with some level of credits. It's like on old TVs when you wanted to turn up the brightness.

Yeah, I GET that it's night - don't be lazy just because digital is forgiving enough that I can make out the people - it looks like Uncle Joe's home movies.

2. One harsh light. 

I want to put one of those warnings across every legitimate, classic noir - these people are professionals, don't try this at home, or on the 5D your mom bought you.

In an attempt to impress with their ""style"", every other scene has an interior scene with one harsh, white light coming through the window. The fact that I've almost never seen this happen in the real world - for one thing, people would get out of the glare - is only part of the problem. 

Mind you, if this is a music video and you are going for affect, have fun. I'm talking narrative here.


2A. If you are doing an alleyway scene, and, as someone with some degree of time on set, I can say ""oh, he put the (fill in large light) there,"" it doesn't work. I should not be aware of movie lights.


3. DO show me how you handle natural light.

Anyone who has seen a John Ford movie understands that working with natural light can be impressive. The DP reels I liked all showed something impressive with exteriors. I'm fine if they augmented natural light - but make it look good.

Digital does this well, but I fear that the lack of understanding of light needed with WYSIWYG monitors has made ""DPs"" out of people who are not first and foremost photographers.

4. More is not more.

I want to see variety. If you do one thing well, and you show it to me in every shot, I'm not impressed. 

Hey, I fully understand that on some shoots, you were limited by budget or a weak director or you were rushed. Better to leave that stuff out, because I'm assuming you are only putting your best out there.


I absolutely believe there are more good DPs out there today than ever. Sadly, ease has made room for more BAD DPs than ever, and it makes the selection process hard, unless I keep going back to the same people I know, which isnt really fair to directors who are looking for a wide range of choices.

I hope this gives aspiring DPs something to think about - and I look forward to what things other directors, producers, etc like and don't like in DP reels. Rather than being a rant about bad reels (yeah, there is a little of that, but, hey, I've had to look at a lot of stuff) I'd like to see the Reddit filmmakers community turn it into a place for good, honest, feedback.

BTW, I didn't include examples because I didn't want to unfairly seem to attack certain DPs."	t5_2r1ip	True

FredOnToast	72	7	41	"I have an opportunity to help out in the making of an independent feature film, that is filming locally, as a ""below the line"" role. Quite likely either 1st AD or PA, as I have no equipment but have more filming experience than the Director/Writer. It would be my third job in the industry after leaving education. 

Now I attended a read through of the script, and met some of the cast, and my gut feeling is that this film will likely be pretty bad. The script didn't make sense towards the end (it's a horror film) and the acting seemed rather poor, or at least their read through did. The title as well is extremely bland, but I won't be saying what it is here.

I also just found out that it is confirmed that an ""actor"" who is more famous for his personal life and generally poor sports career, has agreed to do a cameo. 

The question I bring to everyone here is, is it bad that I'm not at all enthusiastic about this film, and I'm not even sure if I should continue for the experience, even though bad experience can be valuable in learning what *not* to do? I would feel very guilty if I suddenly backed out (shooting is in 2 weeks), but I can't help but think that this could hold me back in the future if my name is attached to it.

**EDIT:**
I really appreciate all the responses. I'm still deciding a few factors here and there but I figured I'd share a bit more information.

* My previous two credits are as an Editor for a company and a 1st AD on a budgeted short film. While these are my only two professional credits, I have been a part of roughly 10 other projects in the past. 
* There is no pay involved, nor contract to sign. 
* It's not a lengthy job, the Director/Writer plans on shooting for two nights. It's all in one main location that has quite a large area to work with. He's ""experimenting"", if you will, at the logistics behind making a film with no budget and limited time.
* This is the Director/Writer's first ever time in making a film. So when I saw the publication in the newspaper that he's managed to get quite a big area closed off for filming, I approached him offering my assistance as part of the crew. He himself isn't sure exactly what he needs help with, hence why I could be the 1st AD, or just the PA with a few more responsibilities/duties.

Due to 1st AD being a somewhat high position I was unsure on whether or not being that on a horrible film could damage any future chances. "	t5_2r1ip	True

1351145691.0	121xvb	What do you guys think about having weekly/monthly contests?	mix_tape	78	13	22	"Basing off the recent blowing-up of /r/photoshopbattles I've gotten the idea to propose to the Mods here that we have some sort of competition amongst the filmmakers here on a consistent basis in the same vein. 

Why not have a contest next month to see who can make the best short film with only using inanimate objects in under a minute? Or how about a competition for the best chase scene in 30 seconds or less?

Projects can get upvoted just like they do in /r/photoshopbattles and hopefully these competitions amongst us will drive us to do great things. Also this could make getting feedback more consistent. 

As an example, I'm in a class at NYU where we all made videos are half real and half staged. Check it out (https://files.nyu.edu/lt2/public/DocOrNot2012/DocOrNot-12Mov-02.html), it was a fun little assignment and the competition amongst us really drove me, and others, to try and make the best video possible. Afterward, we all gave feedback and it turned out really well and I learned a ton from the whole process.

To be honest, there really isn't much to keep members around. Nearly every new post I see has at least a few downvotes without any explanation why. New users and young filmmakers who want to come here and show off their work are met with downvotes. There isn't much discussion. 

I get that this could be due to the pieces shown being amateurish or not wanting to hurt the feelings of the people posting. Right now, this subreddit feels like a freshman film class where everyone simply nods after the film is played. There isn't any discussion or critiquing going on. This place just seems like a way for people to post their work without contributing very much. Now I know that there have been problems with people being overly critical. There needs to be a balance. I feel that a sense of community here would help foster discussion and let the community grow in a more productive way. 

So, being a believer in the “be the change you want to see in the world” mantra, I decided to take the knowledge that I've gained and start really doing some productive writing with it. The various posts I've made before have been met with some nice responses, and even some submissions to /r/bestof. I feel like there are a lot of young users here that are thirsty for info.

So, here is my first piece. Rather than posting on a blog and posting it as a link for karma, I've decided to utilize the self-post. I hope that this will help keep people in the sub. Also, this will be a series of posts. I'll tackle whatever I feel needs to be explored. Feel free to suggest stuff as well. I hope everyone enjoys and (most importantly) is able to learn from this. The best thing that this subreddit offers is the opportunity for many different types of filmmakers to come together and share their knowledge in order to help everyone grow. 

As with most of these posts, they will be fairly lengthy. I'll also be using my personal experiences. I love film and I want to see new filmmakers get the opportunities to learn that I never had. 

*Now on to the subject.*

**Budgets**

I think that one of the biggest questions that is often raised is “how to fund my film?” I see countless crowd-sourcing campaigns (A subject that I will tackle in detail in a future post) that really don't understand how to fund an indie film. Filmmakers often expect a lot from these campaigns. In some cases, like a sci-fi film, it is totally justified. They can be expensive and successful sci-fi films often require a ton of set design and art direction. Others have budgets that are way too high. 

The thing I will push in this post most is the need to have a balanced budget. You need to have something that will allow you to achieve your artistic vision while still being able to fund the film. 

In order to successfully fund your film, you need to know how to properly write your budget. A well laid out budget can help immensely in funding. Any crowd-sourcing campaign should properly lay out how you are planning on spending the money in detail. Grants (another subject that I will be covering soon) also often require a highly detailed budget. 

Having a good budget can also help production go a bit smoother. Actually laying out a budget can help you see exactly what expenses are unnecessary. The first thing to cut out of a budget should be extra rental costs. This can be eliminated by scheduling better. The less shooting dates, the less money you'll need. The less money you'll need, the easier it will be to fund your film. Budgeting properly can also help you be prepared for shooting. You'll know exactly what is being done and for what cost. That knowledge is power and can only help you. 

Being ill-prepared can endanger a production. For example, I got the opportunity to do a short documentary on a pro-gaming tournament that was put on by IGN Entertainment. I quickly crewed up and got equipment from my university. IGN offered to cover the cost of the press-passes for the event and let us know that we only had to pay for the hotel. 

I thought “Easy enough.” I was really excited to get to cover a subject like this on such a great scale for my first real documentary film. Pre-production was rushed and I had to come up with a plan quick. I had just received my refund from my private bank loan that was used to cover tuition. It was around 600 bucks and I thought that it would be more than enough to get the production finished. 

The event was taking place in Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City and would be running extremely late. I figured that it would be best to get a hotel room in Caesar's Palace so that we could be right in the center of everything. We could go to bed late and get up early without having to worry about transportation. So I booked a room. 1 night at Caesar's palace for a room with 2 beds was nearly $400. I figured that a crew of 5 would be able to fit into the room and I booked it. 

I immediately had to spend $30 on HDV tapes for the shoot. As for transportation to the event, I managed to convince my girlfriend (who was also working as my P.A) to drive us. We all were coming from Philly so it wasn't that bad. I gave her around 40 for gas and we embarked to Atlantic City. (Prior to this, I had spent around 20 on snacks and water for the road) Little did we realize the cost of tolls along the road going from Philly to Atlantic city. I can't remember the exact prices, but it had to be around 10 bucks to get there. None of us really carried cash so we had to scramble to find money for the various tolls. 

When we got there, we shot for a 12 hour period. Our snacks were quickly eaten and we eventually had to get a meal. In Atlantic city, everything around Caesar's Palace is expensive. Even the small pizza places around the boardwalk weren't cheap. (If I had planned better, I would have realized that a McDonald's was right around the corner.) So the remaining $100 went to feeding the crew. We were barley able to scrape together the cash for the tolls to come back to Philly. 

The stress of money put a lot of pressure on me. I went in blind, expecting everything to be relatively cheap and for 180 to be a fair amount to get the production done. I figured that since I was so good about getting the crew and equipment together for free, that I wouldn't have to worry much about food and all of the other minor costs. The stress detracted from the film and it showed. I was an inexperienced filmmaker who didn't plan very much. 

If I had taken the time to sit down and write out a good budget, then I would have been better prepared for not just the expenses, but also the event itself. Production is about being prepared. 

So how do you write a good budget? For reference, [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B0-_eHZEuUzUNEE5Nk5Ga21wMWM) is a budget for a short documentary I am producing. A day's worth of production is usually 10 hours.

First, find out what your production schedule is. For narrative, you can usually shoot around 5-10 scenes a day. For documentary, it usually is reliant on how much coverage you want and also the schedule of your subjects. Next, take some time and jot down every expense you can think of. Come up with the big ones first, and move on to some of the more unexpected costs. Don't worry about the numbers yet. Simply write down everything you may need. Even if you already have the specific equipment, write these things down. Anything you may need for production should be listed. Here are my usual things: Crew and cast payment, equipment and props, food, transportation, lodging.

I then go through and find the prices for everything I listed. Crew is usually a bit difficult, as many indie films will be made up of volunteers. However, it is good to know exactly how much time people are putting into a project. Numbers can be hard to define. My rate as a producer is usually 20/hour. Directors are usually similar and crew can be anywhere from 15-18.  These are really rough estimates that help me know exactly what people are doing. 

Equipment is easier to find numbers for, as you simply look up what it costs to rent. Food, transportation and lodging is dependent on location. I usually give a good amount of money for that. You can do research, however, I find it easier to just come up with a quick number. 

Now that you have all of these numbers, it is time to add them up for one day of shooting. That number you can multiply by your shooting dates. You should be able to have a good estimate on what your film would cost. 

It's most likely a pretty high number. For example, my latest documentary is listed as 6 shooting days for a total cost of $13,481. When you get to a number like this, it's pretty staggering. However, you have a good estimate of the cost. 

Now, I go through and I mark everything I can get for free. You should be working to get anything you can for free. Actors, crew, equipment, props, locations, etc. Anything you can. Work really hard at this. The reason for marking everything is simple. It looks really good to say that I managed to get 10k worth of this stuff for free. Grants typically want you to have around 70% of your budget to be from in-kind donations. This shows that you have taken the effort to get as much as you can. It shows effort and passion. 

This also has a pretty strong psychological effect. You see how hard you've already worked. It's empowering to see the effort put in to your film. 

As for tools, I usually just use Excel. There is software out there. It costs a good amount. I am prepping to get some software so I can be a bit more organized.

But after all this work, you'll have a nice number. You'll know approximately how much you'll need and exactly what you need it for. When you go into the funding phase of your project, having an organized budget will do wonders for you. People respond to professionalism. Being organized gives the air of organization. 

Now, in my next posts (coming out in the next few weeks) I will tackle the subject of funding. This is where the budget will become pivotal. I'll cover funding in two specific outlets: Grants and Kickstarter. I have successfully achieved both. 

Please, if you have any comments, questions or criticisms, don't be afraid to post them. I'd love to help out and hear from everyone. As I said, I really want to help out the community and see filmmakers grow as artists. However, this is the first post. I would really like to hear opinions on how easy this was to read and if it was helpful.

I've been working as a composer in LA for the past three years.  I'm not at the top of the game by any means but I have been working on a lot of projects with both well seasoned directors &amp; fresh out of school directors.  It seems to me that even the best schools in the country (USC, AFI, NYU) only teach you the very basics of music and how synch music works.  Here are a few guidelines and opinions you might find helpful.  If you'd like more info on any of this drop me a note.  I'm always happy to talk music with filmmakers.

**Step 1 - deciding on your music.**

There are a lot of options.  licensed music from bands, library (aka production) music, or a composer.  You're probably going to *want* to use licensed music.  I know this because of all the projects I get temped with Radiohead, The Black Eyed Peas, Aviici, and the like but in reality you can't afford this.  Seriously, unless Trent Reznor is your cousin you should really not even put the social network soundtrack against your picture even as a joke.  because you'll love it and then you'll be all ""let's just leave it in for now.""  terrible idea.  It will only end in tears.  If you're going to license music go find it on soundcloud and *contact the artist before you temp their music to picture.*  This way you don't end up working with a prima donna who wants thousands because they're awesome like that.  Have a contract at the ready, and get them to sign it as soon as they agree to let you have their music for no money.  

Library music is generally OK and you can sift through piles of crap to find something that works.  Then you pay a modest fee (anywhere from $20 - tens of thousands depending on your project and the library you're negotiating with) and you get the rights to use that music in your film.  

A composer will write music to picture and is the best thing for any film, but they come in all kinds and you have to wait to hear what they come up with.  You have to tell them what you do and do not like and then hope that their feelings aren't going to be too hurt.  Good composers don't give a shit.  New/young composers can get really attached to their work and be a little put out if you don't like it too.

You need to decide early on how you want to handle music and prepare accordingly.  If you're going to use bands get contracts ready.  If you're going to use library do your research and budget appropriately.  If you're going to use a composer find them as early in the process as you can.  There is NOTHING more frustrating than finding out that a director has ""no money left"" for the music but spent a couple grand on sandwiches for the crew on set.  If you hire them earlier you'll budget for their fee.  Please budget for their fee. 

**Step 2 - Temping your film.**

If you temp your film before sending it to your composer you should temp it with the most god awful crap you can find that still carries the emotional quality that you're looking for.  Trust me on this.  If you temp with the Social Network soundtrack or the Inception soundtrack and then hand it to your young composer YOU WILL HATE WHAT THEY GIVE YOU.  Why?  because you temped your picture with Oscar winning music that was recorded and mixed and mastered professionally and if your composer could write like that already then they sure as shit wouldn't be working on your ""indie short.""  You want to give them something that they're going to be better than.  Something that you're going to be glad to get rid of.  Tell your composer what about that crappy temp you think works (the rhythm, the strings, the build, the synth idea, the ""darkness"")

Before you send your composer ask them what they want in the video.  SMPTE timecode?  two pop?  I prefer dialog &amp; SFX to be panned hard left and temp music to be panned hard right so that I can split them out.  Make sure that you put a card before the 2 pop that says ""[film title],[composer's name],[frame rate],[audio sample rate]""  (ex. ""Short Film, Jim Dandy composer cut, 24 FPS, 48k audio"")  Trust me, this is SUPER important information and if anything doesn't get delivered to you in proper format you can point to that card and say ""dude, you got this all in the video I sent you.""

**step 3 - Notes.**

So you just got version 1 of the music back and WOW did mr. composer man (or woman) miss the boat.  First, wait as long as you can to write your notes to them.  Live with it for at least 24 hours.  You might find that something works really well while other things might not.  Maybe it's just TOO LOUD (composers always mix the music too loud against dialog.  expect it.) 

But after living with it and mulling it over you're sure that there's a lot that's not working.  If you can, write everything down.  Make sure that you give two positive responses for every negative.  This can be hard if your composer missed the mark completely but try.  ""I really like the strings but I hate that synth sound.""  that can work.

Never, ever, ever say ""what the temp does really well is..."" because your composer will hear ""why can't you be the temp!?""  Instead, say something like ""your cue needs a little more..."" because then they feel like you're actually listening to the music and talking about what they did, not someone else's work.  Think how it would feel if someone said to you ""you know, what Spielberg does really well is...""  You'd be like, ""Why are you comparing me to him!?  That's insane!""

Talk in emotional terms.  Use emotion words.  Don't try and talk music.  Odds are you're going to use a term wrong and confuse your composer.  Unless you have some kind of degree in music avoid musical terms.  Speak to your composer like you would to your actors.  Emotions, elements of story, dramatic intent... stuff like that.  Your composer is telling a story though a different medium.  Give them the tools to tell that story.  Tell them what emotional content the music needs to have and give SPECIFIC TIMECODE if you want certain hits or moment accentuated.

**Step 4 - Revisions**

Try to limit yourself to two revisions, no more than three.  Unless you're paying them a shit load of money.  Then check the contract to make sure there aren't revision limits (mine says two revisions per cue or you pay more money but I'm not a total jackass about it,) and if not then go for it.  But in general most of you are going to be working with someone who's working for free or almost free so try and get what you need from them in two revisions.  If they're not giving you what you want by the 2nd revision you might have to examine your communication skills or expectations.  This is, of course, assuming that you're not asking for rock and getting jazz.  If they're sucking a giant nut then get a new composer.  If they're revising and revising and giving you what you ask for and you're still not happy try and find out where the communication is breaking down.

**step 5 - delivery**

Spell out to them what you want as a deliverable.  Do you want one long stereo audio file (for anything 15 minutes or less do this.  It's easier on you.)  Do you want stems? (unless you've got a really professional dub engineer don't ask for stems)  Tell them specifically file format, bit depth, sample rate.  (example: gimme .wav files, 24 bit 48k.)  If they are using ProTools then audio will spot directly to timecode in your avid session.  BUT just to be sure you should ask them to title each audio file with the SMPTE code that it starts on.  (example ""1m02_title_01111513.wav"")  This way your mixing engineer can spot the audio to the correct TC or check it if it spots automatically.  

**Step 6 - Credit**

Always ask as early as possible how your composer wants to be credited.  Make sure to ask if they have any ""additional music by..."" credits or musicians to credit.  Since the vast majority of you are small indie types you should tell your composer to create and submit their own cue sheets.  But if you're amazingly awesome you will get a cue sheet from them and submit it to ASCAP and BMI for them.  This is so that if your film gets any play on TV or in theaters or whatever then your composer will get some performance royalties.  If they're not registered with ASCAP or BMI ask them why they don't like money.  Then tell them to get their shit together and register.  

**Step 7 - Ask me questions**

Feel free to shoot me a message with specific questions on dealing with composers or music for film in general if you want more specifics.  

I'm sure I've skipped over a lot.  I didn't even cover publishing.  If other composers want to fill in or correct any of the above please do.  Being that this is Reddit and I've put up a bunch of opinions I'm sure that there will be plenty of posts contradicting a lot of what I've put up here or calling me a jerk or something.  Just keep in mind that this is all advice coming from my time working with people who are at the same level as many of you.  "	t5_2r1ip	True

I have been doing this video thing since I was 13. I've seen the industry change dramatically in the short 31 years I've been around, and I'm not gonna claim I am the best video guy on the planet, but this shit is getting out of fucking hand at this point.

They want you to not get paid and provide your own gear. WHAT THE FUCK! Why do I need to spend hundreds if not THOUSANDS of dollars on gear only to work for you for no money? How does that even make any fucking sense?

I keep seeing this over and over again on craigslist and various other internships that pop up when I'm searching for paid video jobs. I'm seriously wondering how these people can even fathom this will work out, either the people who post it or anyone dumb enough to actually apply. Its disgusting and there is nothing I can do about it.

I have seen it all and by ""all"" I mean the same 30 type of student films over and over again. Look, I too was a film student, and I was very very guilty of this, but I want to pass this advice on cause I really think this is a tough hurdle to conquer as a beginning filmmaker: don't assume that the only way the filmmaking community will take you seriously is if you make a ""serious"" film. Short films about abortions, human trafficking, drug overdoses, paranoid schizophrenics, prostitutes that get beat up and raped, love ones that die in car accidents...etc. You know, ""serious"" films.

Being taken “seriously” by the film community doesn’t mean you have to hit the audience in the face with a sledgehammer saying, ""I did a film about this intense issue! Look at how mature I am!” It's about telling a visual story (no matter how short) about INTERESTING characters. I have seen too many student short films that deal with these hard hitting serious issues but with incredibly boring cardboard cut out characters, basically cause they have under 15mins to make a “point.” They fall flat and they become dreaded “film student clichés.”

Sorry, I’ve been projecting student films all day. I’m kinda loopy from 9 hours of “serious” films. This issue dawned on me as I was projecting a student’s movie which was a comedy. I just can’t tell you what a relief it is to show a filmmaker’s thesis that had a sense of humor after 20 “serious” films. It’s really night and day to the audience (and to the agents and producers that have to screen all these as well). The more “serious” the film the more scrutiny it invites: acting, lighting, production design, music, etc. If you don’t have the resources to back up your “serious” story it can fall apart easily. With comedy all those issues can go out the window. You just require good writing, comedic timing, and smart directing. Also, the most incredible phenomenon happens when you show a comedy: the audience will let you know what they really think by laughing. A drama, it’s silent. Everyone could be lying to you when they say, “your film was good.” You don’t know what their real reaction is.	

I guess what I am trying to say is that if you are in film school still you should have fun with your  thesis film. You are presenting yourself to the world. Don’t take yourself so seriously so early by trying to tackle the world. You will have your whole filmmaking life to build up on that. Make a simple story that you would want to watch over and over again, that you would want others to watch over again and again. Entertain.

Write from the heart and most importantly (and a big fucking cliché) write what you know. But honestly, if you are a middle-class white boy under the age of 21 who has lived in the suburbs your whole life are you really certain the story about human trafficking and miscarriages is the story you were born to tell for your breakout thesis film?

Short films are a calling card. If you want to work in Hollywood then it literally is your business card. Hollywood is a business –the entertainment business. You are making these films to entertain and capture the audience's interest. 

Do that and anyone will take you seriously, even a jaded projectionist.

I'll critique more videos if those seeking critique put a little more thought into what they're seeking critique on.

Here's what I'd love to see:

* How long your video is. It may weed out and kill a lot of reviews of your content, but if I know how long it is, I can find a time to actually give it attention.

* I want to know specifics for what you're seeking critique on. Is it the narrative? Do you not know how your talent performs? Is it technical. You don't have to write an essay, but throw me a bone and send me in  a specific direction. I'm not going to spend time with the open ended videos.

* Don't just beg for critique in the title and link to youtube. Make a text post, talk about it, show me that this matters by actually trying to get me to care. Not only is it good practice for you, but it placates my ego as well (yeah, it's a truth) and makes me feel like you really want me to sit and write something.

* If you have bad audio, intro titles that are too long, or poor compression rates for your content I'm going to move along. Those are some of my base filtering criteria. It may not be for everyone, but I'm putting that out there, I'm only really going to look at things that meet a certain criteria that's already in my mind.

* If you're argumentative or overly defensive in the comments, or absent from the comments I'll move along.

* Conversely if you're engaging in good conversation, open to the fact you're asking for people to bash you from all over the planet and you take it all with a humble grain of salt, I'll probably expound further upon my initial comments.

* Don't spam me with 10 of your videos. Be thoughtful of the entire subreddit and try to choose your content with care.


Now, I'm not trying to lay down any laws or really change the subreddit into only what I expect, but since we're all talking a lot about expectations and what we'd like to see more of... I just want to share my own perspective.

I doubt everyone will agree with me, and I don't really mind. It's not the point to find consensus on this to me, the point is to be open about how I personally sort through and decide what I want to talk about and what I don't.

But hey whatever. This is all a voluntary community all around.

1362239869.0	19ixpp	Hi r/filmmakers! I just finished scoring a short film - here are some tips for you when you're working with or trying to find a composer for your project.	musicformedia	63	11	12	"Looking for a composer:

* **Ask to see demos of their previous work** - both visual and audio. A composer could have great Soundcloud demos, but might not be able to score a movie. Writing a film score is an art form in itself and takes years of experience - not just anyone who can write music is able to write a film score.
* **You don't always need an incredibly flexible composer** - just a composer that is great in the genre you need. If you want a simple piano score (a la Philip Glass for example), look for composers with great piano music who have worked on films before. Often composers who try to work in every genre, can be weaker than a composer who focuses on a couple of specific genres. For example, I'm great at action/drama/comedy/sci-fi genres, but would fail at an epic level if I tried to score a Bollywood movie.
* **Try to find someone who is recommended to you**. There is no better reference than word of mouth - someone who has worked with a composer already will know the quality of their work so if you know someone who has worked with a composer, it might be a great place to start.
* **Google search and check the IMDB credits of any potential composers**. Sometimes you might find other filmmakers have written a review of the composer you are looking at hiring and this can be useful (for example, their music might be great, but they might not work well with others). Also, IMDB credits can sometimes validify a composers' level of experience.
* **Start your search early!**. Typically you should start looking for a composer once you start post-production, but I've had film makers contact me when they simply have the script and nothing more. As a composer, its great to get on board from the outset as you can start to work on ideas/themes and make sure the whole process goes as smoothly as possible from the start.
* **Beware the free!**. Often times when you post your project on a forum, you'll get hundreds of composers offering to score your project for free. My advice - DO NOT HIRE THEM. They will be amateur composers who are writing music in their spare time (ie. they have another full time job), or they might be music college graduates who have little or no experience. Forgetting both of those facts, by not paying a composer anything, it gives them little encouragement to write the best music they can write and often they might not even finish the music if something else comes up - leaving you up poop creek without a paddle!
* **Set aside your budget from the outset - and don't skimp on it**. A composer has to write, orchestrate, arrange, record, edit, produce, mix and master the music - bare this in mind when setting aside your budget. Whereas some parts of your production will have one person doing that one single job, a composer has to fulfill every single job that is required for creating the music. It can be a hugely time consuming and stressful job (but I love it!). Also, don't forget when you are putting together your budget that if you want live players rather than midi/sampled music, your budget will need to go up dramatically! Live players are not cheap.
* **Know what you're looking for**. Do you want exclusive music for your project (written exclusively for you and cannot be used anywhere else again), non-exclusive music (can be written for you, but used/licensed elsewhere again - making it cheaper). Learn what options are out there and which one suits you and your projec the best.

Working with a composer:

* **Learn a couple of musical terms so you can get your ideas across more easily**. For example ""crescendo"" (a gradual increase in volume), ""tempo"" (the speed of the music), ""phrase"" (a group of musical notes after which there is a very short break - like a breath).
* **Speak in emotions**. As the music needs to enhance the on screen emotions, when you are doing your spotting session with your composer, tell them what emotions you want to be conveyed in that scene. Be very specific in what emotions you choose and what emotions you don't want.
* **A temp track can help**. A [Temp track](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temp_track) can be a good guideline for the type of music you want for a scene. Often directors use classical music for certain types of scenes or other film music they like to show a composer the style or instrumentation they are going for. As a composer, I often find this useful to get a general idea of what the director is looking for.
* **Understand the process a composer will be going through**. [The Film Scoring Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score#Process_of_creation) is basically as follows: spotting (finding where in your film needs music), writing (often just rough tracks or even just simple piano sketches), orchestration (giving the melody/countermelody/harmony to different instruments in the orchestra), then recording (either using live players or using software). If you want to drastically change the music in a scene, know that the composer will need to go through this process again from scratch - which is fine, but can't be done right away.
* **Treat early ""draft"" cues as what they are - just drafts**. When I work with a director, I love to send across my first initial musical ideas as soon as possible in order to start getting feedback. This means they won't sound amazing but don't have to as they are just a rough guide. Know to expect this - you will know just how good a composer's music will be when finished as you should have already seen/heard their demo reel. 
* **Listen without the music, then with the music - does it enhance the scene?** The purpose of music in any form of visual media is to **enhance**. In films especially, it enhances the emotions of a particular scene - however, sometimes the music can actually force the emotions of a scene to an extent where the music becomes very obvious. In order to make sure this doesn't happen, watch the scene without the music, and then again with the music and ask yourself - does the music enhance what's happening on screen or take away from it? 
* **Try to respond with feedback as quickly as possible**. If a composer sends you over a cue or asks a question, try to get back to them straight away so they're not waiting to hear back from you before being able to keep going. 

Hopefully that list helps you a little bit. A great film score can make a movie - just as a bad one can break it - so never underestimate how valuable a good composer is to your project :)

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the above list, or if you have any suggestions for me as a composer on how to work with you on projects? Thanks!

Seems like the major consensus has thus far been: don't skimp on good audio, don't over color-grade, avoid extremely shallow DOF... what else?

My opinion:

1. Static shots.  Not every shot has to be on a dolly or steadicam, or handheld.  Don't be afraid of static shots!  Let the action in the scene tell the story, pan and/or tilt when necessary.

2.  Focusing.  Don't go crazy racking focusing between the main subject and everything else in frame.  What the lens is focused on is meant to signal to the audience what to pay attention to, don't divert their attention just to show off your focus pulling skills.

3.  Get your colors, framing, etc right as much as possible in-camera.  Avoid the ""we'll fix it in post"" mentality.

4.  Avoid filters &amp; effects in post to give your movie the ""film look"" - 99.9% of the time it's going to look obvious and tacky.

5.  Avoid gun shots and explosion VFX unless you're really good at it.

6.  Don't crop your footage to a more ""cinematic"" aspect ratio unless you shot for it.  "	t5_2r1ip	True

It was 30 days of grueling ass-grinding interspersed with great fun times. I know these 10 Things is lame, but people love lists and I'll try to make them as fun and enjoyable as a DMV line.

1. Murhpy's Finger

Murphy's Law is that if anything can go wrong, it will. There was no other place were this law was proven time and again than on this horror shoot. Even though we tried to reduce Murphy's Law breeding grounds as much as possible, Murphy was still able to slip a slimy finger up into our buttholes - you name it, we got it: flat tires, lost audio files, an actor almost dying (he's fine), firing actors, equipment getting lost, equipment getting fried, faulty equipment shocking us, crazy people harassing us, and a bunch of other bad shit. It could have been a lot worse for us, but just remember that even though you may try to plan for everything ahead of time, Murphy's finger will be always prevalent.

2. It Will Be Over Soon

On the first day, were shooting without permission at a train station in the early morning. Hundreds of things could have gone wrong and my mind was going through each of them - I was freaking myself out. Of course, only the worse things occur in your head but in reality the only problem we had was a crazy person calling out ""Privacy! Privacy"" in english because he thought that we were recording him (he was a vagrant sleeping in the background of the shot). He threatened to call the cops but no one ever came.  Just remember to remain calm at all times. First is to accept the situation, and then second thing is to take each problem one at a time. If worse comes to worse and you're still freaking out, just tell yourself ""It will be over soon.""

3. Batman Belt

I never thought that these items would come in super handy a few times every day but I'll never go into a film shoot without them: Flashlight, work gloves, and a multitool. We were shooting in a deep and dark place, so the flashlight was always handy. Many times we were dealing with things that could give us splinters, and the weather was crazy cold when we were there so the gloves saved my fingers more than once. The multitool saved my ass many times: locks that got stuck were fixed, screws the needed tightening, and things that needed to be cut.

4. Puppies

On the shoot, animosity grew between an actor and a crew member. The problem was that the actor had done nothing wrong to the crew member whatsoever - the crew member just didn't like the actor because of the way he or she was behaving. I totally understood because I was getting annoyed by that person to, but then I realized that it was like being annoyed at a puppy. If a puppy poops or pees everywhere, do you get mad at it? It's just the way puppies are, no need to get angry or annoyed by them. As long as they're not bothering you, or interfering with your work, you just have to deal with it or ignore it.

Point is that you have to accept people as they are and the way they behave - you're not going to change them.

5. Worst Superpower

The worse superpower you have is the power of assumption. DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING. Consider yourself ignorant of all things and make sure with 100% certainty that you are sure of something. I ASSUMED that the clothing sponsor we had would email us when they needed our information, but when we needed the clothing for a certain day, it was not ready because we never emailed them when they needed the clothes ready. One day I ASSUMED that someone else had the audio equipment, but we left the house without anyone taking it. On one of the final days, I told an actress that she was going to be in the water, but she ASSUMED that she was just going to be walking through the water, and I ASSUMED that she understood that her ass was going to be laying down in the cold ass water. We both ASSUMED that the other knew what we were talking about. All of these examples are communication problems, but it stems from ASSUMPTIONS.

6. WATER TIGHT PROCEDURES

Make sure you have a water tight system for collecting, dumping, clearing, and cleansing memory cards. Once you're settled on the process, DO NOT CHANGE IT. I lost audio for a whole scene because I decided to change my procedure of copying audio folders. I decided to change from coping all of the audio folders to just copying one folder, and apparently, something happened where the audio files for the scene were in another folder that I did not copy. We also lost 4 shots because I they were shot on a card that I thought was already dumped, the AC forgot to mark it with a green sticker, meaning that it had new footage instead of just old footage.

7. Your Dialogue Sucks

There are two reasons why your dialogue may suck: First reason, you write shitty dialogue. Read it out loud. Does it sound ridiculous? Then rewrite it. Now get a friend or relative to read it out loud again. Does it still sound ridiculous? Congratulations, you write shitty dialogue. However, if your dialogue sounds believable, then the second reason that it may still suck is that the actors get the subtext wrong. What do I mean? No, it's not because the actors suck, its that they get the subtext wrong and you have to explain it to them.

Context and subtext go hand in hand. In a scene where two people that have hated each other at first and fell in love later, when they finally come together to kiss, the girl says ""I hate you,"" the subtext is ""I love you.""  If the actor says it wrong, it's because she didn't get the subtext. It's your job to fix it.

8. Look at the monitor

There were many times where I couldn't stand behind the DP to look at the monitor while we were shooting. We couldn't afford to have an extra monitor without sacrificing the budget in another areas, so we opted out of getting one. I really regret not getting an extra portable monitor. There are just some things that you can't really pick up on unless you're looking at the scene being played in a monitor. There's a lot of nuance and subtleties that you miss so that when you're in the editing room, you're kicking yourself for not seeing it even though you were there when it was being filmed. That's because your eyeballs are not a filmscreen. Your eyeballs pick up everything in that room or whoever you're shooting, where as the monitor is focused on just your actor(s).

My point is do whatever you have to do to get an extra monitor that you can look through at all times.

9. Open Flow of Ideas

The whole point of making a feature film is to make the best film possible with the time, money, and resources you have. However, rank and hierarchy may get in the way of the flow of good ideas. Some people may be weary or afraid of giving their input because they're worried that they may be ""stepping out of their bounds."" I don't believe in such a thing - if you have a good idea, you have a good idea and it should be heard. Speak to every cast and crew member individually and tell them that if they have any ideas, to come to you privately to discuss them. There were many times where the actors or a crew member came up to me AFTER a scene was done and they had a good idea but now the opportunity was wasted, so breed a set that has an open flow of Ideas.

Why should extra ideas be talked privately instead of openly? Because you may have to reject it - not every idea is a good idea. Some people get butthurt that their idea was not thought of as being good so they will try to defend it publicly, which just makes it worse, so when possible discuss ideas privately.

10. Dark side

If you're making a film shoot that's either 30 days or even 3 days, make sure it's with people that you've known for a long time DEEPLY, or that you are at least familiar with their dark side. Everyone has a dark side. EVERYONE. Low budget shoots are tough, and it's bad enough that you're under-manned, under-financed, and then you have to deal with an asshole or a diva.  If you know you're going to work with someone that has a dark side for 10 days and longer, then at least you have the advantage of knowing their full character before hand.

Point is make sure to know someone well enough before you agree to work with them for a long ass time.

Leave 20% of the budget for mistakes, if it's your first time making a feature film.

Always say ""thank you"", ""please,"" and ""appreciate it."" Those few words go a long way.

Listen to your goddamn intuition.

1328646591.0	pf4zd	Some Quick Advice On Crowdfunding For Filmmakers	zakforsman	56	8	17	"After successfully crowdfunding a feature-length crime thriller entitled [""Down and Dangerous"" on Kickstarter](http://kck.st/qB45dd), I’ve been asked a number of times for advice on how to crowdfund a movie, so I thought I’d post it here…

* Do an “all or nothing” campaign. There is still a stigma to the idea that “filmmakers can keep the money even if they don't hit their goal”. I know too many people who refuse to donate to campaigns like that because, frankly, no one wants to have their money go to waste if you cant raise what you said you needed to make the movie.

* Your pitch video should demonstrate a strong command of your filmmaking ability. Inspire confidence. Show them you can make a movie that looks like a movie. That means putting the same effort into it that you would into the making of the movie. You are a filmmaker, there is NO excuse for bad sound, wonky edits, bad lighting, noisy footage, etc. If you and your team are sitting down to record your pitch video and you or someone on your team says “the mic on the camera will be good enough”… you are not ready.

* Don’t waste your time spamming people you don’t know. Focus on your core audience, the people who care. That is family, friends, co-workers, colleagues, etc. When someone donates, thank them publicly on their facebook profile and INCLUDE THE LINK TO YOUR CAMPAIGN. They will likely respond with a comment saying why they donated: “I believe in you” or “it’s looks awesome!”. Now you have a public testimonial that all THEIR friends can see. This is how we were able to run our campaign without randomly spamming facebook and twitter.

* If you fail to find support, consider it a test or “filter” for what you’re putting out there and take a good hard look at it as you reassess. Why did you fail to connect? People generally don’t donate for the perks.
This is the thing I stressed over for weeks before we launched: What am I offering people who back us? Perks? Blah. Who really wants a poster of a movie that doesn’t even exist yet? No one. Think about what has inspired you to donate to someone’s campaign (and if you haven’t, you have bigger issues). What was it that motivated you to part with some dough? was it because of the movie they were making? Or was it something about them and their personal story and perhaps seeing yourself in their goals and ambitions? For me, the campaigns I donate to always seem to touch something inside of me that connects with my own aspirations and ideas about moviemaking. But it’s not that the film is personal, it’s because the filmmaker shared something personal that I could relate to. I think, “I like what this person is doing, where their head is at, I want to help.” Then I click the donate button. I’ve never said “okay, their pitch video was too long, it was edited weird, their poster looks bad, but damn it I love horror comedies! I’m donating!!!”

* Be prepared to be at it every day. During our campaign, I spent nearly every waking hour either at the computer fostering the campaign, or shooting and editing video content to release as updates. Probably averaged no less than 14 hours a day on it for 30 days.

* Build your team out of people who run in different social circles. You will need help, but if you and your team only know the same people, you’re only multiplying the annoyance factor for your friends and followers by the number of people in your team.

* Do a short campaign. Kickstarter’s statistics show little benefit to running a campaign longer than 30 days. 30 days is the sweet spot. Use it to your advantage to create a sense of urgency. And use milestones and minigoals. It’s easier to motivate people to help you reach 25% funded by this Friday, than to reach 100% funded by the end of the month. Plus, you can publicly salute the people who brought you to each milestone! “So and so gave us our first $100 donation!” or “So and so’s pledge brought us to the 10% funded mark!”

* At every step, don’t think like a filmmaker trying to raise money, think like a backer coming across your campaign for the first time. If you got an unsolicited email or postcard from someone you didn’t know, would you give them $25? $100? doubtful. When people send you facebook invites to ‘like’ something, do you ignore them? I do. So why would I expect others to react differently to my requests? Look to your own behavior. What moves you to take action? How many times must you hear about something before you check it out? Who in your social media circles is recommending the random youtube videos you watch each day and why do you trust their “recommendation”? Is it because you share interests? Or because you admire them? I am not a salesman. It’s not in my nature. But I’ve found a lot of answers by looking at my own habits and behavior online.

* Last one. Talking AT people is not as effective as talk WITH them. I was able to keep a dialogue going about the project on twitter and facebook by releasing more videos about the project, posting audio recordings that inspired different aspects of the story and engaging in a public conversation with anybody who showed interest. But to have something to talk about, you need to be producing new content throughout the campaign. I liken the running of a campaign to producing a web series. And as filmmakers, producing quality, engaging content is what we’re good at. So use it.

* Okay, this really is the last one. Be a part of the community. Get on twitter. Search for relevant keywords and follow the people who are part of that discussion and join it. Meet people, make friends, support THEIR projects, write blog posts, comment on theirs, give give give, be a decent human being and participate in the indie film community and you will be rewarded. Because these are the people who will support you in kind when you launch your crowdfunding campaign. This is your social media army who will be tweeting on your behalf and spreading the word. If you approach it as networking, you’re doing it wrong. The filmmakers, actors, producers, composers and others I’ve met on dvxuser and twitter, many have become lifelong friends. If you find yourself making genuine friendships, you’re doing it right."	t5_2r1ip	True

This was followed up by a ""We know you have 2 guys there working all day on this and you quoted us an extra week of work to do this when we know you just automate it and let machines do it"".

They raged for an hour and then CANCELLED the whole job. Luckily that will cost them quite a tidy penny or two considering we were on the final stage of this production.

Got a call from a friend at another studio an hour later asking if we had cancelled a job. Client is now calling post studios around the city trying to get a 1 day job out of them because we ""fucked them over"".

1363050464.0	1a4a9n	Would there be any interest in a AMA with Audio professionals?	fatjesus	49	2	22	"I'm a post audio and composition professional and really enjoy spreading the gospel of sound in a non-divisive way. There are some major gaps in the knowledge of the workflow for audio in the indie film scene (especially in post audio), and I don't believe it is out of lack of caring as much as it is lack of resources. There is a lot more to it than catching room tone and fading your regions.  A feature film will have anywhere from 120-400 tracks of audio by the time it hits the mixing stage.  If you don't know anything about the process you can't budget for it properly and it *will* hurt your film.  

All that said, I am still relatively new.  However, I know plenty of people who are very experienced and I'm sure I could rope them into answering some questions or at least monitoring my answers if there is some interest. If there are any more seasoned audio pros reading this that would like to partake and aren't afraid of showing /r/filmmakers their credentials or making a throwaway please pm me.

**Edit**: It appears there is some interest.  I have alerted a couple of more veteran sound people I know and will post the AMA tomorrow around **11am CST**.  

**Edit 2**: Alright, I've roped in a couple guys I know who do re-recording mixing (on is rrsounddesign), editing and many other things at a professional sound house to help me out in case I start spreading any accidental misinformation.  They will be in a mix most of the day but will answer anything I miss later on.  "	t5_2r1ip	True

1376440320.0	1kbehx	Paths for breaking into the industry by producing original content? Festivals vs. Web?	Derp2244	49	5	34	"I graduated from film school last year and moved to LA with a bunch of other people from my class. As of right now, all of us have paying gigs in the industry, desk job assistant type stuff, but we really want to start creating original material in our free time. We started a weekly writer's group and we're kicking ideas around for a big project to collaborate on. 

My question is, **what do you think the best course of action is for a dozen young filmmakers who want to break into the industry by creating original content?** Traditionally I feel like amateur filmmakers used to bank on getting their films into festivals for mainstream recognition, but I think creating a popular web series is just as valuable when it comes to demonstrating that you can attract audiences.

Maybe I'm missing other avenues, but at the moment, these are the two platforms I'm looking towards. Anyone have any advice on how you might make a creative name for yourself in film and tv?

Thought I'd just share the love myself if anyone wants to mess around with the footage from my shoots without it being an actual project. 

It's only music video stuff - 2k and 4k, lens flare, 50fps pretty shots."	t5_2r1ip	True

1347213470.0	zlza2	Beyond 3 point lighting	w3y	44	2	10	"There was a recent thread where the OP learned there was more than a basic 3 point lighting set up. So I figured, it might be worth while to just talk through some concepts to help give an idea beyond 3 point lighting.

There are generally 5 lighting ""areas"":

* Key
* Fill
* Back aka Hair
* Background
* Eye aka Catch Light

**Key**

The key is your primary source of light. In traditional 3 point lighting, this is usually your biggest light pointed at your subject to get exposure. Often times, it is put at the subject's 45\*, raised and tilted down 45\*.

But the key can really come from anywhere, sometimes even the back!

When you move the key, it changes where shadows fall on faces. And shadow is your main tool for conveying mood.

**Fill**

The fill is what controls your contrast ratio. A lot of times, your key will be really powerful and the shadows create a really dark side on the subjects face. You use fill to bring up this side, not only so you can see it, but control how dramatic it is. The more your fill approaches your key, the less dramatic it will be.

The fill is also used to control wrap. Depending on where it's placed, you can make a light look like it's ""wrapping"" around your subject, creating a nice gentle fall off into shadow.

**Back aka Hair**

This light lights up the subjects hair or back. It's used to help separate the subject from the background. Especially helpful when your subject has black hair on a dark background.

If the light is offset to 45* at eye level, you get something called a kicker. Where the light creates more than just a little edge. It starts creating a much hotter ""zone"" (we'll get to zones later). This is generally favorable on men because most women's hair will block the light from hitting their faces.

**Background**

The background light exposes anything in the background you woud like to see. But it's also used to create contrast in the rest of your frame.

**Eye aka Catch Light**

The eye light is the little sparkle in your subject's eye. Often times, it will naturally be there as a result of your key. But sometimes, because of the way your subject is facing, they don't always have it, so you have to set it up.

[Jacoolh adds: ""...the eye light, or catch light, can be used as a focus aid for operators.""]

**Lighting Setups**

In general, I would say there are 6 major lighting setups with respect to the key: 1) Three-quarters, 2) Side, 3) Top, 4) Front, 5) Back and 6) Under.

**Three-quarters**

This is your traditional lighting setup where your key is at 45\* to the subject, raised up and tilted down 45\*. It generally creates a small triangle of light on subjects cheek that is quite pleasing.

**Side**

The key is brought down to eye level and put directly to one side of the subject. This creates a strong distinction between one side of the subject and the other.

Often times, because of the position of your key, you won't get a good eye light, so you will probably need to give your subject one.

**Top**

The key is placed above and in front of the subject. You ses this a lot in more traditional glamour photography. It fills in a lot of the shadows in the eyes, generally gives a great eye light, and if placed correctly, can fill in a lot of wrinkles.

**Back**

Sometimes, your back light can double as your key. You see a lot of this in *Bladerunner* and *Aliens*. Here, you are primarily using fill to control your exposure and you get a lot of flexibility on what you choose to see and how dramatic the shot is.

**Under**

Similar to ""Toppy"" light, but coming from in front and below of the subject.

**Beyond**

That's just a basic run down to help you start thinking beyond three point lighting. Each of the setups can be used with any variation of fill to create different moods and looks. The important thing is to know what you're trying to do and what you like. Make choices, instead of following rules.

Hope this helped!
