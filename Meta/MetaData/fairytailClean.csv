The anime leaves off at the end of manga chapter 297, chapters 298 and 299 are funny side story chapters, and the main story picks up again on chapter 300. You can start reading from where the anime left off without missing anything. I highly recommend you read the manga.

1 This thread is based on my thoughts, opinion and theories. Feel free to leave critism, I would love to hear the theories of my fellow Fairy Tail fans. But rememer, Reddit is about discusion, don't go all flame and hate on my theories.

2 This thread WILL contain spoilers. Probably all of it. I have no intention to use the [spoiler](/manga) function, because this will be all red ;).

3 Just for the sake of it, I read the translations on Mangastream, I say this because there might be a posibility that other Manga sites use diffrent sentences. (I prefer Mangastream ;) ).

4 I am not a native English person. FYI I am Dutch and I even have dyslexia. This will contain a lot of grammar and vocabulary mistakes, please don't turn all grammar Nazi, I am doing my best and this is just to help you guys out. 

5 This will be a long post. Get into a comfortable position, maybe get some snacks ;).

Well then, lets step right into it I guess!

The reason I make this post is because there are still a lot of readers who read the chapters realy quick and don't pay attention to WHAT the characters are saying. If you read every chapter in 5 minutes, you miss so much information. Example, did you guys even notice that the mysterious girl (I think chapter 300) opend a pen with her mouth.. why, because most likely she had no second arm. This might be key in the future. 

This example was just as indication that there is a lot of hidden information in this series.

I answered a lot of questions about dragon slayers and magic and stuff. (I hope I am allowed to say that I can call myself an expert on this serie. And now, please don't think that I think I am above all of you. THAT IS TOTALLY NOT MY INTENTION.)

I answered a lot of questions about Natsu and Gajeel, even Sting and Rough etc etc.
But what is so special about dragon slayers and specificly Natsu.

Lets make a lits of things I am gonna cover:
- Age
- Magic
- Reunion
- Amnesia
- Time Travel
- Rave Master (oee, exciting :) )


AGE.

Most people know this by now. Natsu is way older then anyone had expected. Why do we basicly KNOW this? 

-Fantasia arc or Battle of Fairy Tail arc. Laxus was planning on taking over the guild. He made a big competition, as goal to eliminate all the weak members so that HIS guild would be extreemly powerful. Makarov couldn't get in his way so Freed set up a rune prison around the guild. ""Stone statues and people older then 80 can not go through."" Makarov was traped inside, but Natsu and Gajeel aswell! We know that Freed is a very honnest member and he obay and respect his own rules and even Laxus was suprised that Natsu didn't went out to search for him. We can asure that the runes are true and knowing that Natsu and Gajeel both arn't stone statues, they have to be older then 80.

-chapter 23, frontpage. Natsu his personal page. His age is unknown... wait whut? How can the age of a lead character be unknown? Suspisious... btw Gajeel his age is also unknown, but Wendy her age is confirmed as 12. I get back to her in a second.

- In later parts of this thread I will explain more about the age ""problem"".

MAGIC

Just t get a litte break of that age thingy and lets talk about his magic.
Fire dragon slayer magic. Thought bt Igneel, the mighty fre dragon.
Natsu is able to use fire magic. But as we all know, he is also able to use lightning magic (in combination with fire). Let's take the topic very serious and add some fysics into this. Fire is heat or warmth, symbol Q. Lightning is electricity. (Excuse me if I make mistakes, I don't know a lot ofEnglish Fysic terms). Electricity can you see as a Power over time: P*t will make E. E is electrical energie. Q is energy.

If you compare the two you can pretty much say that both are the same. Q = Eelec. Or Energie.

We say that Natsu is a Fire dragon slayer, but wht if I told you he was in fact a Energy dragon slayer. To prove this: The fight between Zancrow and Natsu, Natsu wasn't able to ""eat"" the fire of Zancrow, because his flames were from a diffrent type. He had to eat them in a special way. I think at that point Natsu ate the black fire not as fire, but as pure Energy.
Natsu was also able to eat pure etherion lacrima, or pure magical energy. He went even into Dragon Force. Same with the flame of Rebution (Sorry, I forgot the name...). He ate 2 times pure Energy, his origional magic is pure energy and he can manipulate ""Energy"" magic.

REUNION

This will be difficult to explain. Lets start of with Natsu and Wendy.
Chapter 101. Grandine visits Igneel. I will litery quote one of Grandine her sentences: "" That boy(Natsu) Will eventualy meet up with Wendy soon. I hope they will get along well THIS TIME."" I myself read amost over this part. I can confirm that this is the legit translation. I have this particulair volume (I have up to volume 18) and I can even confim that Hiro Mashima approved the translation.

This means that Natsu and Wendy knew eachother before Wendy joined the serie. This is a bit strange, because, if we can asume that Natsu is older than he looks like and Grandine is talking about this, like this happend many years ago, why is Wendy her age 12? 
Prove that Natsu knows Wendy: The first chapter of the Oracion Seis arc. The moment Natsu saw Wendy and heard her name, he reconized the name, but he couldn't remember. He even asked Gray to remeber it for him ;).

Tenrou Island arc. Zeref appears and Natsu saved Elfman and Evergreen. Zeref sees Natsu and starts crying... ""Natsu, you have grown so much."" ZEREF KNOWS NATSU. He has been asleep for over 400 years?! How the heck does he know Natsu? Don't tell me.... Yes, I think that it is possible for Natsu to be over 400 years old.

Sting and Rough. When they were youg, they both had two heroes... Natsu and Gajeel. This does not mean that they met but it is kind of strange. Lets say that Sting and Natsu both look 17. Natsu got into a time skip so in the origional time, X785 if I remember correct Sting was 7 years younger. In X777 July 7th, the dragons dissapeard. Natsu should be age 10 at that time. STING WAS 3. How in the name of the firts master, can a little boy of 3 kill a dragon? This doesn't seem right. Even if I am 2 years of with Sting his age.. a 5 year old killing his dragon? I can include this to my AGE theory. How I want to include this to REUNION is that I think that both knew eachother when they were still with their dragons. Igneel shouted just before their fight: ""Let's see how you raised your children, Skyramia, Vice Logia"" or something like that... It doesn't say it directly, but it can meen that Igneel knew the dragons... personaly.

AMNESIA

I don't think this will be very hard to understand. Natsu can not remember Wendy, Zeref and maybe his age he think he is is a lie.
One day to the other, Igneel dissapeard and Natsu has no idea why and where to.

TIME TRAVEL

The next part are predictions. They have not happend yet. There are a few things we have to know about time travel. Time travel is extreemly dangerous, because 1 little change can change everything (Just for fun: Go and watch Back to the Future ;) ). They want to change time to go back into the past 400 years ago to stop Zeref. What if I told you that Team Natsu brought Zeref into the past and not making a new timeline, but creating the timeline that excists right now. This idea is not mine, but it is awesome. I don't know who came up with it, but I don't want any grace for it. I am just here to share it with you. 

What if I told you that Zeref is in fact Romeo, son of Makao. 
3 things: - Looks. They look a lot like eachother. - Cry, at the moments Zeref saw Natsu, he cried because he was happy to see him. The moment Natsu returned after 7 years, Romeo cried because his big hero was back. - Romeo increase of character. Uuh yes, how to explain... lets say that Romeo at the very beginning of the series was a bit of a dull character. Not important. Right after the timeskip Mashima made Romeo look like the new Natsu of the guild. We might not notice it directly, but Romeo appears a lot in the manga lately. This increasement of ""importantness"" might not be for the sake of ""a new lead character"". I think Mashima is working on making him bigger as character so the transition from little boy into Darklord will be way more shocking.
I can asure you, if Romeo follows them trough the portal, we now know what he will become, if he does not joins them, then you can ignore this part ;).

RAVE MASTER...

Why Rave? For the people who don't know, Rave Master was Hiro Mashima his firts serie. The ""prequel"" of Fairy Tail. A lot of characters from Fairy Tail are based on characters of Rave. Lucy-Ellie, Musica-Gray, Let-Elfman, ""let gf(don't kow the name &gt;.&gt; shame on me)""- Evergreen. And of course: Haru and Natsu (fun fact: Haru=Spring, Natsu=Summer. In another short story Mashima wrote he had Aki and if I'm right that means Autum or season).
DON'T FORGET PLUE :D!

Not only characters, but also plot is similair in some points,like the time travel. The time travel was the beginning f the end of Rave. Every mystery so far was explained in the timetravel. Ellie appeard to be the princes and was locked in a body that coudn't age, for like 20 years and she got amnesia. He even brought back the skeleton in the desert which appeard to be noone other than Siegrain (the character Jellal/Mystogan is based on). 

I think, that it might be possible for FairyTail to stop pretty soon. Not longer then 2 years... 
Almost all the questions will be answerd: Zeref, Igneel, the age ""problem"", name them. I know some thingys that might help the serie to continue a little longer, like Tartaros, but it won't hold for longer than 1 or 2 arc...


OK GUYS... I am fking tierd right now. It took me about 2 hours to write this thing and it is about 3am ;). I go take a nap.

1367104095.0	1d8pqf	[Speculation] This is what will happen in the next arc.	Speak_Of_The_Devil	42	5	20	"**The following wall of text is based purely off of speculation. You have been warned.**

It has been shown that Future Rogue's shadow has the ability to corrupt and control individuals, as a shown in the Gajeel vs Rogue fight. What I think will happen is that Future Rogue and his 7 dragons will be defeated in the present and retreats back 400 years ago, where FR will corrupt and control young Zeref. That is why during his appearance 7 years ago at the Tenrou Island, he was unable to control the dark aura blasts; it wasn't his magic power, it's FR's corruption.

Natsu, Lucy, Gajeel, Sting, Rogue, and Wendy (and possibly Gray, Yukino, and Erza) will follow FR through the Eclipse Gate, finding a dystopian world where FR dominates the world with his dragons and Dragon Manipulation magic. Natsu meets up and befriends pre-corrupted Zeref. He will also meet up with Igneel and other pro-human dragons.

Natsu and friends enter the Dragon King Festival 400 years ago to overthrow FR. FR kills a lot of pro-human dragons, drank its blood, and became Acnologia, the **Black** Dragon .of Apocalypse. Current Rogue and Sting also killed a lot of anti-human dragons and drank its blood, effectively turning them into Weisslogia and Skyadrum (which ironically seals their fate as being killed by their younger self 393 years later). Natsu will fight and defeat Acnologia, a feat that will be immortalized in this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/8k8GQp6.png) (notice that the mage is using fire magic *and* has Natsu's scarf. That's Natsu there, foreshadowed.) 

Before his defeat, Acnologia/FR uses his immense power to send corrupted Zeref 393 years into the ""future"" to resummon him. Zeref [landed](http://i.imgur.com/c99Cip3.jpg) at Tenrou Island 393 years later, during the S-rank Exam. That's why he recognized Natsu.. he thought that was Present-sent-into-past Natsu who knew and befriended Zeref. He beg clueless Natsu to finish him off before Acnologia's magic takes hold of him.

In order to send the Eclipse FT travelers back into the present, Weisslogia/Sting and Skyadrum/Good-Rogue stayed behind to power the portal. Then Weisslogia, in order to warn the ""future"" of what is to come, uses his light power to inscribe some prophecy text. His text will be passed down from one guild to another, until it is endowed upon young Mavis. The ancient text is known as Lumen Histoire, or History [written of] Light. The treasure of Fairy Tail.

**TL;DR**: Timetravel can get very convoluted. There will be 2 Rogues from different timelines duking out."	t5_2s9z2	True

First of all; I simply love the music in the Fairy Tail anime. For me, music makes up at least 50% of the enjoyment of watching an anime. After I reached the latest episode of Fairy Tail, I couldn't stop listening to the soundtrack! And whenever I listened to it, I wanted to watch more episodes! 

Alas, no more episodes are to see, and I can't stand waiting a whole week for 20 minutes of Fairy Tail. So I decided to start watching other series. 

I searched the web for people's opinions on animes that Fairy Tail fans also enjoyed watching - with One Piece as number 1.
So I started watching One Piece, and it is awesome! But there is a problem.

**THE MUSIC DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE MUSIC IN FAIRY TAIL...**

This is a problem for me. I have literally not found any anime with music as epic as Fairy Tail. I've watched all of Naruto + Shippuuden aswell. I have to say, the music in Naruto is quite awesome BUT still doesn't reach Fairy Tail's level.

So far, it has only been 1st generation Dragon Slayers (even though Rouge is technically a 3rd generation, he was a 1st generation to begin with). So what will happen to Wendy??

She is the only Dragon Slayer left without 2 attributes, so when will she get the 2nd attribute? I think that she will get the Poison Dragon Slayer Magic (can't remember the name). The reason is because Natsu got Laxus (a 2nd gen), Gajeel got Rouge (a 3rd gen), and Rouge got Sting (a 3rd gen). So that means that it isn't symmetrical... And I think we know how much mangka **LOVE** symmetry.

So what do we already know? 

1) Eclipse. Because of this there is the chance that Rogue could go back in time 400 or so.

2) Zeref knows Natsu. During the Tenrou Island arc Zeref cries when he sees Natsu and hopes that one day he will destroy him. Zeref/Rogue could be thinking this way because Natsu has already beaten him during the games.

3) Their appearances are rather similar. See link below.

[Zeref and Rogue](http://i.imgur.com/eUVZZBS.png)

4) Zeref and Rogue from what we've seen so far appear to be friendly and don't particularly want to harm anyone (I will explain why Zeref is ""evil"" later on).

5) As of chapter 317 Rogues shadow has a personality/power of its own and is wanting to lend its power to Rogue so he can kill Gajeel. Rogue seemed surprised at the shadows sudden appearance, suggesting it isn't an event he has encountered before. 

6) The shadow is presumably evil and manipulative. Which is the ""evil"" side of Zeref, which is why he can't control his powers and ends up killing. This could also suggest that Zeref is infact being possessed by the shadow in the same way that Jellal was.

So that is my theory so far. I don't think I've missed anything out but if I have I will add it in later.

I know it isn't the best theory but I would love to see your thoughts on this.

1371330079.0	1gf2n7	Speculation about fate of Ultear and Chapter 336.	SplitFireify	38	8	18	"So this is my first time posting to Fairy Tail reddit and i apoligize my English in advance.

In chapter 334 Gray was killed. In chapter 335 it is told that Ultear knew some sort of ancient spell that would turn back time in cost of users life. Ultear felt herself worthless and decided to save everyone by turning time back by few hours, time before the gates were opened. She only managed to turn back time by one minute. 

I think that we could think it like she gave one minute of her life to every single people in Fiore.In Fiore there is 17 million inhabitants, so she gave 17 million minutes of her life. That equals 32,34 years, so she would have lived to age about 55-60 years old. 

Giving one extra minute to every peoples lifetime which could be though that she rewinded every peoples consciousness back by one minute because everyone knew what had  happened that minute that they had already lived, as they had ""vision"" of their future(in different timeline).

She also sent her consciousness back in time as she saw the clock showing one minute to half two. So she gave herself one more minute to live before her life time would run out.

So there is three possibilities that could happen in next chapter:

1) Ultear will die and many Ultear fans will be pissed.

2) Meredy uses some kind of advanced sense-link magic and shares her life time with Ultear and saving her.

3) Mashiro come up something that will be totally unpredictable

Natsu, Wendy and Gajeel were actually from 400 years ago.

On year 777, Arcadios attempted the previous eclipse plan, and the ""sacrifice"" was Lucy's mother. (At beginning he did say the last time, a celestial mages life was taken). For some reason the plan failed, however it did create a portal to 400 years ago. For some reason, the dragons send their children through the portal, perhaps to protect them from opposing dragon herds. When Natsu, Wendy and Gajeel arrived the future, they asked the people in town and been told it was year 777, 7th of July, thus they think their dragon disappeared on this day. bt in fact they were sent 400 years after and arrived on 777,

Another theory is that the dragon slayers spent their time with dragon in celestial world. They entered the celestial world with their dragon when young, and spent 5 years in the celestial world, which is equivalent of 400 years in Earthland. 

Either way, one thing can be sure that Natusl and Gajeel had connection with past and not from current era. When Fried set up the rune prison for people over 80, Natusl and Gajeel wasent able to get out, suggesting their ""real age"" is significantly higher than they look. Also, Zerefs recognise Natsu, means somehow Zeref already knew him from 400 years ago. "	t5_2s9z2	True

1. I am from Germany so excuse my bad english
2. i hope i can tell you atleast about the feelings i had watching Fairy Tail.


So where do i start? mhm its not easy, actually i just had finished watching SAO and Accel World and i was looking for a new anime to watch (i used to watch anime in my spare time and just like once in a while), then i got my attetion into Fairy Tail because i like magicians and this stuff. But after i started watching the first episodes i realized this is something bigger, it's not only about sorcerers and witches...


It's about having trust in your Friends, having fun even in bad times, respect, never giving up... and actually there is no ending to this list. It feels kinda hard expressing my feelings about this anime, but this anime told me so many things about life and even if the world isn't real, i feel like that the people in this anime are so filled with emotions...


And now i am finished with the existing 175 episodes, but i am not sad. Actually i am pretty happy about what they taught me. Many people might think i am crazy or stuff like that, but if i had to pick 3 things that FairyTail taught me, they would be: 

1. Believe in your friends  
2. Stand up for your friends if you need to  
3. Though our paths may have diverged, you must continue to live out your life with all your might, you must never consider your own life to be something insignificant, and you must never forget about your friends for as long as you live. And now that the anime is paused, i started learing japanese and drawing manga.


Sorry for this Wall of text haha :), i tried to give you guys my point of view.  
  

**THANK YOU FAIRY TAIL** for everything you gave to me.... 


May Natsu Dragneel become the strongest Dragon ever!


Sincerly,
a Fairy Tail fan

I'm the extremely silent CSS wizard who loves posting fairytail fan art from time to time. I also mod a lot of other subreddits. But enough about me. Lets get down to the good stuff.

Since /u/EveryNameUnavailable just requested to update the up &amp; down arrows... those got updated! Kickass! You all can thank /u/DezTiny &amp; /u/EveryNameUnavailable for the great idea.

---

Since we've grown quite a bit, how about we the community come up with a sexy and custom banner. Here are the rules.

1. The banner must be made by you, yourself.
2. The banner must be atleast 1920px wide by 200px high.
3. The banner needs to use high quality pictures.
4. If you don't know photoshop or similar program, don't bother.
4. The banner needs to have the cast of fairy tail guide in it.
2. You can use any and all pictures of fairy tail guide members.
5. The banner has to be Safe For Work.
6. The banner needs to be a little boring on the left side about 250pxs. (so to make the fairytail logo easy to see. See the present banner as an example)
7. Best banner wins. 
8. I decide the winner.

If you have any other questions I'll update the text post with an edit.

1348292834.0	10aczc	So I just caught up to Fairy Tail manga a few weeks ago. I love it, but here are the two big complaints I have with the story so far. 	NobleV	28	7	23	"They aren't ruining the story or be-all, end-all things, but I just, quite frankly, find them as bad writing. 

1. Lisanna. Her death was one of the best character developments in the entire story. It affected so many people, and was one of the best aspects of Natsu. You knew that loss affected him, and you felt so bad for him, not to mention Mira and Elfman. 
Then they bring her back to life......and it just kills all of that backstory and depth. Seeing her in Edolas was fine. It was almost like an aching of the past. I just can't believe they pulled it out to bring her back and ruin so much of the backstory for these characters. 

2. Jerral. He is/was everywhere. It's' not like his character is bad, but I mean, he's got Jerral, Seigrain, and Edolas version who are all characters. ( I know the first two are actually the same person). But I'm talking from a story standpoint, it's like you keep throwing a stray cat outside but it keeps coming back from a different direction. It was cool the first, and even the second time, but after the Oracion Seis arc, it was just too much. It's like that one kid that nobody wanted to pick for dodgeball, but somebody had to. And he just kept coming back. I feel like they were just looking for excuses to keep bringing him back into the story. Character deaths are great plot twists, backstory, and depth. 

These two provide so much for Natsu and Erza. Gray and Lucy have both experienced this, and I think their characters are better off for it. That's why I feel like the way they keep doing these two characters doesn't do them, or the people they affect in the story, justice. I feel like it's just trying a little too hard. 

I'd love to hear comments for other sides, as well. This is, obviously, just my opinion. "	t5_2s9z2	True

Gajeel does his normal iron arm to hit the dragon in it's face, but when rereading just now I noticed something odd. There were shadows laced around it. So just like how Natsu is the lighting-fire dragon slayer, is Gajeel now the iron-shadow dragon slayer?

If that is the case, that is fucking awesome. I love Gajeel and I really think he needed a power up.

ninja edit: I know we saw [here](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/fairy_tail/v26/c318/26.html) that Gajeel consumed the shadows of future rogue, but I assumed at the time it was only temporary. "	t5_2s9z2	True

This has got me thinking about Natsu, and how easily he over-powered sting and rogue together in dragon force using a unison raid. My theory is simply that because he was trained by a king dragon he is higher up then a normal dragon slayer. I have a few different variations going in my head right now.
- he could have eaten igneels flames, thereby giving him a permanent boost of power.
- it might be that the dragon slaying magic he learned was actually king dragon slaying magic

 And of course I could be entirely of base. I know they said it was the power of feelings that gave him the boost to win, but seriously he would have to have an innate ability or power level somewhat higher then sting and rogue combined in the first place. Lets not forget that he hasn't even touched dragon fore himself yet, and now he just ate ""hellfire"", which from atlas and future rogues reaction shouldn't be possible for a normal dragon slayer, hence all this rambling on my part :)"	t5_2s9z2	True

He feels the magic while Sheria and Wendy are battling, but the magic stays after the battle ends. Jellal senses the magic coming from what we later discover to be future Lucy, but doesn't catch her at the time.

Future Lucy (who I assume is genuine) didn't remember as much information as she supposedly told the Princess, and I agree with Arcadios that those tears were too real to be from an imposter. I also haven't pegged the princess as a liar.

Later the evil magic is shown to be possessing Rogue. After Gajeel defeats demon-Rogue (in epic fashion, I might add), the evil magic departs Rogue and he doesn't remember anything that happened while he was possessed.

My theory is consistent with all of this. I think the evil magic possessed future Lucy, using her to give false information to the Princess. The magic then left future Lucy, leaving her with the fragmented and incomplete set of knowledge future Lucy seems to have. The magic then possesses Rogue, and is now at large.

So neither the Princess, Arcadios, nor future Lucy are evil/bad characters. The Princess is simply making decisions based on false information presented to her by the demon-possessed future Lucy.

Thoughts?

**TL;DR** The evil magic possessed future Lucy, gave bad info to princess, left future Lucy for Rogue, and is now at large."	t5_2s9z2	True

1358114688.0	16igms	Speculation on where the current Arc is heading (Many Spoilers)	Vorgulremik	21	4	7	"After rewatching a few of the previous arc's recently, I have a few theories that I would like to bounce off people as to where the series is heading, so I'll do a quick rundown of some plot points and how i think they might mesh together.

1) The ""Eclipse"" doorway - basically a time travel device, as of the last chapter, we now know that the doorway no longer requires a celestial spirit wizards or any of the 12 keys, it is open, and ready to be utilized at any time.

2)Charla's vision - up to this point, none of Charla's visions have been incorrect, they have been misinterpreted in the past, but the one regarding Mecurius collapsing with Lucy inside was pretty clear, no other characters were seen to be present, and we almost conveniently have 2 Lucy's at the moment, which would suggest that all of the main characters are free to escape through the doorway, minus one of the Lucy's.

3) Dragonslayers Final form - We now know from the conversation with the Jade dragon, that the final form of Dragon slayer magic is when the human ""take son the appearance of a dragon, claws, a tail, and eventually growing wings, before becoming a dragon entirely"" as was the case with Achnologia., This transformation occurs when the dragonslayer in question ""bathes in the blood of a dragon"", whether this means hey have to kill the dragon or litterally bathe in its blood we don't know, but the appearance of sting and rogue would imply the latter (unless they are lying about killing their parents)

4) The Spirit World - We know due to that one puzzling episode that time in the spirit world passes over 90x faster than in the real world (3 months = 1 day), I refuse to believe Mashima dropped this tidbit of information for no reason, he could have simply shown the mian cast emerging from Tenrojima a few weeks/days before the Daimatou Enbu, instead of over three months, we know that residing in the spirit world the main characters could theoretically live out the 400 year gap if they were to use the eclipse gate, in just over five years, I think it's perfectly plausible that the future Lucy we have seen thus far could be five years older.

5) Freed's runes - way back in the Thunder festival arc where natsu and Gajeel are trapped behind a wall of Freed's runes, the condition barring their way is listed as ""those over the age of 80 may not pass"", leaving only themselves and the master unable to compete, everyone else is able to pass through freely.

So that's what we know so far, mercurius will be destroyed, and the possibility is there for the eclipse gate to be used to travel the 400 years required to confront Zeref while he is mortal, and still make it back to the present day via the spirit world, this could also explain why the spirits are so comfortable with the idea of bringing the fairy tail bunch into the spirit world, as this would serve as a convenient ""time marker"" for the past characters to disembark into the normal world. This would also be consistent with Freed's runes not allowing Natsu and Gajeel to travel past the ""younger than 80 years only"" barrier, since they would technically be over 400 years old. However, there is one more thing, which stikes me as a bit of a long shot......but

6) Zeref already knows Natsu when they first meet, despite Natsu having never laid eyes on him before. also, after Acnologia destroys tenroujima, we see Zeref looking upon the wreckage and muttering ""it's over eh, Natsu?"" and a few seconds later, we see Achnologia retreating into the clouds, what if this comment was directed at the black dragon himself, what if, in an alternate timeline (we know it's possible for the both to exist at once becasue of the double Lucy) for some reason, Natsu, through the slaying of dragons in the past, became Achnologia, at the very least, I believe that Achnologia is someone who we have already met in the show, I think there was a reason he didn't speak during his siege of Tenroujima, it would have given too much away.

Another wild theory, but it would conflict with the above, since we have never seen any of the slayers and their dragon ""parents"" in the same room, and we have been told numerous times that ""dragon slayer magic is identical to the dragons own magic"", it could be possible that Natsu / Gajeel / Wendy, ARE Igneel, Metallicana, Grandine, they become their dragon counterparts fighting in the war, 400 years prior, and either teach their young selves, or revert to the form of a child somehow, losing all of their memories, perhaps this could only be achieved on a certain date (7/7/7) which is what makes the timeline special)

Again I stress, these could all be wild theories, but I feel they could have a grain of truth at least in them.

TLDNR; - I compare a few points people may have forgot about / overlooked and use it to take a wild stab in the dark and suggest that Natsu may be Achnologia / young Igneel.

Gajeel is a fellow Dragon Slayer and a former S-class wizard when he was in Phantom Lord. He's pretty much the Vegeta to Natsu's Goku. But he's being portrayed more like a Yamcha. 

Now, I guess you could say the same thing about why Laxus isn't on the team. I would guess he's being trained by Makarov to be the next Master, so there's that. Or maybe Gajeel's busy going on dates with Levy while Natsu &amp; co. are away. That would be fine with me.

Just a quick definition of each type of Dragon Slayer.

* First-Generation or ""Old-Style"" (Learned from a Dragon)
* Second-Generation (""Learned"" from implanting Dragon Lacrima)
* Third-Generation (Learned from a Dragon and has had Dragon Lacrima implanted into their body) 

*Although it is stated that Sting and Rogue have killed their dragons, Lector's explanation of them maintains that to be considered a Third-Gen one must be trained by a dragon and have Dragon Lacrima implants*

.. And I apologize in advance for my TL;DR's that may actually require TL;DR's of their own.

In terms of power, Second-Gen's have been shown to be the weakest as their magic is merely a mimicking of Dragon Slayer magic. I think that First-Gen's and Third-Gen's power potentials are equal but it all actually boils down to the skill of the Dragon Slayer, Natsu and Gajeel, two First-Gen's, wiped the floor with Sting and Rogue, two Third-Gen's, while only sustaining minor injuries.

**TL;DR Potential Power Levels: First-Gen = Third-Gen &gt; Second-Gen**

Although in terms of Dragon Slayer abilities/capabilities it seems that Third-Gen's have easier access to some skills. Sting and Rogue have been shown to be able to effortlessly activate two powers, ""Drives"" and initiating Dragon Force. Neither Natsu nor Gajeel have been shown to have the ability to activate their ""Drive."" Natsu is the only First-Gen shown to have entered Dragon Force, but this only occurred twice: once after eating pure Etherion and again after eating Jellal's Flame of Rebuke.

**TL;DR Third-Gen's seem to have more (ease of access to) Dragon slayer capabilities than First-Gen's/Second-Gen's**

I have a feeling that Sting and Rogue's ability to activate a ""Drive"" and Dragon Force is because of their implanted Dragon Lacrima. It has been shown that Second-Gen's, Laxus and Cobra, are able to enter a weaker form of Dragon Force by simply activating their Dragon Slayer abilities. 

With that in mind, I feel that the since it is implied that Sting and Rogue had Dragon Lacrima implanted after having been taught by their dragons, the Lacrima simply granted them access to activating ""Drives"" and Dragon Force rather than giving them a power boost.

**TL;DR Dragon Lacrima augments a person's Dragon Slayer magic, so it ENABLED Sting and Rogue, who were already Dragon Slayers, ""Drive"" abilities and truer forms of Dragon Force than that of Second-Gen's.**

But I'm also leaning towards the idea that Sting and Rogue's forms of Dragon Force are still not as strong as that of Natsu when he consumed the Etherion and The Flame of Rebuke. I'm thinking that those substances enhanced Natsu's power, allowing him to achieve Dragon Force rather than simply giving him the power. I mean, Dragon Lacrima is specifically called Dragon Lacrima so it specifically augments a wizard in Dragon Slayer magic. So I'm under the impression that once Natsu, or any other Dragon Slayer, is able to activate Dragon Force of their own will, it will be on par with Natsu's Etherion/Flame of Rebuke Dragon Force, if not better. Probably better.

**TL;DR Etherion/Flame of Rebuke boosted Natsu to ACHIEVING the truest form of Dragon Force to date.**

But a good amount of that is simple speculation, so we'll have to see what's in store for us in the next couple of chapters.

**Super TL;DR The type of Dragon Force Natsu initiated is still probably the most powerful one to date.**

So, I probably do not keep up with Fairy Tail as much as you fine folk, so I figured I would come here to ask a question I have been trying to figure out....

What do we know about Zeref for fact? The way I understand it:

1) Zeref comes on the seen several hundred years ago

2) He is evil and powerful, but people manage to ""seal"" him somehow, or at the very least his evilness 

3) He wanders the world and ends up in the Island

4) GH and FT fight on the island, leading to Zeref... well, I don't know. 

I remember him saying something about not being able to control his death magic if he values human life, but at the same time he accuses Hades of making him forget the value of human life and therefore must be punished. Seems like,  if he did not want people to die, he would be thankful for having GH taking away the random explosions of death magic. 

[5) Finally, he talks to Mavis about wanting to kill everyone. Why the sudden change in regards of not wanting to be an ally or enemy to anyone, as he says as he is leaving the Island? ](/manga)

So, to kind of summarize, my three real questions are:

Was Zeref ever really sealed?

How does the weight of human life affect his magic?

Why does he suddenly want to kill everyone?

Like I said, if some of these things have not been answered yet, my mistake. I just did not know if I missed something obvious here or have my time line of his life screwed up."	t5_2s9z2	True

*6*.A rank of 5 in any stat will be equivalent to a normal level of wizard. A rank of ten in any of the stats would be considered a paragon of that skill, such as Eriza in Magic Reserve.

*8*.There are limits to your power levels. No one-shot kill technique without some sort of restriction. (WARNING: if spell is too Over-Powered, I will ask you to either put some restricions on it or to get rid of it.)

*9*.You will be able to make a case for yourself against your opponent when you match comes around.

*10*.Be realistic. If you have normal spell levels, don’t expect to be able to be able to whip up fire tornados out of nowhere without some major side-effects. Remember that all the points you put into one stat have to be taken out of another.

*11*.Absolutly **NO** Dragon Slayers. They are too Over-Powered. If your try and substitue for it, I will have to ask you to replace it or put restricions on it.

I gotta say though, out of all the anime's and manga's I've watched and read. This probably one of the few Adaptions where I'm more interested in the female protagonist's strength.

First, some info about Tartaros.
There are 2 kinds of guilds, Light and Dark Guilds. Fairy Tail, Blue Pegasus, Lamia Scale, Mermaid Heel, **Sabertooth** etc. are Light guilds, or Guilds approved by the council. 

Dark Guilds: Eisenwalt, Nakend Mummy, Dead Head Causus, etc...
(NOT Phantom Lord, they were a legal guild, but are disbaned).

Dark Guilds are Guilds who are not accepted by the council. They are like criminal organizations (in the eyes of the council). Dark Guilds are not just free roaming guilds and can't do whatever they like. 

The Balam Aliance controles them. A [picture](http://imgur.com/orDi8) Reedus drew is explaining the ""status"" of the Dark Guilds. 
Each Dark Guild is controled by one of the 3 Balam Aliance Guilds.

-Oracion Seis

-Girmore Heart

-Tartaros

Oracion Seis has been defeated by the Light Team (Nirvana Arc)

Girmore Heart has been defeated by the top members of Fairy Tail. (Tenrou Island Arc)

Tartaros... Where is Tartaros?

My theory:
Tartaros has already made an appearence. Not officialy by name, but they are already in the serie for quiet a while.
I think they might have Infiltrated Sabertooth. 
Sabertooth might be a Light Guild (yes guys, they are evil like sh*t, but they are still a Light Guild), but don't you think it is odd, that right after Fairy Tail (the strongest guild in Fiore) disappeard, Sabertooth appeard out of nowhere. Their Master Jiemma is a brute master who don't even care about his own members, just like a Dark Guilds master. 


What I'm saying here does not mean that all of the members of Sabertooth KNOW that they are *infiltrated* by Tartaros. I even think that Sting and Rough have no idea about this either. They just want status and Jiemma told them probably, if they joined Sabertooth, they would get a lot. 

Tartaros, as last of the Balam Aliance need to be carefull, because they don't have any ""friends"" that can help them, so they decided to ""dissapear"" and try to ""take over the world"" (or whatever their intension is) in a legal way. 


This is acctualy everything I can say about my theory. Sorry about my grammar and spelling, English is not my native.

1340052373.0	v8pfo	Crime Sorciére and Hoteye [Partly a spoiler]	ZeUplneXero	14	2	5	"[So Meredy and Ultear created an independent guild called Crime Sorciére during the timeskip. They broke Jellal out of prison and made him a member.](/manga) The question is, you know how Hoteye got influenced by the Nirvana and became a good guy? They took him to the prison at the same time as Jellal. They weren't near each other in prison, as we can see while Jellal was being tortured by a guard during the Erza vs. Azuma fight. But Hoteye was definitely still there, obviously, and as the only one ""good"" member of Oración Seis, they might have broken him out as well.
There are three options:

* Either they broke Hoteye out and made him a member, because he was ""good"", which is likely due to Mashima's Rule No.1 is that friendship, love and being good always wins (unfortunately, that has caused many battles to turn out irrationally only so that FT would win, an example being Natsu and co. vs Hades),

* or he remained there, as the influence of Nirvana already wore out - as it did with Sherry -

* or Mashima just forgot about him.

I think 1. is likely to happen due to the fact I already mentioned and the fact that Millianna is in there looking for Jellal, and Hoteye is looking for Wally, which is a friend of Millianna, and so on and so on. I dunno guys, say what you think."	t5_2s9z2	True

So the wall art of the dragon king festival. It shows a man wearing a similar scarf to Natsu fighting a dragon. My theory is that this is Igneel as a dragon slayer, before he became a dragon.

This really just popped into my head and I felt the need to share and see what others think.

**Edit:** OK after reading the manga again we are told Zeref is responsible for the Dragon transforming. I still think I'm right Only now I believe Igneel didn't murder countless dragons to transform. I'd say he used his own magic to mimic Zeref's and as he didn't want to transform another human he just used himself. Further more I think Natsu may actually be Igneel's real son. Using magic similar to fairy sphere Natsu was frozen in time and Igneel did not release him until such a time as he was needed, giving him 20 years(about this) to grow into a strong wizard to fight against Zeref and Acnologia. this is why the age spell affected him and also why Zeref knew about Natsu."	t5_2s9z2	True
1362705960.0	19vtdi	Lucy's possibilities	SolidHollow	14	1	31	"So, basically, We've seen all 12 gates for the celestial spirits plus the mysterious 13th gate that proved useless against Kagura. So, i am sure, soon that Lucy will take possession of all those gates (or rather keys). So Then whats next for lucy in terms of battle abilities. 

Something i have observed is that Lucy's powers are kind of similar to jellals as they deal with ""comsic"" stuff. Jellal deals with constalations and meteors and shit while lucy has the horoscope stuff as well as that ""Urano Metria"" spell that has something to do with planets. So i was thinking could there be more GATES or KEYS lucy could get that would be equal in strength to the twelve zodiac keys? 

I was thinking there could be keys that unlocked weapons so basically lucy could bring out Taurus and then open up a weapon gate so instead of him using his big axe he would use whatever weapon she summoned like a mystical sword or some shit. Or could we possibly see a chinease zodiac soon with Dragon, rooster, serpent, ram and all those other ones that kind of go AGAINST the traditional zodiacs and then lucy somehow brings them together. Almost like some sort of seperation in the spirit world. I dunno. 

TL;DR i just want to know how you think lucy's powers will develop after she gets all 13 celestial spirits. I know she uses dual casting to summon two but after she gets all 13 is that it for her in terms of growth? what do you think. "	t5_2s9z2	True
1361902343.0	199rp0	Natsu and Lisanna (kind of spoilers if you're not past Edoals Arc)	iSoder	16	2	12	"I'm kinda new to fairytail and was hugely dissapointed that the series didn't go in depth with them when they re-unite. 

I mean something that really gave depth to Natsu was that he had experienced loss, Lisanna. Aside from the romantic implications she was his closest friend before Happy, and they remained very close even after Happy was born and until her death. 

Then as he meets her again he is, rightly so, excited. Then as she dissapears he has other things to worry about (being powerless, all his other friends in the guild being in trouble, etc, etc) which is all good.

But at the end of the arc when she shows herself and explain that she is actually the Earthland Lisanna he seems kinda excited ofcourse to have her back but only a little. He actually seems more surprised than excited. 

It's like she's this huge important person which has influenced his life so deeply came back and then she becomes this background character like Levy, Mira and Gajeel. Still part of the core Fairy Tail group but not in the main focus (""Team Natsu"").

There were some romantic implications too that I don't really feel like they dealt with. 

I mean Wendy has a bigger role and she's kinda new to Fairy Tail. Don't get me wrong I like Wendy but I feel like considering Lisannas importance to the main character (Natsu) she would have a bigger role over all. 

Sorry if this became a little long, I was just dissapointed that Lisanna became a background character. 

**TL;DR** More Lisanna please

I mean, just look at /r/DBZ (almost 5x our size), /r/Naruto (over 6x our size), and /r/bleach (over 2x our size), /r/onepiece (over 3x our size). That might be because our ""Guild Master"" (/u/TickleSplits) has been inactive as of 5 months (with 1 post about 1 month ago)... also, /u/Necromas has been inactive for 10 days. 

This has got to stop, We need new mods. I want to see this sub get big, but it might be held back by the mods. /u/rya1111 and /u/SaltyChristian and /u/jaxspider have all been pretty active. So that's 3 out of 5 mods and 1 of the inactive mods is the creator of the sub! It saddens me to see this be happening. 

I think that we need to either:

1. Overthrow the inactive mods (maybe just the ""guild master"")

2. Get more mods (I don't really see this happening)

3. Complain/riot/ask the active mods what we should do.

4. Get a kick starter for the sub

5. Get more people from the anime/manga subs to watch FairyTail and join us.

I personally like #3, but that might just be because of the riots ;). /s

In all seriousness I think that the only way to get this sub going to use #1,3,4,5 so that we become larger and more of a community. FairyTail is a very good anime and manga. 

Here is what to say to people that watch other animes and want to get them into FairyTail: ""FairyTail starts off with really strong characters (Natsu and Eriza) and you don't have to watch them train to get stronger (like Naruto or Bleach). The fillers don't completely suck and some of them are pretty entertaining. Also, it just started so it is very easy to catch up. Just give it a try, you might like it.""

Name: Scott Grind (19)

Bio: raised by my grandfather in a small town he taught me how to build all sorts of contraptions due to him being an inventor but by the age of six i had drawn the attention of the magic council with my own inventions, in fear that i would follow in my parents footsteps and work for a dark guild they attempted several times to kidnap me to mold into a worker for them, my grandfather managed to fend them off for years during this time he began to teach me light-creation magic and i combined my knowledge of inventions with it to create my own powerful style. at the age of sixteen my grandfather died in one of the councils raids i managed to escape only with his old pocket watch and a wrench stumbling my way to Lamia Scale were i joined to hide from the council.

Guild: Lamia Scale but wanting to join the regrouped Fairy Tail

Magic Type: Light Molding Magic Quick magic explanation: my creation magic differs from others in several key points the first being that it needs light to work because I'm taking the light away from the source to create the objects example if i used my magic using a fire as the source the fire itself would stop giving off light (but still have its other quality like heat) until my spell is broken or i lose consciousness. Second the strength of my spells is based off the amount of light i use in it. third i don't have to use all of the light from one source at once i could say only take half the light making the source 50% as bright then i could take more from it later for another spell. note my spells don't generate light they are a bright gold color and can be seen clearly in all or no light.

Equipment: goggles that allow me to see light sources better(how they look http://challenger70ta.deviantart.com/art/Steampunk-Goggles-182486137 ), 5 flash Lacrima (similar to a flash grenade),5 flare Lacrima (like a road flare), my grandfathers pocket watch( how it looks http://travelogue.travelvice.com/postfiles/2007-05-07_antique-pocket-watch-back.jpg ) and an old wrench ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3055/2833574999_cacff9503e.jpg used to fight)

Spells: 

1. light-make Rivet it has the same functionality as ice-make lance http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Ice-Make:_Lance 

2. light-make Box simiar to ice-make block but created around myself or objects http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Ice-Make:_Block 

3. o.c. light-make piston I create a piston out of light to crush, push or launch objects/people 

4. o.c. light-make gears I create up to 10 spinning gears that can connect to each other to spin faster increasing their strength 

5. o.c. light-make golems i create 2 man size golems that assist me they are slightly weaker then me however they can use my magic (not this spell) but it drains my power and has the same effects to the surroundings as mine (I know what they see)

Trump: Dark Light: after i have used all the light or it has all been taken away by a spell i start to use my Lacrima to quickly generate my own temporary light sources to fight the flash ones for a quick powerful strike and the flares to be used over time.

Weakness: no light means no more spells, my pocket watch is incredibly valuable to me, gets a bit distracted at times

1359148657.0	17a0m8	[Spoilers] Erza fight prediction [Spoilers]	paranoid_coder	13	1	7	"All of this is spoilers!! manga and anime
So, most of us are disappointed about Kagura vs Erza. However I think this fight was thought out in advance, which might make it worth while...

Erza mentioned in 280, right after the fight with yukino http://www.mangapanda.com/fairy-tail/280/21

""There was someone like that here, huh"" (almost seems like a forced translation...)
However, in the anime, it was translated more as: 
""I didn't think there was somebody like that"" -- along these lines

As Erza is getting her butt kicked she says, again: http://www.mangapanda.com/fairy-tail/314/13 ]
""i'm surprised, I didnt think there was anybody like you""

Now, Erza could be referring to her power, but it's not like this is the first wizard she's seen who's more powerful. Nah, it's gotta be something more...
I think she is taking note of Kagura's power coming from her need for vengeance for Simon.

We're close to my conclusion, hang in there...


Erza doesn't say that about Kagura when Milliana tells her about the sword.. she said it both before and after Milliana mentioned it. Because Erza says this before Milliana, I think this suggests Erza recognized the blade, Archenemy. Erza is a weapons master after all.

Not only do I think Erza recognizes the blade, i think she has one.
I think Erza is surprised somebody could wield that sword so often, as it likely feeds off of resentment, hence Archenemy is called ""The Blade of Resentment"".

To this point, we haven't really seen Erza's main motivation as resentment at all. It's always been to protect, or for her nakama. 

However, everyone Minerva has been holding captive or tortured is totally safe now, there's no need for protection. I think the author wanted to make Minerva seem as evil as possible, as to make sure Archenemy did not lose significance.  Erza wants revenge, and has enough resentment at the moment to wield archenemy.

Let me know what you think, or your own theories below! Criticism is welcome!

Even if i'm wrong, we all know Erza will get her revenge, as predictable as it may be.

My full opinion about her: Her story is acctualy pretty good. Lisanna is Natsu his childhood girlfriend. They raised Happy and they were a couple (not official, but everyone knew their relationship). Her ""death"" was also one of the most sad things that happend in the story and it was also a plot breaker. Mira went from total bitch into the lovely Mira we know. Elfman became more manly, because he was supposed to protect Mira, something he never could and eventualy ment the death of Lisanna. If something changed for Natsu... No not realy, but we never got into Natsu, after the Lisanna story, so I leave this open.

When Lisanna came back, everybody was realy happy... But where did that happiness go? **Name one thing, besides of the reappearance of Lisanna, that changed for the characters.**

We all though, this whole bringing back of Lisanna will probably meen a new begining of NatsuXLisanna, but nothing, I realy mean NOTHING happend between them. The only thing Lisanna said about Natsu was against Lucy: When Natsu is surounded by friends, he will get much stronger. (or something like that).

So the question to you: Is the whole character Lisanna a plot making character or compleetly useless? Like I said, I am neutral about her, but she does still intrest me. I call her both. Plot making, because she still has a lot of potential for future arcs. And Useless, because her addition after Edolas is less then 0. I think she is damn lucky to be chosen by Juvia as her partner and being part of the time skip.

Yesterday, I was babysitting and when the kid had to sleep he asked me to read a bedtime story for him. I took a look trough his books and I noticed it were te same books as usual. I rememberd a story I read some time ago, by **Hiro Mashima**, of a ""Real"" Fairy Tale story. Not Fairy Tail but Tale.

This was a project he did inbetween Rave Master and Fairy Tail. It was a volume with a lot of short stories, including this Fairy Tale.

I thought it would be nice to read this story for him and he was realy excited about it. I have to say, he was 10 years old, but sometimes the pictures are a bit ""scary"". Don't show it to children under 10 is my tip.

1345275273.0	yf5b8	Yet another theory about the Dragon Slayers and Zeref.	Hoali	18	6	10	"Sorry for the length.

I was going back through and watching some of the anime. I watched the episode in the Tenroujima arc where Carla and Happy destroy Hades' heart. So here's my theory:

If Hades needs the heart to perform his magic, magic that was described as the magic that is used by Zeref, could it be possible that Zeref himself has an external heart that feeds his power and keeps him young? Once you make that assumption, another question needs to be answered. If he does indeed have an external heart, where is it? Which, theoretically, would be easy to answer. Acnologia. Acnologia is the source of Zeref's power. Now I know that most would have come to this conclusion already, but it bears repeating. Because the next logical step from said assumptions is that if Acnologia, a dragon, is giving Zeref his power, does that mean that the other dragons are sources of power themselves? Also, does this make Zeref a Dragon Slayer as well? The Death Dragon Slayer?

A couple of pieces of evidence to support this is that Zeref seems to know where Acnologia is, or at least when he's headed towards him. Another is that without being there, Zeref seemed to know that Wendy was going to attempt communication with Acnologia. Lastly, they both seem to occupy the same general role as apocalyptic chaos starter. They both tend to destroy whatever they come in contact with, Acnologia for shits and giggles and Zeref because he's upset. A bit weak I admit, but it still makes sense.

While I realize that most of this is based on assumptions, none of it is far fetched. If this were true, it would account for the Dragon Slayers' ages; Their hearts keep them young. All of the Dragon Slayers (I'm including Zeref in this category from now on) are a lot older than their apparent physical ages. Zeref himself is confirmed to be hundreds of years old. And it was said that Hades' heart is the source of his longevity. Assuming that Hades' link to his heart is of the same type as the Dragon Slayers' links, it makes sense that they have longer lives due to their hearts. It doesn't account for the apparent amnesia however. It could be that the dragons caused the amnesia in their respective ""children"". Amnesia, of course, referring to the fact that none of the known dragon slayers, outside of Rogue and Sting, seem to remember having interactions with the others before the current timeline in the manga/anime.

I had one more thought about the heart linking, as it were; It's the possessors, the dragons in this case, of the individual hearts that dictates the powers received by the wizard being linked to them. The Dragon Slayers, once linked to their respective ""parents"", were given the powers associated with the type of dragon they are. This would lend credibility to the claim that Zeref is in fact a Dragon Slayer. Acnologia is pretty much the harbinger of death and Zeref uses Death Magic. But this begs the question: How did Hades make a heart and why did it give him the powers it did? My theory is Hades found out about the link between the dragons and their slayers and went about finding the magic to create a heart of his own. And while making the heart, he was able to program it with the magics that he wanted to use. 

Again, I realize that this is a lot of speculation, but it seemed to fit. I'd love to hear what you all have to say. Comments, rebuttals, questions, things I've missed. It's all welcome. Cheers.

Also, sorry if this is a repost, or has been brought forward before.

I wanted to add something that is based off the above theory with regards to Gen 3 Slayers such as Sting and Rogue. If the above theory and Sting's and Rogue's claims about killing their ""parents"" are accurate then where is their magic coming from? Why do Sting and Rogue still have Dragon Slayer powers if their hearts no longer beat? I think it's the lacrima that were embedded in their bodies. The lacrima are substitutes for the hearts. Which would give a somewhat better explanation regarding Gen 2 Slayers. An explanation that goes beyond they just have lacrima in them so it works. It gives it a bit more depth. This would also kind of explain why they're able to control Dragon Force. They're in control of their ""hearts"", their sources of their power. Again, this is all speculation. I may be completely wrong. However, it seems to fit and the clues are there, though I may have stretched them a bit too far. Time will tell I suppose.

[Having since read the most recent manga I feel that at least some of what was written above may not be correct. It has been alluded that Sting and Rogue may not have actually killed their dragons, but instead were lying about it the whole time. The theory above about the lacrima giving them control of the source of their power, to me, remains valid. It could possibly boost the connection with their hearts, giving them the ability to enter Dragon Force at will.](/manga)

Edit: Expanded on a few things, fixed the wording, and fixed some grammatical errors.

Edit 2: Added the theory about Gen 3 Slayers.

Just an idea but it could be that there is a 3rd Rogue who is corrupted by some evil and just calls himself Zeref. Like in the new chapter it showed that timeline and the 3 possibilties. The 3rd possibility Rogue could be a Zeref, which would sort of explain how he knows Natsu

So it's said that all the dragons disappeared...or that they died off. Instead what if they all just entered this door :l   So basically they didn't disappeared they just traveled to this moment in time. 

Now if its played right they here's what could happen.


The dragons come out and a select group of  others are drawn in. So natsu, Lucy and..ect...ect...doesn't really matter who gets sucked in as long as natsu is with them. So now a few fairy tale members are in the past and the dragons rule the future. But what about future Levy's writing saying that some people died? This could be a misunderstanding and they just assumed they died because they couldn't find them. (Because they were ported to the past.)  Now the series could switch between the future and the past telling two stories. One, the struggles of the survives against the dragons. (This could be pretty cool and maybe every once and a while they slay a dragon?) Then two, they tell the story in the past of natsu and the others. Natsu would be adventurin around trying to find out how to get back to the future...or trying to stop Zeref? In this process he meets himself as a child and is confused. This could reveal that he and the other dragon slayers were actually alive back then and were just ported to the future.

This most likely is not how it will turn out because of the part of the series where the dragons say- ""Maybe natsu and Wendy will get along this time.""... also when Natsu and Wendy first meet, Natsu says she seems familiar.   
So this probably means something along the lines of memory loss.

So that's my thoughts. What do you guys think?"	t5_2s9z2	True
1365105668.0	1boln0	Will this be a new arc? *Spoilers Inside* (Theory)	Tank_the_Tortoise	12	0	7	"[What this thread is about](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/fairy_tail/v26/c320/17.html)

I was just wondering because these four mysterious wizards are just mentioned and then Hiro Mashima doesn't talk about them anymore, which makes me believe that they will get another appearance later in the series.  

I also think that it may not be set in Fiore, but rather a different country. This is due to the fact of what [Lyon said](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/fairy_tail/v26/c274/9.html) in chapter 274 when Jura was fighting Jellal and since the [wizard saints don't have to be from Fiore](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/fairy_tail/v06/c047/13.html), but any country in [Earthland](http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/File:EarthLand.jpg), which I think is a continent that contains Fiore and the other countries.


I know that it might just be Lyon's opinion, but if even [Sherry knew about the four other wizard saints and how powerful they were](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/fairy_tail/v26/c320/16.html), then Lyon probably does as well.  So he wouldn't go bragging about Jura being the strongest in Fiore if he knew about four wizards who are that strong, so they must not be in Fiore.  

This could just be me hoping for more Fairytail and just being crazy, but I don't know.  What do you think /r/fairytail?

I'll start: I would use a magic called assassin magic. Examples: Camoflauge, Wood Dummy, Super Speed, Re-Equip: Blodd-Thirsty Katana, Silence, and Darkness. I would probebly be in the assassin Guild and be a S-rank wizard. My dream would be to assaninate a Consol Member and become the Guild Master. My most used spells would be Camoflauge (to sneak around and to be an assassin), Re-equip: Blood-Thirsty Katana (so that I could have a stong weapon), and Wood Dummy (to dodge attacks). I would mostly be alone so that I dont get caught so easily but sometimes work in a small group of 3. I would be weeak against nothing (can't think of anything). I would be strong against nothing (can't think of anything). I would look kind of bland with the stariotypical face mask with black eyes and my body will be clothed in all black and the color of my skin would be Natsu's skin. Nothing will get in the way of my dream, NOTHING.
Now it's your turn! but what magic you would use, spells of this magic, which guild, most used spells (5 max please [these are your ""most used"" so dont put tons of them]), dream, weak against, strong against, your apperence, and your moto. I can't wait to read these.

1340909108.0	vr5ix	Just a re-post of my Theory to help you all with yours. 	Crusnik909	16	3	2	"I'm seeing a lot of theory and prediction threads about how God Slayers, Zeref, and Dragon Slayers are all related. 


I posted this comment on /user/Theroy thread http://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/vg3i4/lost_magic_and_zeref_spoilers_288/


That's the closest idea I have as to what Zeref, Dragon Slayers, and God Slayers actually are. Here is what I said:


""Okay here's my input of what the Dragon Slayers happen to be. So we know Achnologia is at known as a Ancient Legend and the destroyer of worlds. He happens to be a black Dragon that takes life. We know at least three names of other dragons. Igneel being one of the. Know from Chapter 101 (http://www.mangastream.to/fairy-tail-chapter-101-page-7.html) we know that Grandine visited Igneel. Igneel said that he had Forbidden all interference (probably talking about contacting their kids). Grandine said Natsu was reckless like Igneel. That Wendy would meet Natsu and that Zeref coming back could not be avoided. We also know that Igneel got enraged by Grandine and asked if she really wanted to ""anger him."" That's when Grandine said that she ""Looks forward to seeing him again in the Dragon King Feast.""

Now looking at that conversation we can guess that Igneel has some superiority over the other Dragons. Maybe even over or equal to Achnologia. We know that Achnologia is feared and known in the history of the manga but we have no idea why he disappeared. We also know that Zeref was feared 400 years ago. And as OP states that Natsu is older than 80, maybe he's older than 400. So here is my guess. The Dragons are immortal along with their Dragon Slayers who live as humans, die and are reborn. Every (for guessing let us say) 100 years the Dragons have a competition or the Dragon King Feast. Maybe the compitition is between Slayers or maybe between both Dragons and their Slayers. I don't know. Which is based to find out who is superior and who can rule. Now if we guess that then we can guess that more than 400 years ago Achnologia ruled with his Slayer Zeref who feared Achnologia. Zeref created God Slayers to help destroy civilization so Achnologia (who hates humans) wouldn't appear to destroy it himself. That is until another Dragon and Slayer (Igneel and Natsu) fought back and beat them. Igneel becomes the ruler, Achnologia and Zeref are weekend and go into seperate hiding. Zeref runs from Achnologia as to keep him from competing in the next Feast. Igneel makes a knew rule saying ""No interference with humans until the next Feast"" but humans striving for power start researching Zeref and God Slayers making Achnologia and Zeref stronger. Now Zeref and Achnologia have returned and are ready for the next Dragon King Feast.

This is just me guessing though.""


Again this is just me saying what I think to all of your theory and prediction threads.

1338093124.0	u6wyv	[Events at the end of the Magic Tournament]/manga	jojomanjm	12	2	13	"As those who have been reading the scanlations of Fairy Tail, you are aware of the current magic tournament being held between the various guilds of Fiore.

There are several events that are expected to happen:
1. the ""eclipse"", which has something to do with the dark mage  Zeref and the stellar mages (Lucy from fairy tail and Yukino from Sabertoothe)
2. the Dragon king feast.  This is not actually stated , but is given some context by the date.  The magic tournament ends on 7/7 of whatever year it is, which is the date that the dragons left.  There are also 5 dragon slayers (Natsu, Gazeel and Wendy from Fairy Tail, Rogue and Sting from Sabertoothe).  Zeref is potentially a dragonslayer, or at least falls under that general category from the chapters that showed the dragon Acnologia at the end of the Fairy tale/ Grimoire Heart storyline, and the conversation between the sky dragon Grandine and the fire dragon Igneel in chapter 101.

read fairy tale ch. 101: http://www.mangareader.net/135-7216-1/fairy-tail/chapter-101.html

The first event is pretty clear about the stellar mage dying, and something about Zeref coming back (one of the recurring themes, although in the more recent chapters, it is made clear that Zeref never died, just went to ""sleep"").  I noticed the second by me being bored during summer break and rereading all of Rave and Fairy Tale (which is pretty much the rave characters put into a different storyline.  Seriously, just look at the similarities between Lucy and Resha/Elie, and Sieghart and Sieghart/Gerard/Mistgun) 

In chapter 101 of Fairy Tale, Grandine (who is shown as a glittery ball like navi) talking to Igneel.  Zeref's name is mentioned with Natsu and Wendy, and their conversation ends when grandine says ""I look forward to the day we meet at the dragon king feast"".

I think that the eclipse is the start of the dragon king feast, and that the dragon king feast, and the dragons also meet with the dragon slayers again., although I'm not sure how this will work for Sting and Rogue who supposedly killed the dragons who taught them dragon slaying magic.

It is also clear that the exceed cats (Happy and the other cats with wings) have some sort of attraction to dragon slayers, but I'm not sure what that could be.  Supposedly the exceed just encountered the dragon slayers by chance (except for Gazeel and Pantherlily) as was explained at the end of the Earthland/Edolas storyline by the queen of exceed and her advisors. Their relationship may be revealed at the end of the magic tournament when the eclipse and possibly the dragon king feast.

Ok so I don't think Gray is dead.  One of the huge themes of this manga/anime has been family and getting strength from your loved ones.  It hasn't been strength from them dying either seeing as Natsu has stopped Erza and Gray from sacrificing themselves in the past saying they should live for their friends, nor die for them.  If Gray dies protecting Juvia then that completely goes against the theme, so I don't think he's really dead.

Bio: Eve has suffered numerous hardships throughout her young life. Shortly after she was born her town was destroyed by one Zeref's demons. Both her parents were killed and she was left in the care of her sister. After travelling around, stealing to make ends met, she was eventually abandoned by her sister. The rest of her past remains a mystery of broken images and occasional flashbacks. The one consistency of her memory is that she seems to be prone to blackouts. She was brought to Lamia Scale at age eight by a member who stumbled across her during a mission. She has remained with the guild ever since.

Guild Affiliation: Lamia Scale

Magic Type: Caster Magic : Arcane

Equipment: Arcane Lacrima x 3

Spells:

•Cosmic Beam: http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Cosmic_Beam

•Arcane Wave (OC) (Eve emits a pulse of magical energy towards the opponent, this attacks causes no damage but knocks the opponent down and will causes them fatigue, multiple strikes can stun her opponent)
•Judgement (OC) (Encases enemies in a mist of arcane energy, causes no damage but restricts the targets ability to conjure spells, the effect persists as long as Eve is channeling the spell)
Trump Card: Arcane Scream (OC) - When wounded severely or sees an ally fall, Eve loses control, she envelopes herself in a bright cloak of arcane magic and enters a rage fueled state, resulting in a full out assault. She can not distinguish between freind or foe and will burn through her remaining magic reserves until she passes out, or if her opponent is defeated. This is the only time in which she will use her offensive ability, Cosmic Beam (-3 Stability, -1 to Intelligence +2 to Speed, +2 to Magic Reserves)

2.Iron skin. May be activated to...well...give him iron like skin.(Think Colossus from X-men but not nearly that strong) Lasts 5 minutes.

Trump Card: Reject Your Limits. Becomes enraged for a period of time and gains shockwaves for his attacks.

ThatsWhat-YOU-Think	15	2	17	At the poor progression rate for English fans, nothing outside the English-dubbed anime and manga will be released. No video games, no English dubbed anime. It's absolutely sad, because Fairy Tail has potential to be just as big as Naruto or Bleach. I think the biggest problem is a mainstream tv network. No anime in America gets very big unless it gets put on Adult Swim or Cartoon Network, but GOOD anime is becoming a rare thing on Cartoon Network, though the first season of Bakkugan was really great, look at Beyblades or Ben10 Omniverse.

The one where Gajeel goes Iron Shadow Dragon mode is both epic and terrifying, and the epicness of showing how he looks in that mode is just awesome.

If he does then this whole thing will carry more weight and mean that much more once its finished. It'll mean that from this point on anyone could be killed off and that adds more to the story. I personally have been getting kinda annoyed at how everything always works out but i know this isn't a very hardcore serious manga.

Dragon Festival arc, aka, Grand magic games - so far, excellent, well presented, except few fights which could spare more details, and the anime done well to cover those fights. 

Now, the latest chapter - Gray dies, and Ultear is in an emotional mess...

Yes, what will happen next I wonder - [TIME REVERSE NIGGA!](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101211220117/e4-misfits/images/6/62/The_misfits_curtis.jpg).

Its sound way too obvious that Ultear did not kill Rouge because she realise the fact that if she does, her atonment for her past crimes would be pointless, and then she realise shes sinful and a total JACKASS to everyone since shes the main villain of the show for like, 200+ manga chapters. So, shes gonna reverse time.. to what extent I dont know. Bt I bet my virginity on the line she will do it, and offer herself as a sacrifise, and will she die, I dunno then. its fairy tail, unpredictable since chapter 250ish  (apart from they won, thats predicable in every shonnen comic with exception of Sexy Commando)"	t5_2s9z2	True

The dragons are symbolic of Lucy's increasing actions, she's anxious though and doesn't want sex, that's why she's yelling to ""close the gate"" of Eclipse.

Cobra was never really in prison, Lucy locked him out of being a sexual option, which he managed to escape from.

Future Rogue and Future Lucy were just Lucy's imagination, the ""shot"" that killed Future Lucy was insemination, which would impregnate her and ruin her life thus ""dying""

and what happened with lucy and natsu in chapter 331 was her true desires being fulfilled. 

Also Happy comments on how brave Natsu was when he did that. This is representative of society and how it keeps forcing sex upon Lucy.

I figure it's time for me to give back a bit finally. I'd like to extend an offer to /r/fairytail for you all to join my Fairy Tail RP Forum. We're (currently) rather small, but we welcome all who wish to join us. Our copypasta advertisement below will give you a general idea of what the forum is all about. **Link is in the comments, since because text post.**

It is the year X224. The Age of Technology has ended. As constant war split apart the world there was only one destination for History and that was into destruction. Peace settled over the land as scholars turned to the Arcane rather than the Mechanical. Technology retired and Magic took over. The study of Magic is still in its adolescence, but already there are stirrings of war across the earth, emanating from and revolving around the country of Fiore. Gatherings of Wizards have been branded as Guilds, whether they are official and play by the rules of the Council or make their own rules designates them as Guilds of Light or Darkness. Throughout the constant struggle between official and mercenary Guilds, the Dragons watch over the land, their ancient powers sometimes slipping into play. 

In the midst of the politics, the fighting, and the brink of war on the horizon, where will you be? Will you take up a sword as a Rune Knight, a peacekeeper and enforcer of the Law of Fiore? Will you join an official, or an unofficial, guild to be a shaper of the World with Magic at your fingertips? Or maybe you will be one of the mystical Dragon Slayers, who wield the might of the most ancient of beasts at will. At Wings of Fairy Tail, an intermediate to advanced longhand roleplaying site, any of these options and more are available to you. The destiny of the World is, quite literally, in your grasp. Come stop by and join a growing community that is willing to include you and your ideas!

If you're unsure about wanting to join us, consider a few of the following reasons to join. The biggest thing we have to offer is that we're open to suggestions. The main job of our staff is to try and keep everything somewhat balanced, not run around telling people that they aren't allowed to do things. The outcome of fights is determined by your skill as a roleplayer, and the quality of your character, not by the roll of a die. We have a detailed stat system in place that helps roleplayers understand the various strengths and weaknesses of other characters without being too restrictive on creativity. This roleplay is set in an AU, and while that means you don't get to interact with the canon characters, that also means some really powerful magic types are up for grabs."	t5_2s9z2	True

Detroph	13	3	7	"There are plenty theories on how Eclipse is linked to all the first generation dragon slayers like Natsu,Gajeel and Wendy. These claim that they were send from 400 years in the past to x777 with Eclipse I , where apparently all dragons ""disappeared"". I personally think that this is very plausible. It is also said that a celestial spirit mage is needed to open the gate, neither Lucy nor Yukino helped opening the gate. But what if a celestial spirit mage is actually needed to close it, just as we saw it in the latest chapter (328). Also it seems that one is not enough so Lucy and Yukino were needed to close it.

Now comes the speculation. We know the gate might have been opened opened for the first time on the 7th july x777, the same day Layla Heartfilia died and the dragons disappeared. What if Eclipse I was closed by Layla Heartfilia all by herself and that she died using all her magical power.

Sorry there might be some spelling errors.


edit:

*Eclipse II is mentioned, so that confirms the existence of Eclipse I.

So Rouge claims that he killed his dragon, the shadow dragon, but what if he only thought he killed him, and his dragon took the form of his shadow to watch over him/escape from the dragon king. 

Here's where the exceed, and a lot of the conjuncture, theory comes in. I think that each of the Exceed has a latent ability, one which a lot of times even they don't know about. Carla's future vision, and pantherlily's transform come to mind.

 I think that Froad, upon meeting Rouge for the first time accidently unlocked his ability, to seal things away. He accidently sealed Rouge's dragon inside his shadow. Rouge's dragon then had to bide his time and wait for a moment when Rouge was weak so he could escape. Then he possessed Gajeel, in order to make Rouge seek to learn more about his shadow and release him.

Alternate: Froad has a dampening affect on Rouge's dragon, that's why it stayed as a shadow/ran away whenever Froud was near.

tl;dr:Rouge's shadow is his dragon and Froud is keeping it in check."	t5_2s9z2	True

After watching the new fairy tail episode I began to wonder about take over magic. Up until now I always thought that in order to gain a new 'soul' a person had to encounter it, and fight it or something along the lines of that? I don't know AHHA.

So then I began to wonder, how does Mirajane gain souls if thats the case? Does she go and fight demons?

I went and researched around wikipedia and it didn't really specify anything at all besides the fact that Elfman had to encounter beasts in order to transform into them. Nothing about Lisana or Mirajane

According to my friend in the Manga it says something along the lines of Mirajane already having Satan Souls within her but she discovers them through training or something.. Can anyone clarify?

So the main question here is 

"" How the hell does Take Over magic work, Is it different for Lisana and Mirajane? Or do they also have to encounter beasts too? ""

I'll start with mine. My favorite arc thus far was the Edolas Arc. Though it was obscure at first, the progression of the plot and character development in the arc was unparalleled.

The +80 (or was it +70?) thing has to do with the whole Laxus tantrum-arc where a seal is made that blocks anyone above 80 to leave the establ

[More information regarding Zeref if you wanna brush up.](http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Zeref#Tenrou_Island_arc)

Here are some interesting quotes from the wiki article above:

""At some time in the past, he apparently learned about Natsu and realized he could kill him someday. ""

""Zeref was shocked to see Natsu and says that he has ""really grown"", but Natsu didn't recognize him. When he tells the Fairy Tail wizards that he has been expecting Natsu's arrival, Natsu misinterprets this as a form of challenge and rushes towards him, landing a fierce blow to Zeref's face.""

""Just then his [Zeref's] Magic activates again but no one is killed, due to **Natsu's scarf** absorbing it.""

""As he walks he states that he had no reason to come to this age, and that he is neither an ally nor an enemy to anyone. He then says that **if an age is about to end** he may awaken again; he then wishes to be broken by Natsu before that time.""

""He blames Grimoire Heart for the summoning of Acnologia, claiming it will now end the current era.""

""Zeref then realizes mankind will be 'embarking on a long journey again', and says farewell to Natsu. Zeref watches Tenrou Island's demise. After Acnologia finally destroys Tenrou Island, and all of the Fairy Tail members on it, Zeref shuts his eyes, and comes to realize that it was finally over for Natsu, as the damaged airship keeps flying along.""

From Natsu's article:

""Igneel's Scarf: It is a scarf given to Natsu by his foster father, Igneel, and Natsu always wears it to remember him.[4] It is a white scarf that has scales on it. It is something similar to a charm that protects Natsu from misfortune. It shielded him againzt Zeref's Death Magic, but the exposure to the death Magic caused it turn black. During the time it was tainted, Wendy was unable to heal Natsu. In order to heal him, she had to reverse and remove the evil on the scarf.""

-------

So what I'm primarily looking for here are somewhat wild (or not) speculations. It'd be funny if someone called whatever it is that is happening with the dragons, dragon slayers, the feast, Zeref, Natsu, these ""ages"", etc; now. If we keep guessing, at least someone will be right, right?

My guess is that the dragon slayers are reborn continuously. Zeref, who was raising hell (literally) a couple of hundreds of years ago, knew Natsu back then and Natsu was a fierce champion who fought against him. That's why he was hoping Natsu could kill him.

But the question then also becomes why he was only mentioning Natsu, and not Gajeel or Wendy? Why not?

Also, whereas Wendy's surname is Marvell and Gajeel's surname is Redfox - two names that seem to be completely unrelated to their respective dragon foster(??? HMMM) parents, Natsu's name is a mix between Dragon + Igneel = Dragneel. Coincidence???

Second, among the dragons that have come through is Zirconis who is also a skeleton under the coliseum which means he must be sent back through the gate at some point.

So first, remember when Arcadios was originally portrayed as evil? He called Zeref, ""*LORD* Zeref"". And he saved Yukino and Lucy from the lava, when they were about to die, even if it meant getting in the lava himself. 

And then the princess was originally portrayed as wanting to save Arcadios, as well as Fairy Tail. Now, FL (Future Lucy), is also being very secrative. She did not arrive on the fourth! And FL also has told the Princess how Eclipse 2 can be used in destructive ways. So, FL either has an alternative plan, or is not FL at all.

Remember, Jellal sensed dark, mystical power coming from FL, and he followed her, and almost lost here. So that could mean, A, the intense power of Eclipse/Eclipse 2 is actually a very dark magic, and it lingered on FL after she uesd it. Or B, FL uses a dark and evil magic which is NOT Lucy's.

TL;DR: Future Lucy is either a really evil, non-Lucy, or she's a Lucy who saw something, and it changed her view on everything, and now she's being secretive about it.

EDIT:

Also, has anybody noticed how even though Sting is the White Dragon Slayer, he EATS white substances (Or something like light, brightness or whatever). Leaving only black substances. (Darkness and Shadows.) While Rogue eats the shadows/darkness, leaving only light. So could it be swapped around? Meaning Sting is more of an evil person, while Rogue is more friendly? This is also hinted at when Sting felt no remorse for Yukino leaving, while Rogue was a little put off by it. And Sting also went absolutely insane when it came to wanting to fight Natsu, and after Rogue's match with Gajeel, he didn't seem have the insane urge to do it anymore.

TL;DR Sting is bad, Rogue is good.

EDIT2:

When Rogue was being possessed by the shadow, did anybody else notice the [markings on his arms](http://i.imgur.com/twZJiiN.png) resembled that of Acnologia's? He also does have a slight resemblance to Zeref. Although we don't know much about the shadow, or at least, not enough to do any complete speculation or theories.

EDIT3: 

Also, in Kagura vs. Erza, they were talking about Jellal, and they didn't realize that everybody would see this? And the crowd does nothing when Erza sticks up for Jellal, or doesn't say ""no"" to the fact that they are guarding Jellal?"	t5_2s9z2	True

1340491102.0	vi11z	Which character do you think will die? Who do you want to die?	Cupcake_in_Acid	14	5	20	Well, obviously Master Makarov will die pretty soon. He's tangled with death way too many times. But, I want Iwan to die also. He's annoying, and his magic is useless. 	t5_2s9z2	True

After 136 episodes it seems like he still has the same strength he had when he started? For those that read the manga, is he going to get a power boost anytime soon?
Thanks."	t5_2s9z2	True

1339898249.0	v5um5	Talks about Raven Tail vs Laxus &amp; Obra	ChaotikTekTonik	11	2	12	From those who read about the chapter, how do you think the fight went between laxus and raven tail? I was surprised but at the same time amazed at laxus strength to defeat them all but was also disappointed since they are an anti-fairy tail guild and lost so easily. So about Obra, do you believe Obra is in/the black creature? Obra wasn;t moving at all and his body was weird. As well, the guards noticed something odd about him. We haven't saw obras full potential so I think we would very well see him again in the near future	t5_2s9z2	True

Even if they defeat all the dragons (even Acnologia has a chance to apperar), there is still Zeref and Tartaros dark guild (which hasn't got any action yet). There should be at least one arc for them.	t5_2s9z2	True
1371963470.0	1gw7qu	Sorry if this has been said before but this is a quick dragon slayer theory I have.	yellowflasher	9	2	13	"I'm not sure if this is just a bad translation or not but you [read this page](http://www.mangapanda.com/fairy-tail/329/9) can see the fire dragon (can't remember his name at this point in time) mentions that he can't be defeated  by a human. 

This could possibly be backed up during the Battle of Fairy Tail arc when the dragon slayers can't get past the barrier and then Igneel and Grandine are talking about Natsu and Wendy getting along ""this time"" which suggests they have met before.

TL;DR Dragon slayer aren't human 

I know it is a very short theory and poorly supported but this is the best I can do at the moment. I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Edit: Spelling and stuff."	t5_2s9z2	True
