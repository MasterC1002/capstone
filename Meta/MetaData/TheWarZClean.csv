1352678039.0	1318bc	I want to help you live longer in this game.  So come read these tips you NEED to know.	Tieryal	237	53	33	"I'm on one of my first weekends with this game and it's been a seriously frustrating and bumpy road.
  
  I wanted to make it less shitty for everyone else who has a chance to read this, so you can spend more time alive instead of looking at the login screen, wondering why you spent money on this game.  Also, this shit is long.  Sorry, but I can't get it any shorter.
  
  First off.  I want you to understand that hesitating to kill other players is the fastest way to die.  You can't trust anyone.  I don't care if they have goodies for you, they say they watch your stream, they love you, they just want to play with you.  They aren't your friends.  So get the fuck over it and start it off right by putting a bullet in their face and taking their sweet loot.  If you prefer not to do that, just try your best to avoid them.  But if you don't take this advice, don't be surprised when your making a new character and they are laughing maniacally in their global inventory because you're a soft hearted sucker.
  
  Immediate quick tips for improving survivability in this game so you can have some fun.

 * Find a real life friend or long time buddy to play with.  I can't tell you how many times my partner has killed someone while watching my back as I loot stores.
 * Do you need to know where concentrated loot spawns?  [here](http://warz.neon-gaming.de/) Red is high yield, green is low.  Click ""loot points"" to see them.
 * Take your time.  Rushing into a situation regardless of how geared you are almost always gets you killed.  Especially when a friend dies.  HE IS DEAD.  Take your time to avenge him instead of rushing into where he died.  I lost an mp5 today to a pistol doing that.
 * GET SOME FUCKIN BINOCULARS (they also stack).  They are probably one of the best items in the game.  Scope out everything before you walk into it.  Peek every corner with them, be patient.  Sit in a tree clearing for 5 minutes watching over a town you're about to go knock over to see if there is any activity.
 * If you want to travel and get to places, log into a low population server.  People who have the jump on you when you're just trying to cross the country side will kill you 99% of the time.  The same goes for looting towns.  If other players are bothering you, join a 9/40 server and go loot the town.  You might see 1 player instead of 5 with m16's and body armor.
 * If you are looking for ways to PvP, login to a low population server, run to a highly contested town, logout in a safe place and then login to a high population server.  There will almost always be people there you can kill and get their gear.
 * Clear buildings completely before looting.  People like to hide out in corners and kill you while you aren't looking.
 * Try as HARD as you can to stay off sidewalks and grating.  It makes lots of noise and your position will be given away.
 * [Just because you only have a pistol doesn't mean you're fucked](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731442)
 * [Stay out of Whitestone Mountain](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731085).  It kills you instantly for no reason
 * Look at the tops of buildings before you go into town.  People can currently building jump and get on the roof and shoot really easy.
 * ALWAYS HAVE COVER.  Sprint between cover like trees and when you need to rest prone on the ground under the tree.  The longer you're in the open, the more dead you are.
 * Use 3rd person to look around corners and over fences.  You can spy on people and they don't even know you're there.
 * To the previous comment.  They can use 3rd person on you, so if you're in a gun battle and you think ""rushing"" them to get the drop on them because they aren't peeking could give you an advantage.  Don't do it.  He will see you coming and blow your face off.
 * Learn what guns sound like what REAL fast.  Take mental note.  Especially to things that can kill you in 1 shot.
 * Not every gun shows in the backs of players.  Like pistols.  Just because a guy has a starting backpack and his hands are empty, doesn't mean you aren't dead a second later.
 * Try to kill non-priority targets with common ammo if you can do so safely.  If you DO see someone with the small backpack, no helmet, only flashlight etc.  Try to use 9mm ammo on them and not your stanag ammo etc.  It isn't worth it.
 * If you hear a shot, COVER immediately.  Even if it isn't completely near you or at you.  THEN figure out the plan of attack.
 * If you hear a sniper shot or know where one is in the distance I SERIOUSLY suggest switching servers.  You are out gunned completely.  They have you marked dead, you can't juke them, don't try and get cute and jump/sprint away.  Get to cover and log your ass out, or die.
 * The mossberg shotgun can kill someone with m9 helmet and level 2 body armor in 1 shot from medium range.  I've never done it, but I've seen it happen.
 * I suggest your weapons should be on automatic if you can do it, but don't spray and pray.  Make your single clicks without the help of the game so you have full auto when you're surprised and need to lay down serious fire.
 * Anywhere without cover is NOT your friend.
 * If you see someone in the distance it isn't always best to mount up and go attack them, or even fire.  You gain a LOT of survivability by watching their movements, staying invisible and waiting for the perfect time to move between cover or attack. [You also shouldn't always give away your position.  Even if that means passing up on a kill](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731508).  I let that guy live because I had a full backpack otw back to the safe zone where I have to cross a lot of open area.  I didn't take him down not only because he had nothing, but I didn't want to alert everyone in the area with gun shots.  On top of that, look at how exposed he was.  I could of taken him down with ease.  Even if he was fully geared.  You want to minimize the time you're in that situation.  You will pay for it.
 * Don't try to shoot over the back of police cars and other cars while crouched.  It looks like the shot is going to make it, but the bullet hits the car.  Super bad news for a firefight.
 * The front window of the white van models isn't a good place to be.  People can see your head perfectly and it's really easy for them to shoot you through it where you don't have the best peek position.  Try to not start fights with that type of cover.
 * When you reload your clip drops on the ground if it has bullets in it.  Make sure you pick it up if you still want it.
 * When you kill other players via gun fights.  Your #1 priority is to secure the area.  NOT LOOT THE BODY.  Take your time, you need to make sure the people in the area that heard your gunshots aren't in a position to take your loot and the guys loot you just took.  If you have two players, one player loots, the other covers then you switch if needed (full backpack).  NEVER have everyone loot.  You get shot in the back.
 * Experience is currently capped at 10 (at least I've never seen anything higher).  So don't be afraid to delete your character and start over (you will lose your stats though)
 * There is TONS of action at Clearview and Campos.  ALL of the time.  I've been in 10/40 servers and there is 6 of us in Clearview.
 * Until a change happens.  I suggest healing on 4/5/6.  I do bandages/painkillers/antibiotics.  Double tapping one of those keys uses the item.  6 for firefights, 4/5 for zombies, other damage.  1 bandage will cover 1 zombie hit.
 * If you are playing with multiple friends.  Having one be a scout on the city even if he has no sniper is valuable.  Having him scout targets entering a zone could be critical to surviving.  He might miss out on some action, but have a buddy sit on a hill with binoculars giving away positions.  [It is pretty much as close to cheating as you can get without seeing through walls.](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731553)
 * You can access the global inventory by logging out in a safe zone (that one fucking took forever to figure out hahah)
 * If you don't know where your character will spawn I suggest spawning him with nothing and working your way to a safe zone of your choosing then going to global inventory, loading up and going out.
 * Before you head out.  Have a route planned.  [Something like this](http://i.imgur.com/HsUc7.png).  take note of high danger/traffic areas.  Get used to running the SAME route.  You will know the area well, know the cover and have a huge advantage over the others in the area.
 * I would suggest staying the fuck out of Campos.  There are tons of hot loot spots and server hopping going on there.  You will most likely die during your stay there.
 * If you're in town or other potential hot spots.  I suggest not using proxy chat AT ALL.  The guy you're chatting with, might be your friend.  But the other people hiding out, aren't and now they know you're in the area.
 * Stay off the roads, also sometimes players like to meta game and stay on the edge of roads even though they shouldn't be, because they are expecting players to ""not be near roads"" or not looking.  Just make sure you keep your eyes peeled.
 * Turn up your brightness slightly from the games default.  It makes night time easier to see.
 * [Your game model loads before, or almost right before your game actually loads](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1731591).  Always logout in non popular places.
 * I would stray away from the first 30 servers.  I've seen more cheaters in that shit than I would like to admit.
 * Zombies aggro from much further away when you run.  You can use this to your advantage by pulling a zombie in the open to a place of cover to kill it.  You can do this by tapping run in it's aggro range and it will pull the zombie.
 * If you prone next to a tree and run into it, it often makes you stand up, careful when in the woods and you need to stay prone.  
 * Food is much harder to find than water.  It should always take priority.
 * Things like coke and juice give you some food but also give you drink.
 * If you prone AND crouch you will make no sound. (as in, together. Not doing one or the other)
 * You can loot items through walls.
 * Your team should stick together, but not too close.  Have fast accurate communication and make sure you stay LOS with everyone at all times and communicate when you have ""lost"" sight of a player.  [It's important](http://www.twitch.tv/tieryal/c/1732535).
 * If you go to cities often, learn the names of the buildings.  Post office, corner store, etc.  Have names for them so you can quickly acquire targets.

1350675243.0	11rhmd	100% Randomized Loot Spawns/Tables - A Better Future For The WarZ (Please Sign!)	coreywaslegend	154	42	66	"There have been plenty of discussion/idea/complaint threads about this hot topic over the last week. I've decided to throw this up here (hopefully) as a shining beacon of hope that Sergey and the crew will take this matter to heart and give the game and community what it deserves! Yes I completely understand that in alpha not every system they have developed is in place yet - and they may be working on doing just this! But it never hurts to ""hammer the point home""...

The Warz desperately needs 100% randomized loot spawn/tables per server. Right now we have static loot spawns which promotes:


- Server Hopping
- Constant camping/killing for a single item
- Oversaturation of guns per player
- Reduces need to explore the map


What we need is a code in place that can spawn any item at any of the loot spawns in the game at random intervals. Yes this is a lot more coding work in the back end for the development team, but in the long run the time invested to create such a system will pay for itself 10 fold within the community.

Here is a small example of the ridiculousness of static spawned loot: http://i.imgur.com/kr190.png 
This was done over a 1 hour period across multiple servers. The Rifle spawns in the same spot every hour. Completely unacceptable.

Please get this thread noticed by the dev team people! This alone will make the game jump leaps and bounds in terms of replayability and fun factor. Thanks for your time."	t5_2ujwe	True

*I added bookmarks via ##ANNOYING HEADERS so that you can easily digest this portion of Chinese history.*

&gt;**##Original content**

WarZ at this point isnt much more than a playable proof of concept, no matter what Sergey tries to sell you. I have hope that this idea will eventually turn into a game. I think we would be further along that road if Sergey and crew started a Kickstarter rather than this underhanded user funded tech demo, but I understand his reasoning. Who's going to take a limb out on a developer with almost zero credibility history on an idea thats is already being done? So Sergey and crew probably sat down and said hey you know what, lets just pretend our game is further along than it is, and release an ""alpha"" that people can get in if they pay.
Sure, it isn't exactly the most genuine tactic, but I heard the developers aren't all that well off, I mean, just visit their website (Arktos). Hammerpoint doesn't even really exist. The way they are doing things people will either hopefully see the allure of the foundations of what they have thus far and invest further in it (hence now GC is available for purchase, to wit they added 95GC Red Dot Scopes which are pretty awesome), or unfortunately their wording and, well, the public's naivety will lead to bad press along the way.


I was a pretty active member of the community, but there was just wave after wave of people coming in with unrealistic (although in their words it was better described as mislead, and I cant argue with that) perception of what is at hand. With enough trolling by said people (the game does seem to invite a very young audience) I eventually got banned from the forums temporarily, for defending their own game.
That's when I realized, there is no point in fighting this vocal minority. The game is a cult phenomenon, which I dare say is similar to DayZ's community. I'm an avid PC gamer and I never actually bothered to try DayZ despite seeing various videos online about it. ArmaII? Ew.
However I eventually did play DayZ and I did enjoy it quite a bit, but something about it didnt engage me enough to start it up more than a few times.


WarZ however (and this is entirely subjective) keeps me engaged, mostly due to the pvp mechanics in the game being more fluid or akin to a CoD game. I like the way the ballistics feel, the gun sounds are good, even if the gun models and animations need work. I like the attachment system. None of these things were original, however. The attachment system is a blatant copy of Crysis.
But once you get over the fact that these are good ideas, and their progression into other games is only natural (hard to find a shooter that doesnt have iron sight aiming these days, in fact I can hardly live without the concept), it's easy to see where WarZ could possibly succeed.


And for that, they keep my patronage, at least for now. We'll see if the DayZ standalone can somehow blot it out, but the future is uncertain.


And for the record, you are in fact the vocal minority. No matter how many people are going to jump on this bandwagon and talk about how the game is obviously dying because x and y group of people stopped playing: it simply isnt accurate. Just yesterday I logged on and I was astounded that every last US server had more than 20-25 people on. I was happy to see the game busy, but at the same time I prefer to get on lower population servers due to aforementioned issues with hackers etc. And to end on a more uplifting note, I imagine once the game hits Steam, the statistics will be more visible, and more people will start playing. Hopefully by then they get their shit together and address the hacking situation so that they can take their steam presence in full momentum.

I wish I could be more brief, my commentary is always TL;DR. I dont know how to condense my thoughts into an easy to digest bullet list. I will attempt one, however:

&gt;**##TL;DR TL;DR TL;DR** 

TL;DR The game is in early development. Yes they have been preaching otherwise, yes it is a bit underhanded, but it was probably the only shot they had at getting the funding they needed. The developers took a gamble, but now they need to catch up to their future-casting of the truth. It will take your support, however: and what is available thus far is very captivating.

    
    
    

&gt;**##Advice about enjoying the game as is.**

*My best advise, if you want to enjoy the game, is to hop on low pop servers. I dont get on a server that has more than 15 people. And for the love of god, stay away from Clearview, Campos, and Norad. There are other places you can visit, and there is plenty of loot there because the hackers/espers arent bothering to loot them. You'll also find other non-hackers like yourself if you wish to pvp, or perhaps group up. Yes, I still get killed by hackers, but its rare. If you want to engage in the action in Clearview, expect hackers at some point. If you do get in a fight, loot the most important things, find a safe place, and log out. Go save some of that stuff. Dont walk around with everything. Hackers or not, you will die. An unfortunate trek through a field that is being surveyed by a sniper and you're done.* 


**Consider these factors as you play, especially if you play alone. If you want to survive solo, play like a leper, because its survival of the fittest, and there is strength in numbers: therefore you are easily identified as the weak.**

Trust no one, avoid people, dont chase the pvp, let it come to you if it -must-, and know when to cut your loses and run. And frankly, if you come across another loner, take him out and take his things. You will have mixed feelings about this. Welcome to life after the apocalypse.
If you have a group with good communication via teamspeak etc, play tactically. Some of you might still die, but at least with group effort you can recover your loot.

&gt;**##Comments that you should read.**

**I'm fucking tired of answering [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7cfzil).**

 I'm linking to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7blj5x) just in case it gets lost beneath other comments because it's also something I am very keen about.

[This conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWarZ/comments/14bj55/the_truth_about_war_z_and_how_to_cope_with_it/c7bloi6) is rather good at getting to the heart of the issue, even if I may be wrong in thinking he has misunderstood me, hopefully with my explanations I have made myself clear, and the points raised are pretty good, on both sides.

&gt;**##Unnecessary and unrelated rant about DayZ.**

*Update: I really shouldn't add this commentary, but what the hell: WarZ servers were having some issues earlier today, so to get my zombie fix I hopped on DayZ. Now I make no comparison, the two games exist as separate entities to me due to their significant differences in execution, but ugh. Walking around feels like Trespasser. I'm stuck in a door frame because of my pistol, and I cant lower my pistol the way I can a rifle. The melee weapon needs to be reloaded? Also the way zombies run at you it makes using the hatched rather hit and miss. The range for zombies to do damage and your melee range are both rather far. What good is the trembling if it doesnt affect your aim in 3rd person? And why do zombies go through walls? Why cant I barricade myself inside a building? I have to stop running in order to hop over a 3foot fence that zombies can just run through? I tried to make a camp fire on top of a building and it bloody disappeared. I figured it couldnt spawn on the buildings and was probably on the first floor but I couldnt find it. And for the love of god, why do I go from 60 fps when in a field to half that if I stare into a bush?*

Anyway, I still really enjoy a lot of aspects of DayZ, but there is plenty there that is glitchy, unoptimized, and clumsy. I'm just putting that out there since so many people are so quick to mention the same things in WarZ.

I was actually left kind of disappointed, I feel as though neither game is getting it quite right. I like the WarZ engine, its ""feel"" is there, but they need those damn features and anti hack. I dont have faith in the Arma engine, but the DayZ designers do seem to know what they're doing. I have high hopes for the standalone. As is its like voting Democrat or Republican, the lesser of two evils. =/

&gt;**##Unnecessary but somewhat related rant about WarZ.**

*Rant rant rant:* And while I'm on my soapbox, I'd also like to add one more suggestion I think is vital: **Player models should not load any further than your computer can load terrain details such as grass, so that everyone has fair game when it comes to camo.** I play on low, so this affects me as much as anyone else, but I hate the fact that from far away, other players stick out like a sore thumb. It seems the further you are from someone the more of an advantage you have over them, in terms of spotting. And that's a big advantage in this game. If I cant render grass on that hill, I shouldnt be able to render player models either. This concerns me constantly as I prone in a field while typing or changing equipment or even if I'm being dastardly and want to surprise a group coming in my direction. Knowing that from far, they just see some dumb ass sitting atop a flat plane, and from my perspective my view is obscured by grass infuriates me. This also affects trees. I hear gunfire at Clearview so I hide behind/next to a tree under the foliage to watch whats happening, then it occurs to me that from Clearview, I'm just some dumbass just standing there next to a big tree trunk, because the foliage details at the bottom are not rendered from distances, but I am.**End rant.** 

There, that should make up for the DayZ bashing I did a few minutes ago.

&gt;**##TL;DR TL;DR TL;DR** 

TL;DR The game is in early development. Yes they have been preaching otherwise, yes it is a bit underhanded, but it was probably the only shot they had at getting the funding they needed. The developers took a gamble, but now they need to catch up to their future-casting of the truth. It will take your support, however: and what is available thus far is very captivating. &gt; However, if this is all you've gathered from this post, then you are severely misinformed, and should probably read at least some of the rest of it before commenting.

1355958068.0	154v1y	Is 'The War Z' quickly becoming the most hated game of all time? (X-post from r/gaming)	kylekylekylekyle	122	37	90	"Since its release on Steam, the creators of ""The War Z"" have made innumerable mistakes to ultimately piss off their players and scare away those who originally thought the game might be cool. It started by lying about features that the game actually didn't have, then lying about the map size, then creating game art that was blatantly stolen from zombie films, walks, games etc, then refusing to give refunds to the customers they drove off, then making a shitty, half ass apology saying ""We also want to extend our apologies to all players who misread information about game features."" However, the insult to injury was the full screen message on the subreddit 'r/thewarz' telling angry players to donate their refunded cash to charity. With all this hostility towards Hammerpoint Interactive, the question is becoming ""Is The War Z becoming one of the most hated games""? What do you think reddit?

1353202865.0	13dn7s	Customer Servive - A reason not to buy TheWarZ?!	EpicFloo	108	39	44	"Being a huge fan of DayZ and the zombie-genre in general I was very hyped up by the release of WarZ. Optimistic as I am, I approached WarZ with high hopes and they were fulfilled. The game was great, major bugs where fixed quickly and even feedback from the community was heard and changes were made. However I quickly came to notice that people were quickly starting to get disappointed by the customer service (Posts being deleted, Mods being unfriendly, Lack of English skills, etc). Since I had never experienced any issue I really didn’t care too much.


This, however, changed soon. Yesterday morning I checked the forums as usual and realized many people where complaining about accounts being frozen. Not suspecting anything I tried to log in and saw that I had a 24h ban myself. I went back into the forums and “joined” an existing thread about this issue. Not having hack/cheated/duped etc. I discussed what the reason for the ban could be. Quickly we came to realization that it could have been the Alt+F4’ing in the “Disconnecting Soon” screen and the issue with “Active session already running” when logging back in. Assuming Alt+F4’ing people might be logged as people trying to dupe stuff I asked in the forums if this could be the reason for the ban. 


After posting back and forth a Mod decided to join the conversation by deleting all posts and pointing out to this quote:

Read the quote [/Quote]


Few minutes later the topic was closed without further notice. After looking up on Reddit and on other forums, this apparently happens all the time. 


I decided to write up a post pointing out how badly they treated customers who invested up to 50$ for their game and that they should inform their players when and why they are banned. My post didn’t survive more than 30 minutes without being deleted in silence without any response of a Mod. 

http://pastebin.com/7SgqByEH


I don’t know if this has only happened to me but I am really unhappy at the moment and somehow feel ripped off somehow. Mainly because of the unprofessional support and the way the mods behave/treat their community. Would I have known that the player support is this bad, I might have reconsidered buying the game and I hope this helps some of you guys decide on whether to buy the game or not.


Thank you for your attention.

Original Post is Below:


**There have been several posts lately asking for help with purchase/no purchase decisions, and they deserve a relatively un-biased response.**

So instead of writing some long review of my personal experiences with the game, i'm just going to streamline the info into bullet points. 
Just for reference, I don't hate OR love the game, nor the dev team. 
Personally, i'm sick to death of the blind fanboys as well as the blind haters, and have made that clear in other posts and comments in this subreddit.  
I've also avoided hearsay and conjecture, as well as direct comparisons between DayZ and WarZ, except where it is germane to the discussion.

p.s. This info is largely subject to change, so if interested, please follow the updates through Hammerpoint's official channels, your favorite gaming related sites or in this subreddit.

**TL;DR** This is probably about as un-biased an accounting as you're gonna get anywhere.



**PROS:**

* DayZ style gameplay

* Relatively few bugs

* Pretty good server uptime

* Easy to install retail client

* No queues or wait times

* Customizable weapon attachment system(a near direct copy of the  Crysis attachment system)

* Clan system with in-game visual indicators for clanmates(this is a huge benefit in squad play)

* Multiple character models with selectable face and clothing styles


* The hacks in WarZ are less severe than in DayZ. WarZ hacks seem to be limited to aimbots, speed hacks, ESP, no-spread, and no-clipping. There are apparently no thunderdomes, teleporting(anymore), nukes, godmode, item spawns, building spawns etc. 

* Private game server rentals are planned with both PVP and PVE settings available.

* Private ""stronghold"" server rentals are planned. These are similar to instanced player housing in MMOs, but you get an approx. 3 square mile outdoor map with limited resource collection and structure building blocks.

* Many planned upcoming features and content incl. skill trees, vehicles, expanded medical system, crafting etc.

**CONS:**

* ""Hackers"" while less disruptive, seem to be more prevalent in WarZ than they were in DayZ.

* Gameplay is currently limited to 1. Item scavenging 2. open world PVP 3. Open world PVE(zombie killing)

* Target dates for content and feature delivery have been repeatedly pushed back.

* Certain planned and discussed features incl. Bounty System have disappeared from the planned feature updates with no comment from the devs despite questions from the community

* Relatively ineffectual anti-hack systems. 

* Clan invites over the initial 20 actually cost real life money.(the devs mentioned a plan to allow people to earn cash shop currency in-game, but no details have been given to date)

* Clan invites are not account wide, but you must invite each character separately(every account has 5 character slots)

* Only one map to play on. No new map planned for approx. 6mo. (current map is at most(see edits) 1/5 the size of the DayZ map Chernarus)

* The devs have stated that whitelists are not planned for private servers. Since the WarZ anti-hack measures are spotty at best, whitelist will most likely be a necessary tool for maintaining reasonable private server populations.

**AMBIGUOUS:**

* Permanent item storage

* Less focus on survival as a meta game

* No hunting of animals/cooking system

* Zombie AI is easily circumvented by players of moderate skill level

* PVP focus - All public servers are PVP flagged

* Limited fresh spawn protections, spawn points are all over the map, some even adjacent to highly contested chokepoints. This results in a high number of fresh spawn PVP killings.

* The rarest and most desirable items are so rare as to be essentially non-existent. Don't think of item rarity as a bell curve, think of it as a right angle.

* Lack of a meaningful alignment system. (Devs have indicated in the past that this would be improved, but have given no concrete details or timeline)

* Lack of a mathematically realistic mildot system, limited ballistics realism.

* Limited Pay 2 Win - ammo, scopes and other attachments and gameplay enhancing items are available for real money in the Marketplace.


Edits(I have stopped all editing of this document see Disclaimer above)

* Removed ""player made quests"" from vanished features list due to this overlooked info: ""January-February 2013 - ...Player defined missions !"" Source: http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?67660-Wipe-new-packages-new-features-roadmap-new-antihack-Steam-version-!

1350567292.0	11os0r	WarZ from a DayZ clan that dosnt dislike either title	StarSyth	115	52	42	"Greetings all, I am StarSyth.

I run around with a small group of gamers in various games spanning multiple genre with one key aspect in mind, CO-OP gameplay with my fellow community members.

I led the charge into WarZ for one simple reason, I'm tired of blindly supporting the 1st game out just because it was first, especially when that title has done little to keep my loyalty.

**Comparison between WarZ and DayZ**

before I continue I will state that as a community we will be playing both titles, below I hope to adress the reasons why. Before people start claiming you cant compair the games, your wrong. Both games are developed on the exact same concept and its only their method of execution which seperates them.

**Map**

The direction each game has taken is most diffrent here. Day Z has a much larger more open and accesible map, each cliff and mountain is explorable which leads to less encounters while traveling with main engagements focused around strategic/resouce choke points such as military spawns.

The WarZ's map is more themepark than open, designed to give the illusion of size rather than actually being large. This allows it to make a relativly small city feel much bigger. This style of map design creates chokepoints in the terrain itself, with no or few alternative routes to areas and dead ends to places of intrest such as the tunnel loot spawns etc.

Each map style puts people into choke points, the main diffrence being that in DayZ your travel is less predictable and restrict.

**Movement**

first thing you may notice if you played DayZ is that movement in WarZ is slower but also you move virtually silently (unless in buildings). this enables people to sneak up on others much more effectivly than in DayZ. Controlled are simpler in WarZ which has its ups and downs, I dont actually see a point to prone in WarZ at all presently where its a vital gameplay mechanic in DayZ.

**Loot**

WarZ annoyed me at first with this, until I learned about the global inventory. Some are saying its game breaking, I disagree. Finding items in WarZ is actually more of an aim for my group now because we have somewhere to store it.

At first you will be storing every hammer you find and every booney hat, till the point where you have 10 hammers in your global inventory and start to think ""to hell with it"" and start spawning with hammers and booney hats. Eventually you get to the stage where your spawning with a pistol, rifle, mask, backpack and ammo.

Its at this point people will be saying ""if you can just spawn fully geared what the hell is the point?"" and my reply is maintaining that pool of loot is the source of enjoyment for me in WarZ. I have a mad 20-30 mins of killing sprees sniping people and taking control of an area or location then when I've died a few times I re-gear for maximum loot whoring (larger backpack, meds, water and a hammer/bat) and head into the city or north for a loot run or two.

In DayZ, getting a full set of items is the first major goal. Once you have done so a number of times you tend not to really care too much. I like to respawn in dayz and fight in the towns and cities of the south before heading north again. I feel both games offer me fun in very diffrent ways.

**Combat**

PvP is fun in both games, you will get more kills in WarZ than in DayZ due to population density and map design. DayZ still has more meaning to a kill but your going to have to work harder and longer to achive it. So its a balance. Death also means more in DayZ than in WarZ.

We have all agreed (the guys I play with) that DayZ squad action is more intensive with its spotting, sniping, rangefinding, tracking and massive travel times and feels more ""pro gaming"" than WarZ.

Having said that we also really like pvp in WarZ, having dead players able to type means we can harvest many more tears, the fragility of the human body meaning you can even trust people being NEAR you for fear of the mighty flashlight or hammer time. It can be in many ways alot more fun for your time.

**Input/Output**

As hit on above, I belive that if time you invest is limited then you will get more return playing WarZ than DayZ. We can play DayZ all day without dying or having any combat that is note worthy. In WarZ even fully geared your not going to be alive long. Its gameplay progresses much faster but with the lack of true death and global inventory systems it also dosnt really mean as much.

**So Why will you play both?**

We have this idea, after a long session on DayZ or when we dont have time for one it will be nice to switch over to our own private server for WarZ and fortify a building or two in the city and/or go have some pvp fun on public servers. We have found that one energizes us to play the other so in the end both titles win xD

As usual my first 2 characters to zombies because i didn't have anything to defend myself with. Then i found the hammer, lets call him.....Smashy.....yeah....Smashy. Well after i found Smashy i was having a blast, caving in zombie skulls and finding phat lewts like granola bars and water bottles. Then i entered a small town with a church, a grocery, 4 houses, and a post office. As i moved into the post office i heard shots, so i ducked in behind the counter and waited. The guy with the gun said something along the lines of ""hey i saw you, friendly?"" to which i replied yes. Happy to meet someone who, as of this moment, wasn't going to shoot me in the face i stowed Smashy in my belt, greeting my new friend with some pain killers. He then shot me 3 times in the foot. Needless to say i was distraught and rightfully so. But instead of dying i immediately downed 2 bottles of pain killers and went to work with Smashy. After 5 fast paced seconds of the most intense ""ring around the rosy"" game i have ever played the bandit was dead on the ground and glorious loot exploded out of his lifeless body. After the initial ""wow you hacker I'm reporting you"" and ""my crew is going to own you when they find you"" i finished looted all of his guns and sat in wait of his ""crew"". After 10 minutes they finally arrived, with the bandit i had killed in tow. They kept their guard up until they entered the post office, where i had tactfully put some guns and ammo as bait. Thinking i had only taken some and left, they began looting. This is where Smashy came into play. I shot the two new bandits in the face then let Smashy take care of the first guy a second time. Again the post office was full of loot. To much for me to carry, actually. So instead of just leaving it for them to return to, i took what i could and emptied the rest into the floor. After having a quick discussion with Smashy about where to head next, we made our way to the nearest safe zone to store our loot.

"	ColJohn	93	37	128	"Just got this email from the Hammerpoint Dev's - VERY Interesting.

Dear fellow Survivors,

 

It has now been more than two months since we launched public access to The War Z. We’ve definitely had our ups and downs, and I thought that this Holiday break was the right time for me to try to step back a little and think about our journey since it started. This may be a little long, but I would appreciate if you could stay with me for a few minutes as I try to go over the highlights of the game as well as some of the hurdles and controversies, how we have addressed that and what our plans are.

 

First of all a very big and sincere “Thank You!” to all of you. We are really proud of the community we have formed with you guys. Every day we have hundreds of thousands of players on our servers, and this is a life-changing event for the team and me. We are blessed to have you as members of the community and we are well aware that without you the game would be nothing.  Along with that thanks, though, I need to admit that we failed to effectively communicate some of our plans and actions to both our existing players and to our new prospective players. This failure to communicate resulted in some very negative feedback from some members of our community, but while it might be easy to label them as “haters” or some other dismissive term, in all honesty this is my fault.  I became arrogant and blinded by the early success and quick growth of The War Z, our increasing number of players, numbers we were getting from surveys, etc., and I chose not to notice the concerns and questions raised by these members of the game community as well as others.  This failure is entirely on my shoulders and if anything I owe thanks to that vocal minority and admit that I should have paid attention sooner. I chose instead to concentrate on the bigger picture – my dream of turning The War Z from being a game developed by a small indie team into a large online venture, instead of addressing small things first and staying focused on the game issues. At the end my arrogance led us to the moment, when all those small things finally caught up and created a “perfect storm” that affected all of our community members.  For that I’m truly sorry and apologize to all of our community as well as the larger PC gaming community that is not yet playing The War Z. 

 

I do not take this situation lightly, and last week events were especially humbling for me. I’ve experienced a range of emotions, most of which centered on regret for not having addressed some of the issues differently than we did, but we can’t change the past. The only thing we can do is to be sure that we won’t repeat the same mistakes in the future. I have realized that as the leader of this ship, I missed all early warnings that were saying, “Your community is not as happy as you think they are, you need to alter course.” I was too focused on how great we are and how a small independent team got their first game to over 700,000 users in a two-month period.  Though that is something to be very proud of, allowing that to overshadow the existing community and their satisfaction was poor judgment.  

 

I want to give you some insight into what our plans are for the future, but before we get to that, I’d like to clear the air with you on several important topics.

 

**Community management and moderation – the problem**

Even since the early Alpha launch, this game has always cultivated a large and loyal player base that is very active in the game. Again, thank you for this. Unfortunately, we weren’t prepared for this large success and the way we managed the community was not the way it should’ve been. We relied too much on forum moderators, whose primary role was to punish those who break rules, not to engage the community and guide conversations into productive discussions about problems. There wasn’t enough presence of the development team on forums, there wasn’t enough updates on development of UPCOMING features. We failed to communicate our position and messaging on the outside platforms such as Facebook, twitter and various online websites, and when we did this we chose to rely more on arrogance rather than being humble and trying to understand why people were saying negative things. We chose to tune out negative reactions to the game, not paying enough attention to them – and this, again, is my fault. We chose to rely too much on numbers – percentage of refund requests, number and dynamic of our daily and monthly active users, etc. Well, in hindsight – those things probably work well for more casual games, but the hardcore PC gaming community is much different and can be very vocal about what they feel. Even when the percentage of players with negative comments is small, as the community grows, even a small percentage can add up to be a very significant absolute number. And it’s not just a number – those are real people with real issues they are having with the game. OP Productions (publisher for War Z) and me personally have failed to address those issues effectively.

 

**Community management and moderation – the solution!**

We’re changing our community management procedures and rules right now. We’re going to reevaluate publishing and marketing team performance, and I will make sure that Hammerpoint Interactive developers will have a much stronger voice when it comes to community management and we won’t rely 100% on OP Productions to single handedly handle this. Lots of changes will be happening very fast in the weeks to come. One of the ideas that I proposed was to select 10 players from around the world who can represent the player community and invite them to our offices in Los Angeles, to meet the team, check out what we’re doing, and share with actual developers their concerns, wishes and thoughts on the game. We also will involve community, to a much higher degree, in the process of making our next map for the War Z (called “California”). We’ll be discussing many of the aspects of the map with you and asking for feedback.

 

We’re revisiting our forum policies; we’re going to bring on an additional community management team, additional moderators and we’ll train them how to respond to things properly. There will still be restrictions on harassment, trash talk, etc. But we’ll make sure that every opinion is heard. At the same time, I must also be cautious: we cannot address all issues and there cannot be only one voice. Please accept that. With hundreds of thousands of players playing, talking, chatting, voicing their strong opinions, there will always be diverging opinions. And some issues that are minor ones are sometimes brought to light by very vocal channels. I would even say there is sometimes a beginning of controversy because the game is now so popular. So there is sometimes a distortion between the severity of the issue and the attention it gets. But we will clearly implement steps to better listen to the community.  

 

 

**What is Foundation Release?**

The most asked question of the last week was “is this the final release?”  My answer has always been that for an online game a “final” release means that the game is dead – so there’s really no such thing, you never stop developing, making changes to and adding new features to the game. This is how we came to call the current version of The War Z “Foundation Release.”  We launched the Foundation Release on December 17, 2012 as our first-stage release that we use as a foundation to build upon. It does include the core features and a fully playable environment. This is our version 1.0, and of course  we will continue to improve that version as time goes on.  Did we rush to get it done? That is a tough question, but to answer honestly I think that we all pushed very hard to be first to market and in time for the holidays. Our entire team was working late, long hours to iron out issues and include as many features as possible.  This is part of the reality of being a smaller, independent game developer. If we had a larger team and more funding we may have done things differently, but I’m not sure. I don’t think it was a mistake because our numbers have been strong since day one and, even with the recent negativity, our metrics are really solid and we’ve been continuing to grow.  The negative opinions are always the most vocal, but most players are really enjoying the game and we’ve been attracting more and more daily active players every week.  A lot of the gaming journalists that have been playing the game have also given us some great feedback. I realize that we will take a few hits from some of the traditional gaming press in terms of review scores, but I’m hoping that even they will consider that this game is a living project that will continue to evolve as time goes on. We are very proud of our Foundation Release, and we do stand behind it like we have stood behind any previous version.

 

**What’s on the Horizon?**

As for what will happen next with The War Z? We’re currently evaluating the relationship between Hammerpoint and OP Productions.  I firmly believe that Hammerpoint should be playing a more prominent role in publishing/game operating process. We’re in a process of adding new key members to our team, bringing on guys who have much more experience operating and growing successful online games and I know this is going to make a huge difference in terms of development.  We’ll be making some big decisions in terms of leadership for both companies and I will personally change how I handle many things.  Above all we will continue to develop and make this game the best that it can be.  

 

I know that to some people my words won’t matter much. I understand that. I hope that will change as we move forward and deliver the features that our players have been waiting for. I can promise you that from now on things will be much more transparent, and we’ll provide better communication and engage our community to discuss upcoming features way before they appear in the game. 

 

I do believe that we aren’t even close to uncovering the true potential for The War Z, and I hope that in the coming year, we’ll be able to regain trust from people who were alienated by our actions and we’ll be able to move forward and grow the game together.

 

Thank you for reading all this, thank you for supporting the game and thank you for helping us to change and realize what’s important as well as what is not.

 

I hope you are all having a happy holiday and I wish you the best for the New Year!

 

Sincerely,

 

Sergey Titov

Executive Producer, The War Z



**TL:DR - We know we've been less than stellar in the past at listening to growing community concerns but we're bringing on some experienced personnel to help us grow the game. Above all trust us to do better at listening to your concerns in the future.**

Whoppah	118	68	124	"I'm going to start off to say, that I bought this game, the day after it first released, and let me tell you, there was no end to me and War Z. Prior to playing the shit out of War Z, I've heard about Day Z, but haven't once touched it, or hardly even seen anything about it. I was completely new to the Zombie survival game; barely sinking my teeth into this small, yet vastly expanding genre, I was hooked.

From the start, the way War Z was advertised, it made me even more interested. The picture of the [vehicles](http://thewarz.com/pic/War-Z_S01.jpg), and the [epic looking scenes](http://thewarz.com/pic/War-Z_S04.jpg). When I first played, I was filled with so much excitement that, even after 10-15 hours of gameplay, I still looked passed the fact that, I still hadn't seen anything CLOSE to what the site and pictures painted the War Z to be. Digging past all the bugs/hacks/glitching I've been through, I told myself it would get better. I've had my fun with War Z, but I'm running up against a brick wall. 

This game, is dying. Tell me I'm over exaggerating, tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm just some mad kid, but this has creditable insight on whats going on in War Z. The duping is back, it's estimated over **[15 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Y2WHtvK6rso#t=656s)** USD worth of items has been injected into the games economy through duping, and tens of thousands of rare weapons injected into the game as well.

For months *still* I sit here, and hope that one day I'll see that magic patch, that'll add what I've hopped to see in this game since day zero. Truth is, its probably never going to happen. This game has SO much potential, but every chance Sergey has at turning this game around, he digs its grave even deeper. Its estimated that he has made over 10 million dollars from this game... If you were to tell people this was a 10 million dollar game, they would stare at you like you were a complete idiot. I've given this game so much of my trust, I've told my closest friends that this game is amazing, and its worth their money. I now completely regret saying anything to my friends about WarZ, in fact, I'm a bit ashamed. I was the person who stood up for this game. I was the person who said ""They're making mistakes I know, we just have to be patient and trust they'll pull through."" I stood by this game, in the darkest of days.

I want to make myself clear, I am not saying this game is worse, or better than Day Z. It's just a simple fact, that I myself have picked up Day Z, and find that game much more suited to how **I** would like a game like these two, to be. 

With all that being said, I feel like I've been cheated... robbed blind. This game has tricked me into making me feel like it was a complete game, only to slowly realize, that wasn't that case at all. I really wish the best for War Z, but I'm not keeping my hopes up. As for me, I'm done with this game, and everything revolving around it.

I wish the best of luck to everyone.

TL&amp;DR: TheWarZ is Dead(for me), Sergey is rich, and the poor run blind.

Progress Report, 11/13
Good news, everyone!

In the spirit of continued communication, I wanted to update everyone on whats going on over here at Hammerpoint Interactive.

Clans are kickin' in the pipeline now, and moving along at a pretty good clip. We're planning on a sizable patch for Thanksgiving, including a rather large content update (official announcement later this week).

Also, some other tidbits I figured you'd be pleased to note:

We're more than aware of the server debate. While I can't say specifically what we're deciding to do in terms of private vs. public servers, we won't be locking players to private servers with separate Global Inventories. Additionally, the idea we're moving with now is that for testing purposes there is no change in loot from private to public, just so we can see the ramifications. If we do reduce loot at the start it would just be reducing military spawns, which ultimately won't matter as we're adding
More civilian weapons! .22 caliber rifles, etc - I brought this up in our meeting today and Sergey gave us the thumbs up, and art is already discussing the best to include.
Also, brace yourselves, TPS crosshairs are coming...
as are fists for melee....
and a fix for the duping item issue!

All in all we're looking at some very positive changes in the near future.

Other items I brought up for discussion: Regular vs. Hardcore mode. The plan right now is that Hardcore means your character dies forever - you can hang on to him/her for trophy purposes/leaderboards, but otherwise once dead is always dead.

Also, the foul language filter for chat option is coming, along with the name filter.

Oh, and we're also discussing a proper trade system to help stimulate the economy. As soon as I've got some more info there I'll pass it along!

So, stay tuned for an announcement this week regarding next weeks patch, and I'll see you in game!

EDIT: I forgot to mention another female character was just completed and added in, so she'll go out with the next patch.

Also, for those of you flaming us for lying, all we're doing here is being as transparent as is reasonable with the game. Its a balance between getting peoples hopes up vs. not giving them anything to hope for. When I say 'clans are coming on X day' that's because its the current plan. When things change, or the task becomes suddenly more difficult than we'd previously estimated, deadlines get moved. It happens in every major developer - I'm simply striving to shed some light on our process, rather than remain silent."	t5_2ujwe	True
1352669916.0	130zxc	"I'm done for now, I'll be back for the final release. But here are my top five ""Stuff that need fixin'!"""	Mad-Dee	71	23	47	"1: Healing items; bandages = Medium Medkit. Painkillers = Small medkit. Antibiotics = Large Medkit. Whenever you watch someone streaming and some crack shot hits them with an assault rifle from 100 yards, all they have to do is his 5 on their keyboard and bam, instant health. No animation, barely any cooldown. Makes combat feel like Skyrim where you can drink a dozen potions in a split second.

2: Boulder city; the only place where I starved to death searching for loot. Wound up camping just murdering people coming for the crash site (And the wonderful hats that spawn there.) Just to try and get some lousy granola bars.

3: Money; Currently, cash spawns on zombies in cities, but if you experiment and observe you'll quickly notice the cash spawns are not randomised, there will always be cash or no cash depending on where the zombie spawns, meaning that, during my stay in boulder city, I quickly figured out the best places to kill zombies, leading to LODSEMONE,

4: Loot spawn system; Currently loot will spawn when you're close to a spawn area, this has led to many people camping in supermarkets, hiding atop shelves afk, items spawning around them. Whilst this has led to me getting some easy kills and loot besides, a survival game where food materializes around you is kinda lame,

5: Banditry; Right now there's absolutely no, zero penalty for being a bandit. No change in gameplay whatsoever. This has led to the game devolving into Deathmatch: Colorado. This is fine, but I'm starting to wonder why I don't actually play ANY other first person shooter, because I'm not playing WarZ for the shooting mechanics."	t5_2ujwe	True

1364931434.0	1bja8x	Current State of War Z	wolfnwolf	61	16	52	"Firstly, let me say that I make this post based on my experience with developing games, and my current knowledge of War Z.  I am an independent game developer, and though the games I've released have not been majorly successful, I do understand the game development pipeline fairly well.  I've worked with several teams, programmers, and 3D graphics designers.

I want to start off by offering my answer to a question many of us are asking.  Will the game be improved/updated?  This is a though question to answer, because there are two conflicting sides.  On one side, Hammerpoint made more then enough money at the release of the game to develop a vast amount of new content and features.  On the other side, the company has proven itself to be very unorganized, unprofessional, and inefficient.  In the past, I've talked with many 3D Freelance Artists who all created fantastic 3D Environments, Props, and Characters.  This included budgeting, and actually hiring some of them to do work.  I can say with confidence, that a map similar to the current War Z map could be created for less than $10,000.  In fact, I created a similar one myself with almost no budget.  This would include audio, effects, props, everything.  If you disagree, that's fine, it may very well cost more then I think - but the point is that Hammerpoint has made far more then enough money not only improve and update the current map, but create more maps.  There is literally no reason why all buildings should not be fully enter-able with each floor accessible.   Currently, architecturally the majority of the buildings do not even make sense.  This is an example of poor Game Design and Level Design.  In 3D Design, you make the main floor, the floor above that, and then copy it as many floors as you want.  This may be repetitive, but at least each floor would be open and you could make each floor unique with a couple subtle changes. Here is an example from a building I made in Unity: http://i.imgur.com/fOdDiHU.png

With that, I've barely just scratched the surface.  The main point is that HP has made enough money to have drastically improved the game by now, and they haven't.  This is due to two reasons.  1) They are not investing the money back into the game.  2) They are wasting money, and do not properly know how to move forward with the games development.  In my opinion, if they can't get their shit together soon and use that money wisely and release a massive update with a new map, content, and features, they should hand the game over to another company.  Sell it to a company who can do something with it.  Right now I would place the odds at 50/50.  There is a chance they'll move forward, release the California map, Cars, new features and content.  But only if they invest their money wisely into development - remember - we should of seen this by now - at least some of it.  To date, they have mainly done bug fixes, made minor changes and updates to existing content.  I also say there is a 50 percent chance that they will just continue this way, and continue to disappoint all of us.  But seriously, Hammerpoint, if you don't have a big release planned soon - SELL WarZ to someone who will do something worthwhile with it.  

I'm not bashing War Z, I'm expressing needed concern towards the company that is making it.  I, and many others do enjoy the game and see it's potential.  I know for a fact that bigger and better updates and improvements could be made to War Z if our money was being spent more wisely.  Minor updates that are almost insignificant to players is not what should be happening.  With the months that have passed since we all bought the game, we should have already seen big map improvements (not just more origin crates and vines).  We should have seen cars, and new features.  I mean think about adding vehicles - you add a couple models and a driving control system.  It's extremely simple.  With that kind of money, anything should be simple.  But with Hammerpoint, at least to date it's anything but simple - and I don't get it.  

So Hammerpoint, please, just do it.  Unlock the games potential, by spending our money wisely, and release REAL UPDATES, FEATURES, CONTENT.  Get a new anti-hack system that actually works.  We want to play your game without the headaches, we want to see the game succeed and grow as it should have.  We don't want to wait around for very minor, uninteresting updates which should have been done under the radar.  &amp; Why the heck can't you communicate with your player base and tell us what is going on, what updates are actually planned, if any.  I don't want to see another Dev Diary about a feature that was supposed to be implemented at the games release.  I want to see the next Dev Diary about War Z 2.0 - A major release that makes sense and allows us to go ""OH That's where my money went"".  Prove us wrong. Prove to us that the money didn't go to pockets, and random Movies, Office Props, Vehicles, and meaningless shit that none of us care about.

Thanks

Prockzed	78	32	113	"This game looks like it could be something incredible. I truly want to look forward to eventually (I understand alpha is alpha blah blah blah it'll be buggy for a while and playing in the pre-release will be to help them make it better) playing a very smooth, most streamlined kind of Zombie Survival game. I can't help but get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach when I hear about how the game could possibly be really a sham cashing in on DayZ's popularity. Now I know it's not vaporware, as how the hell could it be when places like IGN have had hands-on experience with it. I am worried when I hear things about the devs being untrustworthy due to past actions with previous titles. (I've heard a lot of talk about them lying about things with their last game War Inc.) It is also slightly concerning when I look at that aforementioned title to see it is honestly pretty damn bad. Sure it looks pretty but in terms of polish and overall gameplay it seems mediocre at best. 

Basically I'm just hoping someone can show me something that will allow me to place a bit more faith in this game. MAKE ME BELIEVE.

I confronted him and asked him about why I was banned for this post:

He accused me of breaking forum rules and posting when I was banned. When I had pointed out that I posted the feedback after the temporary ban was lifted, thus not breaking any rules, he not only removed the tweet but he blocked me from twitter:

Whoppah	61	23	67	"Every game I'm in I run into them, and I know this because I know exactly how the hacks work and what people do to utilize them. These guys with the ""ESP"" hacks literally run everyone scared on the servers, and wipe out an entire servers worth of loot. They can see you through walls, their guns have no spread, making their shotguns effectively become snipers, they also have infinite sprint, AND Aimbot. (I've been killed by clearly what I saw were mossbergs, from over 100m-150m in one shot)

There hacks are completely unacceptable, **I know the dev's are fully aware of these ESP hacks, but I'm not to sure they know how much damage they are actually doing.**

Before you go: ""ur a newb u suck at the game, shotguns can't sniep ur jst bad, gt a l1fe sergey said u cant hakz th1s gaem"" I've seen these hacks with my own eyes, my friend had gotten it and showed me how it works. I know what I saw, and I know that people run around single handedly taking out groups of 3-4 people on his own, taking the loot and skipping town. 

These hacks are real and chances are if someone said in global ""Hacker in city, 5 story, ect"" Chances are they're either hacking or glitching. Leave the server and hopefully you won't run into another one.

The whole point of this post is to really bring to light to everyone that there ARE hackers and there are more than many people think. There are some steps to take to get these players banned for good.

Here they are:

* Take screen shots of people doing hackish type things or wall glitching

* If your computer can record while playing this game, do it. You might just catch someone in the act.

* This one is important as it goes with the two points above; you want them to type to you. Engage them. Get them to admit it, it'll be even easier for them to get the hammer if they type in proximity. (To narrow down the possibility of it being them.)

* Videos and screen shots aren't enough to get someone banned, even with a name. (You won't know exactly who it was, **because there is no way to tell who it really was that was actually hacking.** (Or if he was hacking at all). If you do have some names just submit them to the WarZ Devs along with some evidence, and have them look into it. That's about as much as you can do.

One last note, this isn't something just the Dev's have to deal with, its us as players too. Its a group effort to crack down on these guys that like to take advantage of us. If they want a war, we'll give them one.

We are the ones testing this game, that's why they released an alpha, we have to do our part to deter these hacks as well. As I do agree the Dev's hold the most responsibly in the matter, players can do there part too.

*Edit: this is in the comments but it should have been in OP.*

Also, WarZ and the ESP hacks are going to be one step ahead of each other, one way or another... Like so:

* WarZ releases

* WarZ hack is developed and released

* WarZ Dev's patch it so it crashes when you inject the cheat (They actually did this)

* WarZ hack patches and fixes it

* Screenshot catcher is added

* Anti-screenshot software is implemented into WarZ hacks

It will be a never ending war, what needs to happen is people need to be 100% banned when you start to use it. There needs to be some sort of system to catch players in the act almost 100% of the time. THAT will make it so even if the hack works, you'll get caught."	t5_2ujwe	True

It's not even 24 hours after alpha release. Most big companies don't even have open alphas, they're closed because they have the resources to hire people to do it. That's why they're pretty (usually) polished on release day. Even public betas have a lot more work put into them than alphas. This is a testing phase, not a fun time ""check out our perfect game"" phase. Alpha doesn't mean ""Early access to a polished game for people that pre-order"".

Every time you run into a bug and think ""Oh wow, that shouldn't happen and ruins my experience,"" that's a GOOD thing. Don't go whine on reddit, go post on the alpha dev forum and let them know what you found.


If you want the experience you were clearly expecting, wait until the official release. Until then, your nonconstructive complaints make me laugh.

The sooner people realize this, the sooner I think people will appreciate this game more.


Edit: Forgot some thoughts.


* **Edit 2: You payed for the pre-order of the finished game and some perks at a cheaper price. If you payed solely for the alpha and are now complaining that it should be more playable before they accept money, you are just backing up my suspicions you had no idea what to expect. Had this been a closed alpha and beta, and the game was released almost perfect, there would be no issue. THIS IS NEEDED FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, you just have access to help. Generally you don't see this part of development, that's why you're all so spoiled and ignorant to the facts. This is even more asinine than people complaining when they bought Arma 2 for the purpose of playing the DayZ alpha.**

1350017566.0	11cook	What to expect on October 15th		185	150	31	"[Text from this post](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?19482-Finish-Line-Public-Alpha-Release-on-October-15th-development-update)

&gt;sergeytitov: hi guys and girls !

&gt;Just want to give you short update on what's going on with War Z and what to expect from the game between October 15th and October 31st. 

&gt;Lets start with where we're right now. Today we finally merged code between two dev branches and fixed our most notorious bug - zombies being stuck. Thing is that this bug was like our nemesis for quite some time - it cam and go, it only affected map where we had over certain number of active zombies ( like 1000 or so ), etc. We finally fixed it, and additionally fixed bug that allowed some zombies pass thru barricades. No more . Also new system allowed us to spawn way more zombies, so now cities became really really dangerous places to visit. 

&gt;We reworked zombie combat, so you'll find that zombies became much bigger threat than you saw in a ny of the videos. In fact ALL situations shown in any gameplay videos will be lethal under new AI settings. So - crouch, prone - this will be your only way to get past zombies, unless you have lots of stamina and willing to sprint for some time. Or you're super lucky son of the bitch and have lots of ammo and guns. Even in this case I'll run 


&gt;So next thing is October 15th launch. In preparation to launch we'll upload game client to our CDN. As you know you'll need to download game launcher ( aropund 5mb ) from link you've got in email recept. Actually anybody will be able to download this launcher - so there's no need to enter any passwords, etc, etc. We also hope you'll spread this launcher thru torrents, usenet, other sites helping more people to get it faster. 

&gt;Once you'll install it and launch you'll need to validate your serial by providing your serial number and e-mail used to order game. After that you'll create your account password and you'll be ready to go. Launcher will update game to most current version, and you'll be able to play game.

&gt;We'll have several hundreds servers available with more on standby. We're going to RESTRICT you to only part of the map - approximately 30%, opening up more and more as we;'re closing toward October 31st. Reason for that is that we want to make sure that you won't get lost and get most of the experience out of those two weeks of Alpha, but more important you'll help us fine tune game, performance, iron out bugs, etc. Trust me there's still shit load of places to explore for first week 

&gt;Since we're limiting access to map area, we're going to limit number of slots available to public. Here's how it works - normally each server will be set for Alpha at 70 players per server. But in options we can ""lock out"" certain number of slots for ""friends"" of server owner ( person who rent server ) - in this case - us . So we'll restrict servers to some number that will feel ""right"" - probably around 30-40 players - don't really know - we'll find out as we'll start getting feedback from you. 

&gt;Our goal for Alpha is to fine tune item spawns, zombie AI params, fix obvious gameplay bugs that we can't find until we'll have thousands of players online."	t5_2ujwe	True

* New map areas 
We're going to unlock around 30-40% more of the map space, adding new places to explore - including largest city on the map, jumbo cargo plane crash site and other interesting areas. More spawn points for players, more loot spawns as well. Those who felt a little bit claustrophobic on the map will find this update to be like a fresh air - lots of open spaces, grass fields, etc. 

* New zombie characters 
Yes, we're getting more zombies, and we also add new zombie types - I think 4-5 of them, including ""special zombies"" - so mutated zombie hunt season will be officially open

* New player characters 
We have 4 more characters for you. Two guys, two girls. Each have around 4 different skins

* Clans
Clans will be unlocked few days after October 31st. You'll be able to create clan, join clan, contribute to Clan Bank or reward your Clan Members from it. You also will be able to see if there're any clan members around you in the world, as well as have their names highlighted on the Players list screen. 


* More items 
More items, especially ""building blocks"" like barricades, brick walls, etc. Couple cool silenced ""improvised"" weapons. 

There'll be also tons of bug fixes, some performance optimizations, etc...

1. *Remain a Spidey subreddit i.e. stay unmoderated.* Continue posting your spiderman memes, llamas, cheese pizzas and whatever else you find amusing.

2. *Post anything as long as it's about TheWarZ.* ANYTHING about TheWarZ that includes controversies, news, tips, reviews, etc.

3. *Only allow content strictly about the game itself.* This means no controversies. This subreddit will be strictly about the game i.e. tips, patch notes, finding players, etc. It appears since the orange screen went up two new subreddits designed to meet this goal were created: /r/warz and /r/theofficialwarz. Perhaps they can combine to become strictly about the game and then this subreddit can be for anything including controversies.

I'm personally in favor of option 2. It's amusing to find out what the new WarZ controversy of the day is. Unfortunately these things continue to happen. It's hard to continue supporting this game with all the bad PR but I still have some faith. I think it's possible for them to redeem themselves after all this.

Anyway, this subreddit isn't about what I want or what any single moderator wants, it's about what the majority wants. I'll upkeep this subreddit based on what the community wants.

So voice your opinions/concerns, upvote/downvote, etc. 

edit 01/08/12. fixed grammar, removed some ranting, etc. 

Update 01/08/12. The majority of you appear to want Option 2 so we're going with that. Option 1 was obviously never a real option but it was provided for laughs. If there comes a time when there are less shady activities going on and the controveries die then this subreddit will naturally shift towards Option 3."	t5_2ujwe	True

Only to hear Jonny is sick and can't make it. That's alright, we can live with that, until we heard Jonny was in Summit's stream, making fun of AgentNorth, here's the chatlog with Kewk.

Here's a pastebin link because of the horrible formatting.

[1:35:51] Derpy hooves: Hey Kewk, any idea where Jonny is?
[1:37:33] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: he is sick
[1:37:45] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: and he got me sick but he is worse than me
[1:38:37] Derpy hooves: is he gonna be showing up for the talk with agent north?
[1:40:04] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: no
[1:40:22] Derpy hooves: If not, would you be willign to take his place in the agent_north talk? it's been decided for a whole week and the g uy's pretty damn upset right now....
[1:40:24] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: he's got bronchitis he aint got time for that
[1:40:52] Derpy hooves: as said, could you take his place? it's kinda important...
[1:41:17] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: Nope I am not prepared for it
[1:41:23] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: and I have other tasks
[1:41:41] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: I am serious about his bronchitis tho
[1:41:45] Derpy hooves: Well you said you're trying to support streamers, and agent north has been trying to help you guys since like the very start
[1:43:12] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: He will have to reschedule as we are unable to do last minute events like this they must be approved and I was not part of the even approval process so I dont even have any context about the whole thing
[1:44:37 | 1:44:45 bewerkt] Derpy hooves: this has been planned for a week, everything was done just like Jonny asked to have it done
[1:44:59] Derpy hooves: North could bring you up to speed with the context and what'll be discussed, it's not that much
[1:45:20] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: Sergey does not allow last minute changes like that as I said
[1:46:56] Derpy hooves: I honestly don't think it could be that difficult ot just ask Jonny to give you the script he prepared, and if he hasn't prepared a script that means he was going to wing it during the stream, and that's something you could do aswell.
[1:50:31] Derpy hooves: Any idea when Jonny is gonna be returning so we could schedule a reincheck?
[1:51:23] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: The internet says that Bronchitis can last 7-12 days
[1:51:35] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: I imagine he wont be in the office at tha ttime but I do not know for sure
[1:51:47] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: wont know until monday what is going on with him
[1:52:24] Derpy hooves: Alright, if you could get some words with him, at least could you ask?
[2:06:17] Patrick ""Kewk"" Bowman: Im leaving town after work all weekend so I wont talk to him till monday
[3:36:14] Derpy hooves: http://youtu.be/CFiKv4yl-QI
[3:36:18] Derpy hooves: kewk what the hell is this...?
[3:47:48] Derpy hooves: Gerald_parson: Russian Kaliber and Jonny where in Summits stream a few minutes ago

Chili_dog_66: johnny said you were not a "" top"" priority "" then he said he was just joking but..........
[3:47:52] Derpy hooves: aha....
[3:48:01] Derpy hooves: Chili_dog_66: johnny was also making fun of your round table post on warz forums
[3:55:13] Derpy hooves: North's been giving the middle finger by you guys apperantly, you say it's all alright, then you lie to me and to him saying that he can't make it cause he's sick, now I hear that he's in summit's stream laughing around about how bad ""north""  is and how he's a low end streamer that he has no importance to you guys, you guys need to get your goddamn shit straight, Agent has been supporting you guys since the fucking start and has done more for the community than summit, or fucking fagimis knvies have been doing, and you guys have been doing jack fucking shit for anyone besides those two.

I don't condone any of that and I think they've really shot themselves in the foot here. I think they rushed the game to Steam to get Christmas sales, and all this shit they've done in the past few days has been super scumbaggy, even moreso than some of the shit they've pulled in the past.

**I do legitimately think the game is fun and has a lot of potential**, but I think they just ruined any chance they had of showing that to the gaming world. They've now permanently soiled their reputation, and it's all downhill from here.

It's tragic really, because if they had just not nickle and dimed their customers, waited until the game was more polished to put it on Steam, and weren't so vitriolic against their customer base, I really think that people would've actually come around and seen that the game can be fun to play with its own merits. Now they'll never have that chance.

tldr the game is fun but the devs have scumbagged it up to the point of no return.

If you look at my older posts on this sub, you'll see that I've been actively engaged in the community and have supported it, and really do think it is fun... but this is too fucking much. Devs take note: this is how you turn a game with a large amount of potential into a PR disaster, and ruin the future of your game."	t5_2ujwe	True

1360663990.0	18dd7l	Bought the game 2 days ago.. Killed my first Bandit tonight		53	20	21	"Im very new to the game but not fps games. I usually tend to stick to low pop servers to farm and kinda learn the game.

Tonight I was farming Norad on a 3 ( including me ) pop server. The other two guys were bros both no where near me, both friendly. I usually keep tabs on who and how many people  join the server but Its 5 am so i figured it should be pretty dead. 

So anyway, Im running around the base carelessly not really scared because I know where the other 2 people are.  I come around one of the corners at the bottom of the heli pad and looking right at me is another player armed to the tits with gear. My reaction speed kicks in  I dodge back behind the wall, he does the same. We both sit there for about 15 secs seeing who has the balls to engage. I finally try to pull a sneak attack so me and my Kruger rifle run up the stairs to get a height advantage. I hear him running around. I jump down hide behind another wall. Sure enough he had the same idea as me. He was also trying to get on top. He jumps down unaware of where I was. I pop out .pop pop pop.He drops. 

loot explodes from his Military ruck. with a smile on my face I run over to see my rewards. M4s M16s medkits body armors helms pretty much everything. For most people this isnt anything special but for me, new to the game, this is much needed gear to get my GI rolling.

As I loot I read prox chat.. fucking hacker...

now i dont know about you but it seems like the number they got of 8 people being banned incorrectly is the biggest bs ever! and the really annoying thing is that a friend got banned for the exact same things as the second video and his just proves 

So im probably going to get downvoted for this or even the post might get deleted but this is proof that ppl are getting banned for no fucking reason

EDIT: alright so iv been doing A LOT more research and this is what i found out, that these voodoo items are where meant to actually be up in the sky or at the top of buildings but they screwed up and these $1 and rare loot fell onto the ground so innocents would pick them up none the wiser and would get banned for that, here is a screenie for an example.

Now these $1 are everywhere on the ground and ppl are picking them uyp and getting banned for no reason so i also looked up the amount of paypal complaints and found out there have been about 2000+ ppl now i dont know about you if a hacker gets banned i dont think they give a shit but if a normal person gets banned they will be angry and want there money back, so now if the devs were to unban these ppl it would look terrible on there part showing that they mistakenly  banned over 1000 ppl there really is no way out for them"	t5_2ujwe	True

While heading towards a safe zone with a couple of friends, we happened upon a couple of bandits camping the safe zone.  They'd run out, kill people, grab their loot, then run back in and stash the stuff.  Shady way to do it, but I understand the devs are looking into guards for the zones.  

Well we end up running into these bandits.  They take two of us out before we realize what's going on.  The other folks in my group get into a big firefight with them. They take one or two down, and the rest log out.  My friends go up to grab what's left of our gear for us, when a few minutes later the bandits come back.  They went to another server, ran to a better vantage point, then came back to our server and again got the jump on us.  Took another one of us down, but we finished all but one of them off and that person ran to the safe zone and logged.  

This sort of behavior is not only cheese factor 10, but is something that needs to be curbed at game level.  So how would you fix this issue?  

A couple of ideas I had were either:  

A) A server timer, where you can only swap servers once and then a 5-10 minute timer starts up in which you can't swap servers again during that time.  This allows you to change servers to join a friend, but stops the server hopping.  This would also promote more exploration instead of just hopping for gear.  Or...  

B) Make it so you can only swap servers if you log out inside of a safe zone.  While that would be a bit more extreme, it would also promote more exploration and less server hopping.  

I'm interested in how others would deal with the situation."	t5_2ujwe	True
1351725126.0	12fdqt	More zombies, more guns and more mayhem: one round with the latest patch	AngryGiraffe	38	6	7	"I heard the walkers had changed, somehow. They were moving faster, reaching farther, killing better. In my experience, rotting flesh usually decays, rather then improves -- but then again, I was a construction worker before the plague hit, not a mortician. I woke about a quarter mile from the edge of town and broke camp. I was out of supplies, no food, no tools -- nothing, but I heard the lakeside town was ripe for scavenging, if you could survive the competition. 



The police station was empty, and the roamers were far enough away I was at ease. Quiet morning, but a meek one. An old swat helmet lay in the corner. I was happy for the headgear, but I really could have gone for something to eat. Maybe in the -- fuck, what was that? I turned my head to see some idiot with a flashlight charging towards me, tailed by a handful of Zeds. One of the distant deadheads perked up at the commotion, and blankly stared my way. Shit. I dove out the pigpen's open window and made a break for it, rotting corpse in tow. Maybe I can lose him behind the motorhome? Nope. By cutting across an abandoned house's yard? Fuck all. Run. Run. RUN. 



Nearly out of breath, I spotted a stack of boxes near an old fence, and stumbled on top of them. Thank God these fuckers don't remember how to climb simple structures. I carefully walked along the fence top until I got over to the next yard out of the abomination's sight. Maybe that fool with a flashlight got mauled to death and left something useful behind. I crept back to the police station, hugging the building's wall, listening for signs of life. If he's still in there, he could easily bludgeon me to death with that maglight of his -- if he's not, I could be eating breakfast. I laid down to conceal my position and consider my options. Suddenly my eyes came into focus on an assault rifle, hidden under the bulk of a overturned police vehicle. Bam. Leverage. New weapon in hand, I slowly crept around to the station's side door, and locked eyes with the genius who almost got me eaten not five minutes earlier. Maybe he was scared. Maybe he was sorry. Maybe he wanted to be friends -- I couldn't take that chance. Pop. He went down, dropping my breakfast and his damned flashlight on the way. Murder for a granola bar and a gulp of water. I didn't used to be this guy, but you can only watch your friends get murdered for trying to help other survivors so many times before you snap, and stop trusting anybody. If the government ever gets its shit together and cleans up this mess, I suppose I'll have to answer for the pain I've caused. Can't think about that now. I'll think about that tomorrow. The gunshots attract a few roamers, and I take them down with what's left of my ammo. The rifle is spent, but I hold on to it anyway. Could be useful later. 



I decided to check out the fire station after breakfast -- they could have some leftover medical supplies. I think I saw it over where I climbed those boxes. I peeked out the window -- the Zed had wandered off, and the area was in the clear. Easy enough.



The firestation was empty, and littered with bandages, headgear, water, and of all things, a handgun. I pocket the grub and check out the gun. 13 rounds. Not bad. 



POP POP



FUCK. I back against the wall. Someone's shooting at me. Damn Karma. Hugging the brick I pop out and get a couple shots off. A woman. I'm pretty sure I nicked her, but I can't tell. I advance forward quietly, and aim my new friend at where I expect her to come out of the hallway, gently squeezing the trigger as I see her approach. She's down. Shit. This is getting dangerous. 



I pick up the pieces and score a mossburg, another handgun, and some other weapon that I don't quite recognize. Either way, it's out of ammo. My pack overflowing with weaponry, I run across the street, looking for food and cover. I can hear gunshots ahead of me, but soldier on. Nothing behind me to scavenge, may as well, right? I can't find the source of the shots, but guess that they might be coming from the supermarket. I poke my head in and -- fuck. Zombies. And they all see me. I glance around for any well stacked boxes. No? Fuck. Run. RUN. 



I dash across a parking lot and an empty yard, desperately looking for some high ground. Nothing. Nowhere.



I skirt around the edge of a fence, near an old car mechanic shop. I'm getting tired, and can't run much longer. Maybe I should put this mossberg to use. I hold my ground as Zeds creep up the fence line. POW, the shot echos across the surface of the lake. One down. Five shots left. POW. Again and again. I take a few hits reloading. Another Zed takes notice. Fuckity shit, man. My last shell expires, and I throw the gun to the ground, sprinting through the fence with the last of my breath, ducking into the mechanic's old garage. I think I lost them. I look in my pack to see what's left -- almost nothing, and I'm out of ammo.




I look up to hear a slow groan as three more Zombies approach. Completely out of breath and bleeding out, I grab a rusty hammer off the bench and swing at my attackers. In a moment, I know it's all going to be over. 



Maybe I should have given that fella in the police station the benefit of the doubt. 






***tl;dr:I'm actually finding plentiful firearms now. Executed a zombie aggro fool in the police station, defended myself in the fire station, and got relentlessly chased down by the new horde. New zombies are way scarier, and I felt much more like a survivor then before the patch. Don't know if I like the huge range (that's a little bullshit) but was def one of my most fun, most compact sessions ever.***"	t5_2ujwe	True

I had been playing on ultra until I was spotted multiple times without ever seeing the other person. I finally decided to give a try to low terrain decorations and my goodness. Its a totally different game. So many times I thought i was hidden and for people on low settings i was out in the open. I know this is somewhat of a system limitation. People have talked about all these different servers for different game types. Could we have different servers for different levels of terrain.

Don't get me wrong I really enjoy the game and playing it with my friends, but when my friends aren't around I may as well not even play. Since they merged the servers there are virtually no low-pop servers to safely play on solo. I understand that it is a survival game and your best shot at surviving is with a group, but you're not always going to have a group to play with. This makes the game incredibly hard to play solo because what used to be ""deserted"" towns, where it was safe to play alone, are now contested areas like the larger cities on the map. 

I know that private servers have not been made available yet and this may remedy the issue, but I still think they need to cater to some of the solo players who won't have the benefits of a private server or who don't always have a group to play with.

**TL;DR** New server merges make playing solo nearly impossible. 

**EDIT:** I want to make it clear that the solo play I'm talking about is when you first start out and you have nothing or close to nothing. (i.e. Flashlight and Potato Chips) With all these people who kill on sight and the increased server populations it's so difficult to find decent weapons (guns) and survive against the human element."	t5_2ujwe	True

At first I wanted to be ""friendly"" and team up, but I figured quite quickly it's easier to obtain loot by killing other players, and the rush is like no other. There's nothing like stalking a sniper for an hour, to bludgeon him in with the hammer he dropped a while back to make room for more loot.

However, the sheer amount of kids crying over dying through pvp is unreal, and it looks like the devs are gunna cave in. Yes, server hopping to exploit weapons was broken - and I can say I never participated in that - but I am now worried for my stash. I have at least 5 of every gun stashed - all through legit pvp kills. I have spent HOURS getting these weapons, bags, medical supplies etc, if they get removed cos a few kids can't handle that THIS IS A PVP SURVIVAL game... Well, I don't know what I'll do.

I bought this game because I wanted a realistic survival, and whilst the zombie AI needs work, the pvp is excellent. I have never gotten such a rush before from a game in my life. I physically shake after pvp encounters that I have won, my heart races and I feel so alive.

When I die, I don't feel annoyed or mad, I see this as an opportunity - I need to get a better stash for next encounter to win. I don't rush to the forums to say OMFG GUY KILLED ME I WANT REFUND PVP SO GAY FAGGOT BANDITS."	t5_2ujwe	True

You want tips?
Don't trust anyone, join a clan, zombie AI sucks so you can abuse the shit out of it, when fighting zombies continue to back up - this lets you take on as many as you want as long as you are smart about it, military guns are at norad/airport/splinter/meteor station/scattered through out randomly through small towns, usually found in police stations or farms.

Nightm4re	35	9	58	"So a server caps out at 40 people... so even if we get 20 friendly people on the server that limits our encounter to 20 possible hostile players. I say we choose a server at random and use that as our preferred server. We can set up dates/times and organize it as an event for all of us to join up and play together. We could host meet ups where we all meet at a specific safe zone, spawn with a flashlight and go steamroll through towns/cities killing every zombie along the way.

Thoughts/opinions on this? I say we choose server 250 (random number). Think about how crazy it would be to have a group of 20-30 people running into a town/city all at once.

* shouldn't have to say this but we won't play with hackers

When we encounter other players that we don't know we will usually kill them unless we're currently naked. Doesn't everyone?

Sometimes we will server hop, sometimes we will make large sweeping loops around the whole map. We don't play on very large servers unless we're *really* wanting a fight.

**Introduction**
      Hi! I've been playing Infestation for about 7 months now and along the way I've picked up some tricks I figured I could share with the community. This guide will be focused on looting highly dangerous zones that contain lots of zombies to accompany the better loot they hold. 



**1.) Tiers of Loot**

4 relevant tiers of loot appear at these military locations, these include item box spawns, military weapons, military apparel and military scout spawns. 

**2.) Locations on the map**

The following locations spawn high grade loot as seen in section 1:

*Norad Military Base*

*Ridgeway airport* 

*Camp splinter*

*Campos City* 

*Boulder City*

*West Boulder Meteorological station* 

Each location has a unique mix of spawns, routes, and various other factors that you need to take into account when choosing your location. Campos is close to the safe zone, while it has a fraction of the amount of spawns that can be found at the further locations. Boulder has a nice mix of food, meds, and civilian weapons as well as tons of ammo, yet you have a lot of ground to cover to check all the spawn points. 




**3.) Needed Supplies**

Before you embark to go loot you need a couple of items to ensure maximum proficiency and safety in your loot runs.

-1 personal Locker

-2 Vaccines

-Some Water

-A handful of meds

-A melee (Preferably a 2 hit like a Hatchet or Katana. )

-Large back pack or bigger

-Binoculars (Optional)


**4.) looting methods**

 Now that you know where to go and what to bring, the question is how do you use it? The Vitals and the backpack speak for themselves, but what the heck do you need a lockbox and binocs for if your just looting? With the new feature of being able to pick up your lockbox, you can travel the map with your box serving as a safe haven to kill zombies from. there are only two ways to be completely safe from zombies while swinging on them, a gap (Even then they can swing on you sometimes,) or a lockbox. Place your lockbox and swing on the surrounding zombies with your melee until you've disposed of the undead.

Quickly place your box and jump on top of it: http://i.imgur.com/kO6QskD.jpg

Swing until they are all dead: http://i.imgur.com/YkdGYL7.jpg

Side Tip: Check zombie bodies for ammo.

Binoculars can be used while in third person to loot from even longer distances. Going into third person and zooming give your longer item reach, binocs give you and even longer one.


**5.) Loot Recovery**

Whenever possible be ready with another character to recover your items, or shell out for the Revive to get your loot back should you die.

**6.) Muling and Banking** 

When your all full bring your loot back to the Safe Zone, hold shift or hit num lock and relax for a bit :).


I hope this helped! Enjoy, and happy farming!

1369792061.0	1f8oi8	Fed up with the lack of development and action against hackers	BankableChicken	36	13	77	"Please bare with me while I rant.

I'm a pre-alpha player that decided to pay the $50 for the legendary package to support this company and development team on what could have been such a great game. If you read a more recent comment of mine in another thread on this subreddit, you know that I was a LEGIT top 30 player in kills in this game at one point, and a huge supporter.

What really is grinding my gears now, even though I haven't seriously played this game in over a month is: The developers are more caught up with giving free shit to streamers (game keys to give out) and running around with them for server events than fixing the issues at hand for the rest of the community. Why the fuck is kewk getting escorted by Dakotaz (love dakotaz, dont get me wrong) instead of working on a real anti-hack, or getting other things implemented in this game? Dude. stop playing the fucking game and fix it for the rest of us.

I just read a ""pre-patch notes"" for this week, and it looks like for the past 3 weeks, they've been working for about 3 days. Being totally oriented to the development and programming community, and acquired a degree in exactly that myself, the lack of progress and development on this game is ridiculous. I'm beginning to believe more and more the guys that said this was a cash-grab from the beginning.

Furthermore, the fact that johnnytruant still has a job after being caught on video spawning in rare items for sale for real $$$ on a trading site is fucking ridiculous. Hacked? Right after your HUGE security update? Come on. At least make up a better story than that. Not to mention, then he's absent for 2 weeks because he's sick? I don't buy it. If you suspended him, tell us, its better than lying to us. And kewk, knowing you frequent this subreddit and will read this, more than half your community knows your full of shit at this point. You have a great game with great potential on your hands and you're throwing it down the toilet.

Your legit players (which at this point, with ***out, is probably less than 10%) are tired of dying to hackers 10x more than zombies and legit players combined. I'm also willing to bet a good amount of money that the majority of these *** users only use it because they're just as sick as I am of getting ESP hacked (I won't stoop to that shitstorm level). For the love of WarZ (if you even care), just put a decent anti-cheat on this game, work on fixing your current map instead of developing a new one, and communicate with your community just a little bit more. It would not take much to make this game the all-star on the market, even after DayZ SA is released, but you have to care at least a little bit. So much potential in this game, and so little initiative to make it happen, its sad.

To any and all of you FEW legit players still out there - do yourself a favor and take a break and/or quit until a definitive anti-cheat has been added. Its what I did, and I'm gladly still sitting with a stocked global waiting for the day. Quit wasting your legitimately earned items and getting killed by these faggots using ***. Save them and wait so you can own these hacking scrubs when they have to play legit. I'm looking forward to it.

Also, after the proof that ZejX is a hacking SOB using *** just the same as the rest, I'm confident that I was one of less than 10% in the top 100 of kills and negative reputation. Get a life you hacking scrubs. Can't wait til there is an anti-cheat and I get to shit all over you when you're forced to play legit.

EDIT: i would like to point out that I just checked, and 20 minutes after this post I am still ranked 96th on the leaderboards with 504 civilian kills, without ever touching a hacking program or script. As I stated before, I'm willing to bet real money that less than 10 of these players in the top 100 are legit.


EDIT 2: buried somewhere in the comments (might be at the top now) Kewk responded to this post, and we had a small discussion about some of the topics mentioned. Also took out the name of aformentioned hack to save Kewk some hearthache

1351093551.0	120djy	Why I killed you.	captainchloroform	64	39	71	"So the most popular topic on this subreddit and on the forums that past few days has been spawnkillers/PKers, and I would like to offer my humble opinion on the subject.

While I do not actively camp spawns or safe zones, I will kill you if I see you. My reasoning for this is simple:

Survival.

This is the entire point of the game. Find enough food and water to survive is the only goal. My only goal. And if you are between me and that goal, you will be attacked on sight. Sure that player may have just spawned 30 seconds ago, but that town they are heading to is full of items I need to survive. Those are my items. That is my town. If I let them live, I am essentially letting them steal from me, and ain't nobody got time for that. That player could also head down to that city, find a hammer, and come back to hunt me down, which is a risk I am not willing to take. (It is even riskier to let new spawns survive as of the 10/23 patch, because they can spawn in with weapons in their inventory.) If I see a player coming from or going to a safe zone, they could have a weapon or a good haul of food and water. These are items that will further me towards my goal. Killing them is the only logical choice.

Now I know that there are spawn and safe zone campers, but I really don't think the actual camping is as prevalent as everyone thinks. 

Sure I might kill a new spawn, or someone near a safe zone, and then another player might kill a new spawn or whatever, but there is no way to differentiate between spawning and getting killed by 2 different players, or just 1 camper. Not knowing who killed you is a huge reason why people are making these outrageous claims.

I have played the alpha nearly everyday since release, and with the exception of the first few days, I have not been spawn killed at all. Not once. I have died and respawned plenty of times so it's not like it is a rare event for me.

Anyway, my point is, this is a survivor game, and if you are not willing to do what it takes to survive, then you will be dead. You could essentially win the game by creating a character and never logging on to a server giving you a 100% survival rate. Is that the kind of game you want carebears?

I also have been invited to WarZ dev event and winning the event. But to be honest I play to entertain, because the social factor to the game and correlating it with my stream will open doors for not only me, but all who stop by.

History: I initially began streaming TOR and WOW. I found that even though i may not be that good at these games, by streaming and interacting with viewers, i was able to comprehend the social factor to streaming which what made me really start streaming heavily.

Currently I am playing The WarZ and League of Legends, and would love it for anyone to come to kushho's stream and hangout, for it is one of the chillest place on twitch. Imagine a place where you can discuss anything, where there are minimal mods, the only rule is not to troll, and you have a awesome broadcaster interacting with you wonderful viewers and streamers constantly throughout the Live Stream.

One of the main reasons I created this stream is so that I can enjoy video games with my Cousins: Yodis, Edweezy, and Snorlax415. It is a way for us to communicate with each other now that we have grownup and have our own lives. I’m usually enjoying some great ""Trees"" while streaming so let’s just all enjoy hanging in the clouds together! In the stream I also have a few Social Events implemented like Viewer Fridays(where i play with the viewers all day for about 15+hrs), Skype/Vent Party Chats, and Real Talk with Kushho(w just talk about whatever people want and focus in on the issue).

I know its a long post, but just to let you know you always be entertained in Kushho's Stream! cause we be CHILLIN!!!Just slide through and holla at ya boy Kushho, and while your there just sit back, relax, take a puff of some good green and enjoy the stream!!!

1352536470.0	12ygue	Idea: Roaming Zombie Swarms?	NutellaCrepes	35	12	13	"Some of you may have read the book World War Z, or perhaps just saw the trailer...or simply understand the concept from other stories such as The Walking Dead. 

The roaming zombie swarms are basically a large group of zombies, that just kind of roam around aimlessly and are more often than not too much to handle for any lone survivor. 

What it can do for WarZ: 

- A sort of dynamic event to watch out for while discovering the map.

- Strategy could form around.

- Once settlements are included, the owners will have to worry about more than just a few zombies and players 
and equip themselves accordingly. 

- Perhaps, when in swarm, not even cars are little safe zones and will get damaged by the zombies trying to get to you. So hiding over ""nuh nuh nuh can't get me"" /disconnect

- Allow for some co-operation between players to bring the swarm down (it would probably have a decent re-spawn time)

The Negative (that I can think of):

- If not well implemented, it could cause grief in the sense that someone might try to get the attention of the swarm to a specific location. 

So that's again just an idea, I'm sure there are many pros and cons that come with. What do you guys think?"	t5_2ujwe	True
1352480984.0	12x5ij	First ~20 minutes impressions from someone who has never played DayZ		33	12	31	"Disclaimer: I have never played DayZ -- it seemed interesting to me, but the bugs and jank of it didn't ever let me justify buying Arma II for it. I will definitely try it when the standalone comes out though.


I got tired of all the downvote selfishness on the WarZ Guest Pass subreddit so I just got a trial key from the IGN Prime promo. I Just played my first ~20 minutes of WarZ:


Spawns me in the middle of the woods, I check out my map and head towards the closest town to try and find some supplies (maybe a melee weapon or a gun if I'm lucky). I stumble upon my first zombie aggro as soon as I get into town -- I club him down with my flashlight after a dozen or so swings. That wasn't so bad. I sneak along the side of the first building, what appears to be an abandoned grocery, I peek around the corner and see a shiny new M16 just lying on the ground, waiting for me to loot it. As I inch my way toward it, it disappears. I start to back-peddle like a mad man, and duck back around the corner. I hear footsteps and see another survivor poke his head out the grocery store door and then go back inside. A few seconds later gunshots are fired. Did the survivor meet his death? Was it a zombie attack or another survivor got the best of him? I start to panic and sneak around the other side of the building, checking out the abandoned store next to the grocery; nothing of interest in there. I head back to the grocery, thinking that maybe the survivor just got bested by the local zombies inside, and hope that maybe I can snag that M16 that I had intended to loot earlier (everything in this game is full-loot...you die, you drop all your gear). I peek inside and it looks clear, besides a lone zombie just shambling in a small circle. I hug the inside wall and make my way to the back of the store. I find binoculars, rifle ammo, and a flare. My first real loot findings! Woot! I take a second to sort my inventory and have bite of a granola bar -- *bang* *bang* -- I'm dead. Just like that. No idea if it was the original survivor or a new one, but I can't help but feel like I was bait and switched. I'm dead and have to start all over, damn it that was awesome. I haven't felt that kind of suspense and pressure in a game since I first discovered Minecraft survival-mode years ago when it was still in alpha.




Right after that death I made a new guy and managed to kill a dozen zombies and snag a large backpack, hammer, some shotgun ammo, and some helmets/masks and stash most of it (minus the large backpack...sadface) in my global inventory before being gunned down as I was scavenging a house in the NW outskirts of the map. 



Before playing The WarZ I was struggling with the fact that *yeah* they may be ripping off DayZ, *yeah* they are reusing a ton of assets from their other game, and *yeah* there may be some shameful motives in the making and marketing of The WarZ -- but the fact is, I'm having fun and the people who are working on the game seem very intent on making sure it's the best game they can make it be. Whether or not it was actually conceptualized before or after DayZ is moot to me because the bottom line is that it's a concept and game framework that **works** and most of all is **fun as hell** and they have executed it well enough to allow me to look past all the drama and speculation. 

I'll probably be picking up a Pioneer or Legend copy of the game once my trial ends. Keep up the good work, Hammerpoint. "	t5_2ujwe	True

It's not an excellent game, and it's still rough around the edges at some points, but it is a WHOLE lot of fun. I had a friend pick up the game as well and we're having a ton of fun farming loot and stabbing zambos in the face with a pickaxe. 

Not only that but I actually find the rarity of ammo in the game rather refreshing. DayZ has rare ammo, but this game is a whole other level. It really makes you sit there and think ""Am I going to go in here guns blazing, or am I going to try and get in stealthily?""

They have manipulated people into a false hope that the game will develop properly and will be a fully functional game.

####

Ok so, after about three weeks of trying to do well in this game eventually I got frustrated because every time I would finally find a good weapon I would lose it to a glitch/bandit etc, and I never seemed to find any of the more rare weapons. Also the thought of making 16500 for NVG's seemed impossible when I had all of $200 in my account. Last night this all changed, and I'm going to share with you what I learned so that you might benefit as well.

First I'll start with gear, as it is what makes your character at this point:

Lets explain the mechanics of the loot in the game to make this easier. Loot spawns randomly at certain hot spots in the world. There are locations/objects which will spawn weapons among their loot, and I will list them here:

1. Supermarkets
1. Post Office
1. Police Station
1. Military tents
1. Military towers
1. Military vehicles
1. Police vehicles
1. Civilian vehicles
1. Strongholds

There are more, but these are your best bet. In addition, the weapons that spawn will be in relation to the object they spawn in, but not strictly. IE: You will find military grade loot at military locations, but that doesnt mean you wont find m4's and AK's in a supermarket.


More over, I discovered a strange mechanic about loot. It seems to spawn as a reaction to players. I'm not sure if it is a consequence of rendering or what the mechanics are exactly, but I'm sure you've all been walking towards a location only to get a glimpse of loot apparently falling from the sky (not from very far) and landing at their location. This is usually most apparent on vehicles. I'm not sure how this relates to the amount of loot, however. I figure each spawn point in a location has a timer and if you wait long enough, all those timers will prime, and the loot will spawn once triggered by proximity.


**If you keep visiting a hotspot and never find loot there, it's not because of bad luck.**


The higher tier players are farming this loot. This is much like other mmo's with things on a timer where people will find an untriggered stash, loot it, and note the time. I believe it's 10-15 minutes. Believe me, if you stick around, you will see a group show up later to collect the loot again as it spawns. This is most obvious in high quality rare loot locations such as the helicopter crash.


**How does this help me?**


Well upon simple observation, you need to get to these location before the farmers do and pick up the loot. How do you do this? I always felt I was one step behind the people collecting the loot, and even when I wasnt, I was outgunned when they showed up to claim their rounds.


Over time I noticed that late at night when most of the US servers are not very populated, I could go to certain places and find good loot. Sadly you cant do this all the time and honestly the US servers are never -that- empty. The solution? Last night I went over to the EU servers.


**Some of the servers had 2-3 players.**


I spent a lot of time at Boulder city, collecting loot from the broken bridge to the west and the rifles that spawn under the humvee's. There's also a helicopter in the center of the city that spawned a Custom Guerrilla armor set.


For the sake of lists, heres a list of the locations I visited frequently on extremely low populated servers and what I found there:


**Whitestone Mountain village.**
~ There's been talk about a bug here that kills you but I've not run into it, if someone can pinpoint the exact location then we can avoid it. Last night I found a Saiga and several M4 semis, along with a boatload of ammunition for high end weapons. I also found several pistols but I forget which.


**Echo's Compound**
I found 2 AKMs and an AA-12 (along with a mossberg and other meh guns). A warning about this location: There is a hill behind the compound where bandits can easily ambush you there, I only suggest going there if the server has very low population or if you have a buddy that can sneak up on the hill while you bait would be snipers. 


**Smallville**
Kalel's home is a quaint one. I prefer Smallville to Clearview for several reasons. It is located in a ""valley"", so anyone approaching the village is easy to spot going down the hillside. Be vigilant. Strangly enough I found more weapons in the supermarket than I did in the police station or the church stronghold there, but your experience may vary. 


There are more, such as the village on the road next to the fallen trees. If you draw a line from Hill Ranch to Castle Pine, its in the middle there, on the road. This place isnt good because of the amount or quality of loot it spawns, but because it doesnt see a lot of traffic.


**Ok great, but what about MONEY. I want Night Vision man!**
People have repeated it, but it went in one ear and out the other for me because I was simply unaware of how this works, so here I am to explain it to you. Certain zombie mobs drop money. I'm not sure if this cycles, but I can guarantee that Boulder city and Whitestone Mountain zombies drop a shit load of money. Last night I had $200 to my name, today I have 14k and after this I'm going to go farm for the last 2.5k for my NVGs.


**Thats great and all, but I'm really really bad at this. Can you help me?**

Well if you struggle with the things mentioned above then I suggest sticking to the northmost area of the map. The villages all along the large river there have plenty of loot and weapons and are often not populated. Better yet, due to the proximity to the mountains and the presence of the lake, it is less likely you will get ambushed because you have fewer angles to worry about.


Now that I mention that, I should also mention this:


**Binoculars are OP/IMBA**
I used to see an extra pair of binos and Id leave them there saying nah I already have. Wrong. Binos stack, and they are sooo important. Pick them all up. Drop them all off in your inventory. Use them often. Spotting someone well ahead of them spotting you is extremely key. As the very helpful guide posted here by another redditor explains, observation is key.


**Lastly, I will close with a little info about zombies that I discovered today. I felt stupid when I realized.**


Headshots kill zombies, we know this. However, **when I fight a zombie I usually just hold down attack or spam attack. This is inefficient** because after being struck a zombie will stumble for a moment. If you hit him again you will miss his head as he stumbles. The fastest way to take out a zombie is one swift hit to the head, and another -after- he recovers his stance. And then again. Dont be afraid to get hit, your hammer swing is far quicker than their undead hugs.


As proof of concept, here are my spoils from last night. Everything you see here I earned last night because the day before I died several times and lost any redeeming items I might have had:

Note that I made the 10k by killing 430 zombies.



**Some other notes and observations:**
Now that you have binoculars and you are scouting out a city before you rush in, I advise you to do the following.

Take a loot at the hill on the farside of a city that you are at. Notice how the game renders this at this distance. I'm not sure about all graphic settings but lets assume the lower the graphics the less is rendered, ergo your worst case scenario. From far, player models stick out like a sore thumb. If you are sitting on a hill and you think you're totally ninja invisible because you are in the brush, you're dead wrong. More over, some trees that have very low laying canopys arent reliable either, as from far you are still quite visible. Things that always get rendered are rocks and the trunk of trees. Positioning is vital. I've found its best to consider the long range and short range implications of the location you are chosing to camp. Ergo, try and find a spot that, from far away, you or your silhouette is in front of a tree (or behind it if the area of contention isn't very far.) You will still get spotted by binoculars, but only if they look specifically at that tree for a moment. ""But what about the people that come from the sides"". This is why you want to find a location that has some sort of ingress to your 9 and 3. It doesnt have to be significant, so long as you arent directly visible from very far. Up close is a different story because the grass will keep you concealed. ""What about behind me?"" Well unless you are sitting in a flat field... Lets assume you are in a slighly elevated location. From behind you, is there an easy way to spot your location from far? Then you're good. If the distance is short enough (learn these metrics) anyone coming behind you wont see you naked on an empty field, you will be obscured by trees, and the distance they require to spot you is enough for you to hear them."	t5_2ujwe	True

&gt;Many of you have noticed my rather sudden presence on the forums here. For an informal introduction, my names Tyler, and I'm the Senior Producer here. Much of my time has been spent behind the scenes on development, but now you'll find me more present, and I will endeavor to answer your questions.

&gt;The bottom line here is that we love our community, and you are all a very important part of the development process. Your feedback and testing is helping us to put together the best possible game we can.

&gt;Now, to some of your questions.

&gt;The wipe:
- We will be wiping all inventories
- We will be resetting player's reputations
- We will also reset all gold coins. Any you received through purchase of a package WILL be given back to you (so you will lose nothing you paid for)
- We will be resetting all characters stats
- We do not, however, have a final date. I assure you this is something at the forefront of my mind, and as soon as we get it settled I will let you all know

&gt;Item Spawns
There have also been some complaints about item spawns (ie food doesn't spawn often enough, too many weapons spawn in certain areas, no weapons in others). I'll be sweeping the map confirming a proper distribution of item spawns in the coming days to mitigate any issue there.

&gt;Also, hats! So many damn hats! To fix the issue of hats taking up item spawns, we'll be implementing a fix that causes spawned items to despawn after a certain amount of time, freeing up those slots.

&gt;PvP vs PvE
There's been a number of discussions about PvP and PvE. When Stronghold servers are up and running (and we'll have a bunch of smaller super sexy maps for you as well) these can be password protected, so you can run your server as you like.

&gt;Social
Clans are in active development and will be done next week. These will add a clan tag to the users name, and members of a clan will be able to see clan mates in game by an icon over their heads.

&gt;Friends! Friends list, join game with friends, and seeing your friends in game is next in the queue after Clans.

&gt;I hope that clears up a few things- a big part of my time will be spent with the community, figuring out the big issues and keeping an open line of communication with you about progress on the items you are most concerned about. You'll also see survey's popping up on Facebook, here, and when exiting the game. Please please PLEASE answer these, as they really help us out.

&gt;Thats it for now - I'll see you in game!

1351496437.0	129ko7	A couple simple easy ways to make killing zombies more fun.	angusmacdonald	34	10	25	"- **Make melee weapons do more damage to them.** 

If zombies were as easy to kill with melee weapons, as players are to kill with guns. Maybe you'd see more zombie hunters then player hunters.


- **Make bullets pierce zombies and go right on through.** 

How many zombies can you kill with one bullet? Can you kill a player and a zombie at the same time? What's your sickest zombie shot?


- **Make zombie kills help people on their way to *Hero* status.**

Who wouldn't want to be a hero? But healing people, who has the time? People like killing.


- **Make them gib.** 

People like gibs. (This might be a little tougher)


- **Make them drop loot.** 

People like loot.


- **Put hats on some zombies**.
 
Make killing them the only way to get hats. (Besides the marketplace). In this way you won't find hats when you're trying to find useful loot and if you want a hat, well now you can enjoy killing those zombies."	t5_2ujwe	True

Just because there is few videos and pictures on it, doesn't mean it's fake or whatever everyones saying.. The devs simply didn't wan't publicly yet. I'm pretty sure they decided to come out around this time was because it's the same time as the DayZ hype and somewhat fall. (Considering there is only about 50k active DayZ players)

1371978697.0	1gwgty	The mystery of the Rockyford Number Station (creepy WarZ myth documented, video included)	Raptor_Jasus	31	12	48	"There have been a few posts on Reddit, and even on the WarZ forum about this anomaly in Rockyford often described as a 'relay station' that emits creepy noises and music.

This was first reported 2 days ago, but it has been in-fact going on for at least 1 week (or that was when I first discovered and recorded it with a friend). It mostly happens on US001, but has been reported to appear on US002, as well.

This 'relay' station, is what I assume to actually be some sort of number station, it seems to play old Cold War era recordings from legit number stations, but some of them, the more HD/clearer recordings 'it' plays I've never heard before, and they sound newer too, as if the devs perhaps created them and are waiting for someone to crack the code (the morose code in the video could be it too~).

Perhaps the most creepy thing that happened during this recording, besides my graphics card crashing twice, WarZ crashed for my friend 3 times, and 4 people running into the building and never coming out (the 'building', is that house in the video), or the fact that not one, but two Number Stations appeared to 'talk' at the same time, and that the 'player/station' name was NOT in the player list at all, was the SSTV signal that the station began to play. At first I had no idea what it was, until I was showing it to a friend in class when my teacher came over and said ""hey, is that an old SSTV?"", after he explained what an SSTV was (Slow-scan television (SSTV) is a picture transmission method used mainly by amateur radio operators, to transmit and receive static pictures via radio in monochrome or color.) I went home and then dug deep into the internet to find a program that could decode the SSTV signal into an image. The results, were terrifying. The image was distorted, when the image was being decoded slowly my heart began to race, blood pumped through my body as my eyes started watering (you know that feel you get when talking about aliens?) and I held my breath as a set of eyes were revealed. Truly the shit of nightmares, this Radio Station, or Relay Station, is the scariest shit I have ever seen in a video game.

If this is the work of the WarZ devs, congrats, you have officially made me hide out in the north of the map, I shall never venture to Rockyford again. ;~;

It cost $15, which isn't to much, and with a bit of luck (And maybe a tiny bit of support from the community) this can be turned into a good game! I like it, but like most games there are some features that I don't like. Here's just a list of points and my opinions that have been brought up and fought over amongst the community of the last couple of months:

Hackers defeating the point of the game. We see this all the time in other games, and yeah, we get mad by it, but this is fixable, its not game ruining. I'm sure they could fix this.

Respawn times are too long. I don't like how it's just changed from 1 hour to 4 hours in order for your character to respawn, and if you want a respawn early then you have to pay, but if we let them listen to the community instead of forcing all the hate upon them, then maybe they'd change it! 

Lack of features in game. Yeah, the basic's are there, but other aren't. This can't be argued with since it's only in beta, and if there is evidence to suggest that they only started work on the game 6 months ago, then they've done a pretty good job so far!

They stole attributes of the game from War Inc. So? Think of all the call of duty games, you don't think they make those from scratch do they? They need some basis that they can work on, and they took a previous game that they developed. I would've done the same thing if I was a developer!

Their relationship with the community and their attitude towards it. Now this really does annoy me, probably the most out of everything. But I just tend to ignore it, I play the game with a friend, have a few laughs, die, use another character or just play some Counter Strike! I think we're both to blame for communication between developers and community, and it's hard for me to ignore it when The War Z is popping up left right and center in every gaming forum known to man.

Deception from the developers during advertisement. How does this hurt the community exactly? Or effects of the game? I don't care what they did, they made a mistake and did something they shouldn't have, but it doesn't effect the gameplay of the the game. I can deal with that to be honest.

Just to sum up what I'm trying to say, the community and the developers need a better relationship and understanding between each other. At the end of the day, It was hammerpoints fault by making false promises with false advertising. But these were only made false when hammerpoint couldn't keep up to what they wanted to make! And the relationship between community and hammerpoint was destroyed by the barrage of complaints which has caused the developers to lose their fanbase, so they now no-longer wish to talk to use anymore.

Who knows? Maybe they read these threads and are working on making the game better but keeping to themselves? I doubt it, but I'm always hopeful.

This route is dangerous but the route is fast and there are much loot spawns around so its pretty worth it. Alot of people around most of the time and so for best results join a low population server. You should run this route if you're armed with at least a pistol and or a shotgun; at least to use the weapon for suppressing fire to keep any bandits away. Also binocular are a must; keep an eye on the highway because there may be snipers up there.

Medicore safe route. The town and the barn are clear most of the time; the military encampment is not. Avoid the military encampment if you found cool stuff in the town.

You'd have a damn legitimate reason to get up on a truck/car, and you'd have to really pick your route safely.

 It would also be efficient against snipers in the woods. It would need some gunshots to put down (like a real bear) revealing the location of the snipers/bandits if they're camping. It would need some hammer/flashlight hits to the head. It would drop food (raw meat. Cures hunger, lose a little health eating) and yield a larger amount of XP.  This would encourage people to hunt bears too, and not spend ammo PK'ing. Thoughts?"	t5_2ujwe	True

1364666099.0	1bb8nj	I feel like the dev's have given up on the game!	GameAddikt	46	27	47	"Hear me out, this definitely isn't a War Z hate post.  I have been supporting this game since it first came out, I have fought the ""haters"" and have enjoyed playing the game for quite some time but let's look at hard facts, the Dev's have given up on this game!

1). A couple of weeks ago a large patch came out for the game apparently ""fixing"" all the loot spawns, military loot in military areas, civilian loot in civilian areas, yada yada yada.  This patch DESTROYED the game!  For awhile there meds were just...nowhere to be found, yes meds are back in the game (somewhat) but ammo is still nonexistent, my buddy and I play every night and we haven't found a single stanag clip since the patch, anybody found a stanag clip?  I have found, in total ONE Kruger mini clip and ONE 9mm clip.

Meanwhile the community is crying out at the Dev's asking what it is they are actually doing...what is the plan in the long run...so far, as far as I am aware there has been no answer.  The Dev's just don't seem to care anymore, they don't communicate with the community, and they treat everything they are doing like it's top secret, which it most certainly is not, and should not be.

2). WHERE ARE THE VEHICLES?  Don't forget about this because it seems like everybody has/did, the Dev's promised us vehicles IN THE GAME by December 31st, 2012...that was three months ago...where are the vehicles?

3). The ""bug"" fixes...wtf are these?  They are nerfing melee weapons?  Melee weapons were FINE why did they go through the trouble of slowing them down?  The bug fixes are pointless, I personally believe they are biding their time, they don't have anything in the works, and if they did WHY WON'T THEY TELL US?  Right now the community needs something to keep their spirit up, the forum got hacked, our account information got stolen and still there has been no update about this except from the HACKER HIMSELF...is everybody at Hammerpoint DRUNK?

4). Zombies...why aren't they fixing the ""bugs"" with zombies?  They hit faster than you can with 99% of melee weapons in the game, they climb BUILDINGS, walls, towers, they climb OVER BARRICADES (in my experience) and I'm getting tired of it, I have a horde of zombies on my and I jump on top of a tower and they climb UP THROUGH THE SOLID ROOF (Splinter sniper towers), I had a zombie climb up the back wall and the up the entire tower without using the stairs at all...what is going on?  Why aren't they focusing on fixing the bugs that actually ruin the game?

My point is the Dev's aren't doing anything constructive, they aren't keeping the community properly updated with what they are doing and they keep taking out money.

Final point, the marketplace, something needs to be done, there should not be in game cash and GC, these should be fused so that you can find GC/In game cash on zombies and if you choose you can purchase more, items shouldn't be so expensive, 15000 in game cash for a stanag 30 mag?  Seriously?  The marketplace is the dev's most obvious scam, they crank the in game prices so in order to afford anything you need to kill hundreds of zombies and if you want to survive you have to buy mags with GC because THEY AREN'T EVEN FOUND IN THE GAME!!!

That is all I have to say, it saddens me to think that the dev's have given up but it's the most obvious conclusion with all the evidence I've seen and/or been given.

Thoughts?  Conclusions?  Does anybody have any information that would prove the dev's are still active?  I WOULD LOVE TO BE PROVEN WRONG! (Honestly I would, I really enjoy this game...)

TL;DR: The Dev's seem to have left the game, they fix minor, unimportant bugs while the whole game cracks around it, they make promises they don't keep and they have destroyed the game with their nerfing and ""loot spawn"" fixes, and honestly I'm a little tired of their bullshit."	t5_2ujwe	True
1363161599.0	1a7e5q	#1 War Z Newbie Guide	Yazui	32	15	44	"**#1 War Z Newbie Guide by Yazui** (Please note this is guide is for new players seeking information that many players will already know) Also take in mind i'm from Australia and some words are spelled differently in Australia.

**Useful Links to help you!**:

*Detailed Map with loots spawns/weapon spawns*: http://warz.neon-gaming.de/

*War Z Wiki* : http://www.warzwiki.com/The_War_Z_Wiki

**Basic Information**:

There are 2 things in this game that are going to kill you. **Players** and **Zombies**. Both being able to kill you in under seconds. Keep in mind players are very hostile and will if not 90% of the time kill you on sight. Zombies take 4-7+ hits depending on your talent tree spec and specific armour. 4 being the default from 100% health and no armour.

**Maintaining your Hunger and Thirst bar**:

Iv'e never really gone below 50% on either bar since food and water is so easy to find. Just be sure to eat food and drink consumable liquids when they are on 3/4. When scavenging in different areas and you come across a consumable food but you already have one of the same item, Just consume it and then pick up the new item allowing you to keep the item and gain a portion of your hunger/thirst bar instead of just leaving the item there.

**Zombie Aggression Range**:

Noise + Vision being the values that we take in order when dealing with Zombies and also players. Pressing ""ctrl"" will crouch your player lowering your vision to be seen and reducing the sound in which you make. The distance in which you can move around Zombies whilst holding ""ctrl"" is quite close and should be used fairly often when moving about in cities/towns/loot zones. Prone is another feature you can use by pressing ""z"" which places your character on his/her belly allowing you to commando crawl about at minimum vision and noise. Although this isn't used much when handling with zombies it's a great feature to use in Player Vs Player rendering you harder to see.

**Killing your first Zombie**:

When you spawn you'll be spawned with a flashlight (Melee Weapon). Now in this game when you hit a Zombie with a Melee weapon it will stun it for 1 or 2 seconds (unsure of the exact duration) allowing you to stand there and deal full damage killing the zombie without taking a single bit of damage. Flashlight isn't the best Melee weapon and shouldn't be used if you plan on looting cities/towns. Dealing with 2 Zombies is a bit more challenging but here is how it's done. You'll have to hit the first one and stun it then quickly turning to the second Zombie and stunning it as well then turning back to the first zombie. Rinse and repeat. Take in mind and this is my personal preference and stay in third person mode. You can switch between first person and third person by pressing ""c"". Staying in third person allows you to see a lot more of your surroundings and I'd only suggest using first person once you have obtained a gun and using it to aim your iron sights for a head shot.

**Dealing with other Players**:

I tend to stick to smaller servers and for me I try and stay out of Player killing and only shoot if being shot at. The rule of thumb for War Z is to kill or be killed. Every player I have come across who has noticed me has tried to kill me so in saying this if you see someone either kill them or leave the area and look for a new area to loot. Also don't spray your gun like a maniac. Follow them and make sure you don't give them the chance to retaliate. Make sure that your 1 shot is a 1 shot kill.

**Obtaining your first gun!**:

This location i'm about to show you always has lower tier guns like handguns, Rifles, M4's (semi), Melee weapons, Backpacks, Foods etc.
Location is ""Springer Ridge Trailer Park"" and ""Crystal Lake Resort"". I'll break both these down into 2 sections to make it easier for you guys.

**Springer Ridge Trailer Park**:

This area is amazing and it has NO ZOMBIES around and you can search the whole strip in under 3 minutes. Iv'e only ever witnessed 1 other player here. At the start of the strip (starting from the south) there is a Caravan and on the left and right of the strip are houses which you should check. These spawn food, water, masks, barricades, backpacks and some other items which I can't recall. In this area there are 3 Caravans which a high majority of the time spawn your first weapon. In the Caravans iv'e found Wooden bats, .22 Kruger rifle, 9mm Jericho, 1911 Pistol, Double Barrel Shotgun, Tactical Knife. These always spawn at the end of the caravan in the bed area. Make sure to always check the front of the Caravan in the driver and passenger seat since iv'e found some good items. At the end of the strip (North) is a bigger house that spawns the same items as the smaller houses on the side but it has a more spawn points within the house. Take in mind the fridge area in the house is bugged and items are unable to be obtained since they are glitched inside the fridge. This concludes the Springer Ridge Trailer Park loot guide. From here you move down to...

**Crystal Lake Resort**:

From the last house at Springer Ridge Trailer Park I move directly East towards the road heading north into Crystal Lake Resort. This my favorite area and it's where I obtained my first 1,000 Experience due to Zombies being evenly spread from each other . This area has better weapon spawns and better items spawns than Springer Ridge Trailer Park (Majority of the time anyways). So starting from the road you'll first come up against a few Zombies on the road that you will need to clear. Make sure you have a decent Melee weapon. You should be able to pull 1 Zombie each time and make your way through the area. When facing north on your left should be a fuel station, from here if you look north there should be a wooden fence going north. There should be a chapel looking building. It's the only building along the fence. Now this Chapel has spawned all at once: Brass knuckles, .22 Kruger Rifle, 9mm Jericho and a Spiked bat. The building itself has spawned a M4 (Semi) too. From here on you'll want to search the 4 buildings on the side of the chapel then making your way to the post office then the supermarket. Whilst searching these buildings you will want to kill every Zombie you see. You don't want 2 zombies coming after you because it's hard to learn how to deal with 2 zombies at a time if your new. From here there is 2 police cars on the road which you will want to check inside of. Heading south of the the area move towards the lake which there is a Restaurant and 3 or 4 houses (These are on the east). The restaurant spawns Can of soup, Can of Tuna, Can of Pasta and Juice. All in which if consumed will heal a small portion of your Health (a little more on this later). Make sure to watch our for Zombies ""sleeping"" on the ground. DO NOT attempt to hit them whilst they are getting up because with out fail they will hit you once. The rule of thumb for this is swing your weapon which increases the noise and it will wake them. Wait for them to get up and leave space for them to walk 2-3 steps before bashing and beating them to a pulp. From the restaurant move along the shore and check all the houses as they spawn many weapons from Handguns to shotguns and misc items. This now completes the first tutorial of obtaining weapons and experience. be sure to stick around and kill zombies. Once this area has been cleared you can move back up to Springer Ridge as the area would have re spawned new items.

**My backpack is full**:

Press ""M"" and look at your Map. All the areas that have a red circle around them are SAFE zones in which you can go in store your items in a vault. Items stored in the vault cannot be accessed by other players only yourself. The vault can be accessed from any of your 5 characters. So any items you obtain on 1 character can be stored in the vault and be taken out by another character. I suggest using ""Blue Ridge Settlement"" if your looting in Crystal Lake Resort and Springer Ridge Trailer Park. Takes 10-12 minutes (this is an estimation) to travel from Springer Ridge Trailer Park to Blue Ridge Settlement (Safe Zone). In here store all your items except a Melee weapon and some food and water and rinse and repeat.

**My Health is Low, What should I do?**:

Medical supplies are quite scarce and are hard to find without entering a city. From my current knowledge normal Bandages heal 15% of your current heal and the Bandages DX heal 35% (This is the default values this doesn't include the benefits from skill tree). Food items can heal you as well. Though looking through the wiki as I make sure most of this information 100% accurate I couldn't find the specific healing values of the food that heals but I'll list the foods that heal a small amount of Health

* Bag MRE
* Can of Ham
* Can of Soup
* Can of Tuna
* Juice (Liquid)
* Coconut Water
* Electro-Aid

*These all heal a small amount of health (Not sure that it's 100% of the time as some times it hasn't healed anything but whenever I see these i'll pick them up always).*

**Skill Tree**:

This is a good feature which can be accessed from the ""Survivors"" menu upon opening the game. Depending on how you want to spend your skill points I advise by getting these skills first: Increased Health, Increased Melee Damage and Increased healing effects from consumable healing items. Those are the basics which you should obtain first since they help a lot. From here on you can choose which path you want to go down. 

**Final Context**:

Even though this game has a relatively high learning curve it may seem that this game is impossible at first but I assure you it get's so much easier the longer you play. Just practice killing Zombies and sooner or later you'll be able to kill 100+ Zombies without taking a single bit of damage from using a Melee weapon. Keep stocking up your items and storing them in your vault and never take good items when traveling solo. Always team up with friends who you can trust and use your better items when your grouped. If you reading this being a experienced player or new player, I'd like to thank you for reading this and I hope you learned a few things or iv'e reminded you of something in which you have forgotten.

Because of what happened i am now a bandit, i wont go around killing people who have melee weapons or are unarmed, but i WILL kill you if you have a gun out, because chances are, you will kill me. 

Now, when i look on the forums i see alot of rage against bandits have killed a player one way or another, people make it out that player killing is a crime, but 9 times out of ten you WILL kill someone if you have the chance to get better loot, you know why? the urge to survive.

1355582827.0	14w8or	Thoughts on increased zombie spawns	wtfuggShane	26	9	56	"When I first read this in the patch notes I was excited, as I've thought for a while now that the zombies were too easy to deal with and therefore didn't play a large enough role in player strategies in this game. But now that I've actually been inside the world to see it, I've changed my mind.

The increased zombie count seems to work really well at first in a place like Camp Splinter were I believe the chance at higher-tier loot ought to hold more risk, but what I found is that more zombies were spawning and walking into the camp to replace ones I had killed before I had even checked all the item spawns in the area. This meant that I ended up in a situation where I accidentally aggroed 3 zombies and was forced to run but ended up dying because the area I had already cleared was filled back up with zombies again, despite only maybe 5 minutes passing.

Shortly thereafter, I stumbled upon the ruins of an old shack in the woods not marked on the map to west of Smallville. I approached it figuring there was a good chance no one had looted it in a while only to find no items but 14 zombies spawned around it. Now, I feel that I should mention that this shack is about 10x10 feet square, in the middle of nowhere with nothing anywhere near it and that, if we're speaking in terms of lore and setting, would only have comfortably housed 1 hermit. So if I stumbled upon such a shack in the zombie apocalypse, I'd expect to maybe find 2 or 3 zombies *tops*. But this place had 14. It seems that the increased spawns haven't been placed thoughtfully, but rather across the entire map.

I suppose my feeling on this is that I like that the difficulty has gone up, but not the means in which it has gone up. I would much prefer that they introduced more zombie types (i.e. different methods of attacking), such as how they currently have standing zombies, roaming zombies, and zombies that are lying down/playing possum, which I think adds more layers of challenge and strategy to the game. 

I would love to see [normal] zombies of varying speeds, agility, and strength, legless zombies that only crawl (all of which are perhaps affected by existing injuries or decay), zombies with erratic patterns of behavior, zombies that are better/worse at surmounting obstacles (some can climb over fences or climb stairs, some can't) zombies that are more likely to react to what other zombies are doing (like following other zombies and even noticing when another zombie within their line of sight nearby spots a player), etc. Basically meaning that should you aggro more than one zombie, the situation will still be tense but you can take on those zombies using individual strategies (take out the fastest one first, ignore the crawling one, etc) instead of the current way that multiple zombies chasing you just means they clump up into a non-melee-able glob that moves at the same speed, which just isn't fun. As a side note, I would also love to see the boss zombies display outlandish characteristics like the the super infected in Left4Dead do, but that's kind of beside the point.

I would also like to know if anyone else noticed that the zombies seemed to not be dropping money since the patch. I must've killed a hundred or more but didn't see a single money drop (though one did drop a medium backpack). I know the zombie loot spawns are rather erratic, so it was hard to say whether I had just had bad luck or it was a result of the patch. Edit: since realized it was bad luck.

Anyway, I'd love to hear what you guys think about the increased number of zombies and my ideas for zombie behavior. Otherwise, see you in Colorado!"	t5_2ujwe	True

We were fighting three guys that was camping on the third floor. I managed to take out two of them but when the third guy was on his way out of the room my game crashed. If my game hadn't crashed we would have gotten all of them but since I crashed my friend got left alone and killed by the last guy. I was lucky to survive since he did not notice me until I was almost logged out so I survived with 20% hp.

The point of this thread is that I wonder if anyone knows if they are trying to fix this or if they're even aware that this is happening. It has been this way since the whole map was released and it is extremely annoying.

The stand off lasts around 10 minutes before one of them decides to quickly server hop, walk behind me and hop back onto my server. It must have taken a minute if that. He spawns behind me and kills me.

I get to boulder city. Start looting that bit of road with all the cars. I walk all the way to the end. All clear. As I move out somebody spawns behind me and shoots me in the back.

I'm about to run into Echo's compound. As I run past the car some dude spawn right in front of me facing the other way. So I pop him. The compound is all clear. I run upstairs when some dude spawns on the roof of that little shack and kills me. So I decide to sit there and watch for a few minutes. The whole compound was infested with people server hopping for loot. Some of them obviously knew what was happening so they camped in the corner and shot anyone spawning in but then other started spawning in and killing those campers from behind.

I'm in the tower. I run in, check there is nobody around. I hear some noises so I run downstairs. Some dude is agroing in the distance. So I run back up to catch a whole fucking squad spawning in. Fuck that, I run away.

Basically you can never clear an area. You have to watch your back every other second in popular areas. You can't have stand-offs. You have to move around all the time.

One of the solutions would be to check the area you are spawning into and if there are people besides your squad in that area you should be asked to either try again later or have an option to spawn further away. A simple solution to loot hopping would be to make all loot within x meters invisible upon spawning. "	t5_2ujwe	True
1351895937.0	12jdkk	11/02/12 Alpha End Date, Wipe Date &amp; Other Questions Answered [OFFICIAL LINK]	kaelz	24	5	41	"&gt;Hello all!

&gt;I've got some more information for you I wanted to get out there - it's my goal right now to get as many answers for you as possible.

&gt;I'm going through and answering as many questions as I can throughout the day, but we're all very busy over here, so I'll try and answer them in handfuls.

&gt;First - I went through like 10 pages of 'Are we in beta?' 'Whens beta?', 'We're in alpha', 'no we're in beta', etc ad nauseam, so I went and sat down with Sergey. After some thorough discussion I want to clarify some things:

&gt;1. We're currently in Alpha
2. The game is open, so that anyone can purchase and play
3. That being said, we are still in the process of testing and you are our test (pretty hard to beat a 200k test team)
4. Alpha is over when we're happy with the current state of the game (balance, performance, features, etc).

&gt;Given our current workload, we're planning on ending Alpha on November 30th, at which point the wipe will take place.

&gt;For information regarding the wipe, please see my other thread here: http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread...-present-wipe)

&gt;At this time, following the wipe, servers will become available for rental. Now, this includes both FULL and STRONGHOLD servers.

&gt;Right now we're also investigating a number of other topics, with Hackers right near the top of the list. I assure you we are quite aware of the hacking that's out there, and our insanely talented code/community team is tackling each issue as soon as it arises. That being said, I encourage everyone to continue reporting hacking when its spotted, as all the info we can get helps.

&gt;We're also talking about: an offensive name filter, skill trees, server list sorting, new characters/animations (a few are very nearly done), and possible server hopping solutions. I've had a number of great suggestions from you all already, but I wanted to officially let you know that YES we know its a problem, and YES we are discussing solutions. For the things I've just listed however I can't give specifics, but know that its next on my list to have answers for.


&gt;So, I'm sure I don't need to ask but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the November 30th end date to Alpha, and corresponding wipe.

&gt;Thanks for reading, and I'll see you in game!

First off, i was in Laketown, near the downtown shops. I was chased by a few zombies into the back of a nearby pickup, equipped only with my hammer. Down the road, I see another survivor being chased, running towards my truck. He was empty handed. As he runs up to me, i step up to the edge of the truck bed. Brandishing my hammer, i firmly state, ""Trucks taken."" Unsure of what to do, he hesitates a split second. Jump up and die? Or get eaten? He took too long to decide, and they got him.

Next, i was wandering the mean streets of Big City. I had two hammers this day. But i was alone. Oh so alone. It was dark as well. Rounding a corner, i meet another stranger scouting for supplies like i was. ""Friendly?"" He asks. ""Sure!"" I reply. ""Need a hammer?"" I toss my spare to the ground in front of me. As he bends down to grab it, i club his skull in. Free oatmeal packets that day!

Lastly, i was making my way to the walmart super center near Big City. I check inside the nearest house for supplies (i had just spawned) before going into the store. Only item available was a flare. I hear gunshots, and go look out the door. Two skull-mask guys with guns are right across the street, and see me. One starts towards me. I dive back into another room, yelling ""GET BACK IVE GOT A FLARE!"" No dice. Laying down flat in the prone position I scuttle into the open fireplace just as the gunman enters the room. I screamed HO HO HO as he blasted his shotgun into my face.

What are some sweet stories any of you have encountered? Id really like to hear some!"	t5_2ujwe	True

I don't get why ppl would be so upset after only a week of playing about losing their stuff. Play it another month and you ain't gonna care cus of all the nice new loot you've found.

I was so lucky that i found a handgun with 18 shots, almost just as i spawned. It was in a police car in a town. So i logged out because this was the first gun i've ever found. After 10 min. i did the logical thing, logged back in and shot a guy who only had a flashlight. (He looked scary)    
Then i met 2 dudes one of em' had a bat, i decided to trust them.    
But the guy with the bat kept running at me when i turned around.. Sooo i shot him in the face.        
Suddenly, more guys showed up, most of them only had a bat, or nothing. But this one guy had what lookd like a rifle... Sooo i shot him in the face.        
Turned out it was a crossbow. Then out of nowhere i got shot once, didn't die. I got one shot on the guy who was trying to kill me but he won. He also won all the loot (Crossbow, guns, lots of food, bats etc.) he must be happy right now.. Well unless somebody shot him in the face.

1350403647.0	11kq5t	A feature implementation I think would be fitting regarding lakes and water consumption.	Dissidius	22	6	22	"My proposal is that after consuming a found beverage - water or cola, the can/bottle is kept and can be refilled at a lake.

Each collection of water has a different % chance to damage your health depending on how clean the water is upon collection, ranging from ""dirty"" to ""clean"" (middle ground would be things like ""discoloured"" ""cloudy"" etc)

Once collecting water from a lake you can do one of two things: 


* Drink the water and risk damage to your health depending on the cleanliness of the water - dirty water would have a 9/10 chance to damage you, whereas cloudy would be 3/10.
* Use a ""water purification kit"" (scavenged from around the map) which has multiple charges, and once used ""cleans"" the water - removing the risk of damage to health.

I feel this would add a better sense of realism - as opposed to dying of thirst next to a huge lake.

1350380974.0	11kaf4	War Z Impressions	geman220	23	6	44	"I see a lot of people here complaining about different things, and I'm not going to use the ""it's an alpha deal with it"" argument. I'm only going to address my personal experience with the game after about 3 hours. For example I've heard a lot of complaints about the spawning but honestly I was only spawn killed once the whole time, so I can't comment on the spawning issue.

Personally I think the game is pretty good, although certainly not perfect at this time.

Some of the positives:

* Playing on Ultra @ 1080p with no lag / artifacts / etc. 
* Zombie detection of players seems pretty fair, they don't have super human abilities to find you through walls etc 
* Graphics aren't incredible but I'd still say they are very good 
* Inventory system is nicely laid out and intuitive 
* Game launch times / connecting to server are quick 
* HUD is really good shows everything you need and nothing you don't 
* Dedicated global and proximity chat 
* Finding food / water is pretty easy

Some of the negatives 

* Game crashes a lot (this is my biggest concern, in about 3 hours of playing the game crashed about 15 times. Even for an alpha I do find this to be unacceptable) 
* You dehydrate very quickly 
* Flashlights 2 shot players but are useless on zombies 
* Weapon spawns seem very few and far between (this could be due to me not knowing the ""hot spots"", everyone else has already looted them, or they are intentionally lower for alpha) 
* Invisible walls and invisible zombies (is being addressed)

Other things of note 

* The animations are clunky and downright hilarious sometimes, however I don't feel it takes anything away from the game. It will need to be addressed obviously but it doesn't ruin anything. 
* I love that there is a map but I'd like to have some city or landmarks named on the map 
* I don't completely understand why there is a 1 hour wait to respawn. There are 5 slots and you can delete and recreate whenever you want so you don't HAVE to wait an hour. So I don't understand why when I die I can't just hit ""respawn"" and instantly start over instead of going through multiple menus and disconnecting / reconnecting. 
* I had random issues with the chat box activating randomly and stopping my character 
* I miss having a 3rd person view with a ""movable"" camera like in DayZ. When you are running away and wondering if the zombie is behind you it's a nice feature to be able to look over your shoulder like DayZ.

Let me know what you guys think.

EDIT: Sorry for some reason it just submitted as one massive wall of text.  Fixed for formatting.

EDIT 2: I want to also add that you need to keep in mind Day Z is a Mod on top of already vetted infrastructure (ARMA II).  Most of the mechanics already existed it was just a matter of tweaking and adding to get something different.  War Z however, is built from the ground up.  Personally I think, even in it's current state (except the constant crashing), that War Z is less buggy/clunky than Day Z.  ARMA II isn't exactly the most fluid user friendly game to begin with.

1360144157.0	17zq5i	A quick guide on how to play War Z effectively for new players!	iPhoneK1LLA	45	27	24	"Here's a quick guide on how to play effectively in War Z

1) Flashlight - If you're in the woods and it's dark, turn it on by pressing F. If you're near any buildings which are quite densely, turn your flashlight off. Flashlights are easy to see in the dark and when the sun is going down, so make sure you use it wisely. 

2) Whenever walking from A to B, if you have a choice between a pistol and a melee weapon, choose the melee weapon. They're the most useful weapon in the game for killing zombies and not attracting attention to yourself. 

3) Stock up on medical supplies when you can, I normally carry around a minimum of 4 antibiotics and and 4 bandages. Medkits are useful since they restore you to full health, but only use them if you need to! 

4) Don't worry about your thirst and hunger bar too much, it's easy to find food and water in small buildings and supermarkets. 

5) Don't trust thugs who say they're friendly. Thugs get their titles buy killing civilians like you, so try to avoid them when possible. 

6) Avoid highly populated servers. Normally they're filled with hackers with ESP and aimbot. You'll be lucky if you survive for over 20 minutes in a highly populated server with your lack of skills. 

7) Try and find some friends to play with, it's always good to have some buddies who you can rely on in the game. Make sure you know them though, and they're your REAL friends, otherwise you never know when they might turn around and shoot you in the back. Feel free to add me on skype so we can play sometime (Skype: stick_foo). 

8) Only use your sprint when you need to, try to keep a full sprint bar if you can. Use your sprint when you're in the forests or places with very little zombies. Zombies range of finding you is higher when you start sprinting.

9) Set your inventory key to 'T' instead of 'I' (or anything you feel comfortable pressing). This will save your life a few times.

10) With the current weight system, make sure you always have at least a Medium Backpack on.

11) When taking on multiple zombies try and get them all coming from one direction and keep an eye out on what is happening behind you.

12) Try to keep at least one CO-1 Vaccine on you to make sure you're able to cure yourself ASAP.

13) Before entering a town, scope it out with a pair of binoculars for about 2 minutes or so for any signs of survivors. See if the zombies can show you any signs of if someone has been near it recently. Dead zombies usually die on their backs with their legs open like sluts while sleepers are usually face-down on the ground. Also, check to see if there are any lines of zombies leading outside of a town. That's usually a good sign of someone recently being at your location.

14) Holy shit, turn around every once in a while and check your back! I can't tell you how many people I've been able to sneak up behind without them even turning around once.

15) Abuse the hell out of 3rd person. I can not stress that enough. You'll want to use it to check around corners and even in firefights as it will usually give you an advantage of being able to see more since the ironsights are ""Meh"" on a lot of the guns.

16) Play on Low settings. It may look like shit, but it decreases the amount of foliage and gives you an advantage. I've killed a few people who went prone behind a bush they might've had generated on their screen but didn't show on mine due to Low settings.

17) While in third person mode, press Right-Click and Shift at the same time to change the shoulder you look over.

18) Ammo won't be collected automatically if you reload with a few rounds still in mag.

19) Even though your cross-hair is around the corner doesn't mean that the weapon will fire there, you might end up shooting in to a wall.

20) When you crawl on a area that makes a sound when walking on it, it will be silent to you, but not to other players.

21) Eat chocolate-bars right away, they r derischious. no they don't do shit and takes up bag-space.

22) Don't crawl next to a wall, your feet / rucksack / whatever will be sticking out of the wall and people WILL be able to shoot you.

23) Don't think that you are safe during the night, everyone has night-vision!

24) Just heard a sniper? Run.

25) Clearview and Campos have much more PvP (Player verses Player) than other towns/cities. DO NOT go there if you've just started playing War Z

26) If you want to build a good global inventory, go to the closest cities/towns next to safe zones: Smallville or Rocky Ford.

27) Avoid painted lines on concrete, they make noise when walking over them.

28) Don't trust anyone who says they're friendly, 99% of the time, they're not.

29) Patience is key. Sometimes it's best to let the trouble come to you instead of trying to go out and find it ;)

Things to note:
When on some vehicles, zombies CAN glitch on top of the vehicles and swing at your legs.

Just because someone has got to a place you cannot does NOT mean they're hacking.

Not everybody who kills you is automatically a hacker, so please use the report button with respect.

Just some pointers :) Have fun and enjoy the game!

Edit: Keep your tips coming guys, all useful tips will be added to this post!

Obviously, it doesn't represent the entirety of the playerbase, but it does show that there are a large number of people out there who enjoy the game, problems and all. I was among the 50% who claimed that WarZ is good but needs work, so I don't believe it's an amazing game, but I do think it's a damn enjoyable one and so does everyone I  personally know who bought and played the game. Based on that, I have a hard time accepting that all the criticisms being leveled against WarZ are legitimate issues. Either way, I'm not here to make judgments.

But I would be curious to hear what you folks think about the results of the survey. So: discuss away, if you will.

I get there, find an AKM, and rejoice. Then I'm heading to the city when I see two people move towards me. I had only my Five-seven out, so I guess they thought they could over power me. I whip out my AKM and take down each in three shots. They were both armed with weapons though, which was peculiar. I've never felt a rush like I did then, when I gunned down the second guy as he was running away. I couldn't let him escape.

But I think if you just open up the map some more, there would me more place to spread out, which also means there will be less pk'ing, atleast that's my guess. But the fact that there are 30 ppl on such a small part of the map, just makes it inevitable that there is so much pvp/pk'ing.

In WarZ, near the beginning, water drained faster than food, but now it's very much the opposite unless you sprint constantly.

As I'm coming down the west hill I stop at one of the ambulances on the road, answering a text while checking out the streets and seeing if there's anyone around. 
A flashlight beam suddenly engulfed me, (It's the dead of night by the way) I drop my phone and reach for the keyboard+mouse in time and I move out of the way, spinning around as a player barely misses hitting me in the head. 
I make short work of him with my hammer, he drops a shotgun and medical supplies.

Healing up and taking the shotty (that had only one shell left) I work my way into town, going through the houses on my way north.

Suddenly there's a frenzy of activity, flashlight beams waving all around in front of the larger supermarket. (where that APC is surrounded by sandbags.)

In the proximity chat there's tons of commotion as 5 players try to keep each other from attacking one another, the 'leader' of the group becoming one player who's on top of the APC wielding a pistol.

At this point I've made my way along the back of the Post Office, the building on the corner next to the APC, and I make my way over to a Cop car to the west of the intersection as the group spans out into the surrounding buildings looking for loot while the pistoleer keeps watch.

Now, I'm crouched behind the cop car, there's a gas mask on top of it. Sitting there as if it was laid out right side up on purpose. 

The group had found nothing but a cross bow and an empty pistol and were deciding to move south to the city. 
Being the paranoid guy that I am I keep rotating around and around, watching out behind me and keeping an eye on the zombies.

I wasn't interested in joining up with them because such groups doesn't usually end well for them. At one point they move off the APC and towards me, forcing me to keep the Cop Car between us, leading me to discover a Med Kit on the other side. (Huzzah!)

Gunshots ring out from the hills as a player spouts rage in Global about someone trying to kill him. The group all scramble back to the APC leaving me alone in the safety of my Cop car.

Looking behind me to the west and the hill I notice Zombies chasing a player in red flannel (usually the most dastardly of players.) He starts to make his way down towards town, on the northern end. (I can only assume he's gone to check the Sheriff's Station first.

Meanwhile the group is finalizing their plans for the city, (All in proximity chat as they have the whole time.) They make note of the Gas Mask on the car I'm hiding behind, suggesting that one of them go and take it, and that's when all hell breaks loose.

From up the street, coming form the Sheriff's Station, Assault rifle fire begins to ring out, the guy on the APC is taken out immediately, another grabs his pistol and starts to return fire, but it seems he only had 4 shots left and then he goes down. 2 of them make their way into the supermarket as the Bowman crouches on the front end of the APC trying to get some cover while also having a higher vantage point.

By now I'm standing up, using the Gas Mask  to cover my head so I can get a better view. Taking the Gas Mask and putting it on because I was getting ready to make a break for it if they turned their attention towards me.

The rifleman makes his way down, gets shot by the Bowman and then runs up and executes him with 3 shots of a pistol, moving into the supermarket I hear 6 more shots ring out before all grows quiet. He climbs up onto the APC after a while and begins to reload and heal up.

Jumping off he makes his way to the west, right towards me. He had to have heard about the Gas Mask or seen it because he jumped onto the car going up to try to pick it up.

His surprise when he gets to the top of the car only to see a player in a Gas Mask looking up at him, right before I pull the trigger and blasting him point blank with my only ShotGun shell.

I looted his M16 (now empty, and a B92 with 6 shots left, then I booked it into the hills as the sun started to rise.

TL;DR
Pick up everything because you don't know when that Gas Mask on top of that car is just an item or someone who's watching you quietly."	t5_2ujwe	True

Some of you might have heard already that a lot of people have gotten banned lately, especially with the recent ban-waves. However, many of us (I am one amongst them) do not know the reason of WHY we got banned.
I got both hacker/legit friends who got banned with no reason stated, desperately trying to contact support.
The WarZ-forums got flooded with messages, at some point players couldn't even open any more threads. Mailing the support won't resolve our problem since they publicly said that those bans are final, with a 99% accurate human check rate, and they will not handle any related requests.
Are you one of those players that has gotten banned, tried to contact support but they have let you stranded? Please read further.

**What leaves it for us then?**

Simple. They are failing us to bring us a working product. Since we all have paid via Paypal, we can demand our money back with the above stated reason. As long that they don't have the adequate proof shown to us, we have the right to get our money back. 
It doesn't matter what the arguments are at the moment; Person A (devs) ban us for hacking, Person B (banned ppl) say that they lie and they got no proof.


**Getting money back via Paypal:**

* Just go to www.paypal.com and log-in to your account.
* Go to [My account] and click on complaints centre.
* Select 'Dispute a transaction' and click on 'dispute over object' (I did not recieve a bought object)

 Remember, they failed us to bring a working product because we got banned for no reason/without proof.
Follow the steps accordingly and eventually with the help of Paypal you'll get your money back.


**What will be happening next?**

As the developers stated on the WarZ-forums about the numbers of people that got banned, there are a few options left.

* First: They do nothing. This would result in all the players banned would have their money refunded. Keep in mind that Paypal is aware of this, conducting his own research, eventually turn it into a legal case.

* Second: They would adequately suffice us from enough information regarding the ban. They would probably have to hire in a billing and account support team.
* Third: Some would get their money refunded, some would have their bans proven. Bear in mind that the results of this question matters. If this would turn out to be a scandal, who knows what will become of the game? For now we can only speculate.
* Four: They decide to unban the accounts. We could say we are all happy now, but this would affect the public image of the War Inc-company."	t5_2ujwe	True
1355070666.0	14jva6	Met a friendly in War Z	Cloud1227	33	18	32	The hard part of this game is meeting someone who at first glance won't put a clip into you. I have died while carrying only a small bag and I will admit I have done the same. Without a way to communicate it is hard to trust someone new for the first time. Anyway I spawned after dying with only a bottle of water when I ran into someone. After shouting friendly he actually offered me a few items than stay quiet or try to kill me. Seems he had no weapons as well and handed me a large back pack. This was shocking to me since I like to stock pile back packs in case I die so I don't use a small back pack. After walking a bit the moment of truth comes. We find an m4 on the floor. I have him take it since he did hand me the back pack and fully expected a shot to the face. He actually continue to help me find a few more items before logging out. TL;DR Met someone new and rather than just kill each other we worked together.	t5_2ujwe	True
1355035023.0	14jdn6	Its all going out of control of the communtiy	Spartan9365	36	22	30	"With the last few patches, and hot-fixes the game is losing the bit of cool it had for me at the start. I loved it as a great alternative to DayZ, my group of friends won't even touch DayZ anymore after some bug related problems. But this game is starting to seem worse the even with DayZ bugging, unbalanced, crazy game play. And now it is getting to the point that you can't even say anything about it on the game forums without serious backlash. 

Don't get me wrong I really want this game to succeed, but if they can't work on the major problem instead of adding a bunch of new noises to distract me in a firefight, I don't know how much I want to do with this game. Once upon a time you were able to submit a bug report after game play and they took that feature away at the start of ""alpha 2"". Hacking has yet to see a true major address. And major features are still lacking. 

And before you go all ""THIS IS AN ALPHA HOW DARE YOU!!!!"" ape shit on me, just listen to reason, think really long and hard. Yes the game has improved for since alpha 1 launch. Yes we see minor improvements, but are you not tired of these devs making mountains out of mole hill?  Are you not tired of being batted down every time you speak out against a new ""improvement"" that is ruining game play (talking about population on the servers there).  

I guess the point I am getting at here is: Am I the only one that feels like these devs are only pretending to listen to our pleas? Or that they are just doing their own thing, and trying to make us play War Inc."	t5_2ujwe	True

1351542547.0	12an6e	How to loot items off the top shelf by yourself!	brandxnewx13	25	10	13	"So I was playing around with ways to get some items off the top shelf in grocery stores/pawn shops and I finally figured out the best way by yourself.

First make sure you have room in your inventory for the item you want (duh).

Next make sure the item is resting on the top shelf, not hovering above it. Also, items in the top shelf cubbies in post offices won't work with this method.

Third, stand directly in front of the item you want on the top shelf and drop anything from your inventory. If you have nothing on you, find something you can pick up and drop.

Now here's the hard part. Look down at the item you dropped and hold E to pick it up. Wait until the circle is almost completely filled and then jump and look at the item you want on the top shelf. If done correctly, the circle will continue from the point it was on the floor item and finish on the top shelf item. It will take a few tries but I have mastered this already. Thanks to this, I have found a couple backpacks and some body armor on top shelves this past weekend.

Hopefully this will be fixed soon, but in the meantime, don't miss out on any good loot!

Hope this helps a lot of you survivors until they patch it!

1351488443.0	129fhp	My Awesome Bandit Experience	Rythmn	21	4	12	"So I'm rolling with 3 of my friends (Which makes us a group of 4). We're rolling through the big city in the middle and are held up inside one of the apartment buildings just watching the city for anything moving. Off in the distance, near the BIG Mart building, we spot another group of 4 and they looked armed to the tee.
 
Feeling a sense of adrenaline we all decide to go out armed with our assault rifles and engage them as quickly as possible. Sprinting down the road carelessly of anyone who spots us, we ran to the mart window and listened for footsteps, silent. 

Couple of seconds later, we decide to try and bum-rush the mart... empty. We're all super confused and like wtf? lol. Being a bit depressed we didn't get to fight them, we start heading back to our original location, inside of one of the apartments. 

On the way back, we're talking about random stuff when all of a sudden Pulsiv (The buddy in the front of us) spots a survivor RIGHT next to him behind a chain-link fence. Gunshots go off but the guy manages to run inside the building which is RIGHT nearby. Without coming up with a plan, they decide to go around the front (My 3 buddies) and I ended up going through the back. BOOM I hear a couple of shots from one of my friends in the front, ""I got one, he was coming out the front door.."" So I continued to end up finding another armed survivor in the corner of the building as soon as I enter the back door. Without hesitation, BOOM he goes down with a couple of shots from my M4. Without thinking for some reason, I decided to sprint into the building to check the loot only to find ANOTHER armed survivor in the other corner and pelting me with bullets. I quickly turn around and sprint back out the back door screamin, ""There's 1 more in the corner!"". About a second later, I hear another BOOM as my 3 friends who entered from the front storm the building and drop the last armed survivor. The amount of adrenaline we had was crazy when you're in a situation like this, I love it.

We all walk into the building saying, ""Alright, lets loot'em boys!"" and see LOADS and LOADS of loot to pick up. We find 3 kobra's, 2 silencers, 2 foregrips and ammo (Not counting how many guns they had on them). Other than the weapons they had, we also found large backpacks followed with 3 body armor's.

I'm lovin this game too much already..

""Oh great there is a sniper in town"" so i keep a low profile and soon after i spot 2 well armed men (rifle, gun and armor). I really dont wanna mess with those guys since I only have a hammer so i run behind the supermarket where you can jump the container and get over the fence.

 as i am about to jump I spot a 3. guy, he stops at the fence and appears to disconnect so i seize the chance, jump the fence and smashes his brains out....

I quickly grap his shotgun and pistol and proceed to switch my backpack with his and stock up on supplies. Then I hear footsteps from the side of the fence where i started ""Oh sh¤¤"" .first person mode and look up, there is a guy jumping at the very same moment, I quickly blast him and his friend appers at the edge of the fence at the same time so I kill him too...

If you do attract a zombie DO NOT sprint! Wait for it to get close and when it goes to swing at you back away. It will miss every time. As soon as it misses walk towards the zombie and simply strafe circles around the zombie while bashing it in the head with a flashlight or other device.

**Where will i download the game?**

You will download the client from http://thewarz.com/download.html and it will be roughly 5 mb in size. Once downloaded, you will use the serial number and email that was used to buy the account to verify and then register a new email (or the same if you wish). From that client you will install a launcher and download/install the game

**When can i download the game?**

You can begin downloading the client October 15th, 2012 mid-afternoon PST

**How large is the actual game?**

The game is roughly 2-3gb FOR ALPHA. in the beginning we are limited to ~30% of the map. we will get to explore more of the map aas the alpha goes on.. and we are expected the full map when beta is launched. so actually the full game is between 6-9gb.

**How long will it take to download the game on launch day?**

It will take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on your download speed and how many people are downloading

**Will there be an NDA?**

YES YES YES!!! the NDA (or non-disclosure-agreement) will start October 15th and end sometime in the first week or 2 in November

**What is a NDA?**

A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement, is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects nonpublic business information.

**When will I be signing this NDA?**

You will more than likely sign/agree to it after installing the client or when you first run the game, if you dont accept it you will NOT be able to play

**Will I be able to rent a server or stronghold during alpha?**

NO, this time period is for testing the game on a larger scale.. as such the game will be very strict and will loosen up during beta/retail

**Will loot be different during alpha?**

YES.. spawn rates will be slightly increased in order to allowed more testing of weapons/items 

**What will we spawn will during alpha?**

We will start out with water, food, bandages, a flashlight, and your map.. although since it is alpha it is more than likely that they will adjust these

**Will there be a wipe after alpha (oct 30&gt;31) or not?**

No

**Why are we limited in the map during launch?!!??**

we are limited so we dont aimlessly wander around exploring, we are limited to test loot spawns and AI and various other things

thats all i can think of for now but if you can think of more good questions for launch day feel free to post them and ill add them when/if we have an official answer

However it has taught me to trust no one. The first time I spawned in I found a .22 rifle and pistol pretty close to spawn. I then teamed up with some guys I met in a city and when we were running through a town I found a Saiga, apparently they wanted it, so one of them put a bullet in the back of my head while I was in my inventory. It was then that I got... dark. Once my character was able to respawn I joined a random server and the first thing I see is another player, he seemed to be a new player like me. We ended up teaming up and ran into a small farm near by where he found a flare gun, and I found some food. Obviously by running through the farm we got some attention by Zombies, but we quickly lost them. We then ran into a town and the first house I went into I found a .22 and a saiga, let's just say I was happy. He and I also both found a bat each along with some food. We were about to run into a store to loot it when he asked me for my .22 and when I said no he seemed pretty okay with it because it was likely we would find another gun soon. So we proceed into the store where I find another pistol, I was going to give it to him until I remembered my last alliance, and how it ended, so I didn't tell him about the pistol and instead I dropped it back on the ground and called him in, when he saw the pistol he ran over to it and picked it up. Then when he turned around I blasted him in the face with my Saiga and picked up all his loot. The guilt I felt just afterwords was the worst I had felt in my entire life. But I had to remember, this was a game of survival, I couldn't let it get to me. Please share you stories of betrayal in the comments, and thank you for reading.	t5_2ujwe	True

1364614014.0	1ba8vx	1/3rd of all players are ESPing.		30	15	25	"All 5 of my characters are at the airport at the moment looting. I positioned them around the airport so that if one gets killed I can hop onto the other one and hunt down the killer. I play on the same server usually and have friendly rivalry with a few regulars. Sometimes they kill me, sometimes I kill them. However as soon as I started playing this 5 character setup I would usually just get destroyed. I would lose one character, hop onto the other one and get killed again by the same guy, hop onto the 3rd character and get killed again. At first I thought I was getting outflanked but then I was killed while AFK between remote rocks so I decided to experiment. I went ahead and installed an ESP to see exactly what was going on. I did some server hopping today and it turns out at least a third of all players I've encountered use it.

How can I tell? Easy. I spawn as one character and some people start aiming at me from 300m away and run to flank me. I spawn as another character on the other side and they instantly turn around and start running the other way. You would walk behind the hanger from 100m away and the ESPer inside takes defensive position one one side, you walk back and he moves back. You do that 5 or 10 times and there is no doubt. You can see them just staring at you through buildings and terrain. Some try to fight you, other run away and log.

I did 20 server hops today and encountered 23 people. 8 confirmed ESPers. No wonder I keep on getting killed with multiple characters like that.

By the way, I just observed. I did not go PVPing with my ESP. In fact, I think I'm done with this game."	t5_2ujwe	True

I got close enough to use my shotgun when one turned around and said ""Don't shoot, we're friendly."" I saw they didn't have anything on them, just small backpacks and hammers, so I decided not to. They told me all they had was a hammer, so I asked them to follow me while we raided a few towns and met up with one of their friends in smallville. They told me they had a stream, but I didn't pay any attention to it at first. We worked our way to Campos, I gave them backpacks and a pistol I found, and they were pretty quiet most the time. We got to campos and started looting, shorty after all of us were sniped. I checked out their stream and was astonished that there was twelve-thousand viewers watching us play this game, and it was for a charity child's play.

Rayneworks	39	25	29	"I've seen a number of posts he's made that for some reason have been upvoted, likely by his own alt accounts. The lack of reason and knowledge in said posts lead me to go through his history to see where he hails from. As one might guess, he was also a regular poster in /r/DayZ, as well as /r/DotA2, which may give you some insight to the type of ""community"" he's at home with. He also has referred to HALO 4 as a ""Cashgrab"", he seems to like that word, so there's another point about how unknowledgeable he is about game development. 

Since War Z was announced, he came here and started spouting uninformed speculative garbage about the game. A few of the worse ones were saying you could buy NVGs with real money, as well as guns and ammunition (Which you can, at the moment, but that is going to go away once the game launches). Every time the developers proved him wrong, he just started spitting out more nonsense.

The truth is, the developers have done EVERY, SINGLE, GODDAMN, THING, the community has asked of them. Nerf melee damage, stronger zombies, more loot, less zombie range, more playable characters, force grass, fixed hundreds of glitches on our request, and many other improvements / tweaks.

This is the TRUTH. We have SEEN IT HAPPEN. This is not speculation, this is not assumption. They are listening to us, and they are fixing everything we ask them to. They are not EA, they are not Valve, they are a small group of dedicated and passionate developers, and they do not have the power to simply STOP HACKING the second they wish to. It will take time, but eventually they WILL put a stop to it one way or the other.

We'll get vehicles, we'll get special infected, we'll get NPCs, and we'll eventually get the game that we paid for.

My advice: Either ban Realister or publicly mark him as a liar and a troll.

It is true that the developers were shady with information before release, but we have seen first-hand that they listen to the community and just want us to enjoy their game. It doesn't matter what you THINK they're like, truth is not a democracy and we have seen NOTHING to prove that they want anything but the best out of their game. "	t5_2ujwe	True

Sure, 3 hits to the head will kill, but with the way zombies dance around after every hit it's next to impossible to actually triple-tat them. And that's just one. Now Zombies have enormous attack ranges -- my very first load into the game post-patch, I died to the second zombie I ran into because he somehow managed to hit me from literally 10 feet away.

You won't run into much people, you can explore and salvage as much as you want with some precautions, global chat is more or less civilized because there is only that many people, and most of all it seems that people are less willing to PK and more shocked at another human when you do come across one.

I for one hope that while it is possible to cram 200 or 250 people in a server, that the developers try to actually keep it on the low end so that there is a feeling of desolation and post-apoloypse.

1350853274.0	11uzog	My Latest Experience (Long Story!)	OneSullenBrit	19	4	2	"I woke this morning, after a terrible night of moaning and gunshots. Grumbling about lack of food, water or even a torch, I checked the map by the light of the rising sun, and noticed I was close to a small town, more like a village. Determined not to rush things, I tried to make my way around the edge of the rise I was on, but soon realised that there was a large cliff running around the edge. I had already spent too long in the area, so I cautiously headed towards the town.

I skirted the edge of the town, past a rock pile, and came into and area with prefab hut. I managed to avoid some of those poor undead bastards, and checked a nearby building, finding some Antibiotics. Pills in hand, I headed towards the centre of the town.

About halfway to the centre, I saw movement behind a building too fast to be zombies. Although it didn't look like they had anything, I wasn't going to risk them seeing me, so I dived behind a burnt out car and watched them move about. They didn't seem to be hiding, but they could just be desperate survivors with nothing to lose. After they had passed, I was debating whether I should just give up on the town, when I heard a call nearby:

""Anyone friendly in town?""

I froze immediately. ""This can't be good"" I thought. When has anyone ever asked that and meant it? It must be a trap! That settles it, I'm out of here. Then suddenly, cries of:

""Yes I'm, friendly""
""Want to team up?""
""Come to the APC in the middle of town"". 

The cry was answered by a couple of people. Intrigued, I edged closer, only to be greeted by the sight 2 players, brazenly standing on the sandbags in the centre of town. I watched for a few seconds, waiting for a hammer wielding psycho or a snipers bullet, but none came. Interest now well and truly piqued, I headed towards them. What have I got to lose?

As I neared them, they asked once again if for any friendly people to join them, and I called out that I would like to join. One of the survivors had a red mask on, but nothing else that I could see, the other player had the plaid shirt on his back and nothing more. ""Safety in numbers"" was probably the last thought on my mind, after ""lots of people to kill me"" and ""this is still going to be a trap"", but I stuck with them. A quick check of the market nearby yielded nothing, but when I came out I saw another 3 people had joined us. One of them suggested going to the city, and as nobody had any objections, we headed off.

We were almost undone as soon as we left the town, being beset by at least 6 zombies. But some quick footwork and a bit of luck had us nearing the outskirts of the city. Plaid-shirt offered to guide us through the city, and as I had never been there before, I had no objections.

We soon discovered that we were quite alone in the city, giving us free reign to loot. All of us had some form of headgear, so we could tell who was who at a distance, and everyone had hammers. There were a few hairy moments with lack of food, but we managed to survive from one granola bar to the next. I got lucky and found a can of soup, a foregrip attachment, and a mask. 

Things were going well, and we were getting cocky. At first we stuck close together, but the desperation for food has us spreading out, trying to grab what we could before we starved. I was with red-mask and plaid-shirt when we hear a cry from nearby. It was muffled due to the distance and the echo from the tall buildings, but it sounded like profanity and accusations. We were to assume things were getting nasty in the need for food. Looking back, I wish that was the reason.

In our meandering from building to building, we came across a large brick apartment complex. As we started in, things looked good. Although there was not a lot of useful supplies, there were plenty of places to look. After clearing out the building, we discovered it must have been used as some kind of milliner's storage, as we each ended up with multiple hats. We went exploring a little more, but then make back for the brick building. That was when disaster struck.

As we entered, I went to the left, into a room. On a top shelf I spied a large rucksack. It was quite high, so I stood precariously on a table to reach it. Taking it down and strapping it on, I was about to call out to the others, when *BANG*, a loud gunshot! I stood frozen in the doorway, the body of plaid-shirt laying halfway up the stairs with a bullethole in his chest. ""Bandit"" he croaked, as the light faded from his eyes. And then I saw him - this subhuman scum stalking up the stairs, not even stopping to check the body of plaid-shirt, intent only on murder. I backed into the room, trying to devise a plan, when another 2 shots *BLAM BLAM*. A cry, cut short told me all I needed to know - red-mask was down. I was alone, in a building, with a gun-wielding psychopath! I didn't know what else to do, so... I ran. I bolted out the front door and ran behind a building. I peered around the corner, checking the windows for movement, but I saw none. The place was eerily quiet, as if even the zombies had stopped to watch the excitement. It was too much for me though, and I decided to head out of the city and find somewhere to hunker down. I turned from the building, and headed across the road, intending to make for the relative safety of the tree line. But then I spotted some buildings. I couldn't hear any movement, and I was desperate for food, so I thought it was worth the risk. I slowly made my way there, and entered an old building, abandoned long before the outbreak. I jumped a counted, and that's when I spotted it - a shotgun! Just laying on the floor, 8 round ready to go. I picked it up and gave it the once over. This thing had never been used, not a scuff or scrap on it. Knowing I was now armed made me even more paranoid though, as I was now a target for even the most carefree of bandits. I headed towards a diner at a crawl, checking the cars along the way. I was just creeping around a bonnet when a horrible moan came from the other side of the car - a zombie, and it had spotted me!

Throwing all caution to the wind I sprinted for the diner, the zombie hot on my heels. I jumped onto the counter, luckily high enough that the zombie couldn't reach, and prepared to bash his brains out with my hammer. I turned towards him, and spotted a pistol on the floor! I had to have it! But there was the problem of our groaning friend to deal with first. I tried to brain him with my hammer, but couldn't get a good swing in without him reaching me. There was nothing for it - I whipped out the shotgun and painted the walls in rotting brain matter. I hopped down from the counter and bent over to pick up the pistol, when a shot rings out! I immediately throw myself to the ground, and desperately look around for someone. Staying hunkered down for what seems like an age, I trainer my shotgun on the nearby windows, but nobody come through, and no more shots are fired. I slowly raise myself up, and peer through the windows, ready to get down quickly, but there is nothing. Deciding to make a break for it, I jump up, launch myself through a side window, and make a beeline for the nearby trees. And with that, I put my city behind me, vowing never to return!

* Download pbsetup from the EvenBalance people at http://www.evenbalance.com/?page=pbsetup.php

* Run pbsetup.exe and click 'Add a Game', pointing it to '*Steam Directory*\SteamApps\common\The War Z\pb'
**It is important you point to the pb directory and not the WarZ directory. You will get an htm\md5 checksum error if you do.**

* Click 'Check for Updates', this should take around 30 seconds to a minute to complete. Make sure WarZ is not running while you do this. If you receive any errors delete the pb folder and run WarZ again to re-create it. You'll then need to start over at Step 1.

* You'll now have a '*Steam Directory*\SteamApps\common\The War Z\pb\pb' folder; copy everything in that folder to the '*Steam Directory*\SteamApps\common\The War Z\pb folder' and say yes to overwriting.

The bottom line here is that we love our community, and you are all a very important part of the development process. Your feedback and testing is helping us to put together the best possible game we can.

Now, to some of your questions.

The wipe:
- We will be wiping all inventories
- We will be resetting player's reputations
- We will also reset all gold coins. Any you received through purchase of a package WILL be given back to you (so you will lose nothing you paid for)
- We will be resetting all characters stats
- We do not, however, have a final date. I assure you this is something at the forefront of my mind, and as soon as we get it settled I will let you all know

Item Spawns
There have also been some complaints about item spawns (ie food doesn't spawn often enough, too many weapons spawn in certain areas, no weapons in others). I'll be sweeping the map confirming a proper distribution of item spawns in the coming days to mitigate any issue there. 

Also, hats! So many damn hats!  To fix the issue of hats taking up item spawns, we'll be implementing a fix that causes spawned items to despawn after a certain amount of time, freeing up those slots.

PvP vs PvE
There's been a number of discussions about PvP and PvE. When Stronghold servers are up and running (and we'll have a bunch of smaller super sexy maps for you as well) these can be password protected, so you can run your server as you like.

Social
Clans are in active development and will be done next week. These will add a clan tag to the users name, and members of a clan will be able to see clan mates in game by an icon over their heads.

Friends! Friends list, join game with friends, and seeing your friends in game is next in the queue after Clans.

I hope that clears up a few things- a big part of my time will be spent with the community, figuring out the big issues and keeping an open line of communication with you about progress on the items you are most concerned about. You'll also see survey's popping up on Facebook, here, and when exiting the game. Please please PLEASE answer these, as they really help us out.

Thats it for now - I'll see you in game!"	t5_2ujwe	True
1352566147.0	12yv04	A friendly encounter at the airfield.	feldopropane	20	8	6	"So my buddy and i are just roaming around Camp splinter, when i start chatting with somebody in global.
The guy is asking about the airfield and what kind of loot can be found there.
So i have a pleasant little chat  with him and my buddy and me decide to make our way to the airfield.

I suggest to my buddy that we go meet with the guy, my buddy being very skeptical at first agrees, so we make our way to the airfield.

We approach from the north and i ask if he's still there, he is.
I tell my buddy to hold on to my gear just to be safe, i keep a pistol some bandages a hammer and some water.
So my buddy moves to his over-watch position my buddy spots him at the parking lot.(it's starting to get dark)
As i move in closer i tell him that i'm walking towards him, he spots me.

We have another chat and, we feel That we can trust him, i give him some advice on how to kill zombies faster and give him some binoculars.
As we move away from the airfield.(with my buddy still covering us or so i tought) somebody approaches us from our rear, with no safe way of letting him know some one is danger close, i just tell him to watch his rear and drop to the floor.

As i tell him that in proximity chat, They start lighting us up with a pistol and a m4 semi, me still with just my pistol with only 9 rounds and  my buddy on over watch doesn't have a clear shot.

So i start pumping lead into one guy i take one out, shit only 4 rounds left, have to make them count as i try my best to get him my aim was not good enough, i didn't drop him shit.
 
Have to think quick, i equip my hammer and flank him, luckily he doesn't spot me sneak up behind him and hammer his fucking face.

And that's my first ""friendly"" encounter at the airfield.
I gave most of the loot to the guy i just met, because i felt like he needed it more than i did.

All in all it was a good experience, and don't forget never let your guard down!

1350668247.0	11r9ql	A Story to Share: My Incredible Experience with War Z PvP	wtfuggShane	19	8	10	"Last night I had a run-in with a string of bandits-- PKers, whatever you want to call them --that resulted in what is easily one of my top ten gaming moments ever.

I have no proof to offer; I was not recording at the time, and even if I had been, it would be a breach of NDA. So you'll have to take my word for it and, if nothing else, I hope it provides some entertainment.

A friend of mine and I were exploring the small town a little ways south of the NW safe zone, looking for any supplies that we could find, whether for sustenance or defense.

Through a small gap in between two fences we spot two players running by, unaware of our presence. My friend and I circle around the edge of the fence to scope out the players and see what we're dealing with. Now, I won't lie, my friend and I aren't above killing other players if we feel there is some benefit in it for us, but we don't do so needlessly nor do we camp unarmed new-spawns.

Minutes before I had just lost my one primary weapon-- a Saiga --trying to reach the safe zone to deposit some gear, so I only had a hammer for protection. My friend had a crossbow with one bolt. So I suppose you could say we weren't well-armed. 

[Disclaimer: for the sake of storytelling, some of the details to follow were gleaned from the aftermath of what happened-- shots left in mags and the like. I had no idea precisely what weapons I was up against at the time.]

Nevertheless, my friend and I crept up on these players, saw that they both had some mean looking weapons, an M107 and SCAR to be precise, and quickly started to back away, but not before we were spotted. We sprinted around a corner and stopped in an alley to see if we were being chased, which we were.

My friend immediately let loose with his crossbow at which point he learned that crossbows in this game are horribly inaccurate, as the shot went about five feet wide of his target. The player with the SCAR opened up on my friend and dropped him immediately.

I stood there for a moment in shock, unsure of what to do with my hammer (if it was an option, I probably would have thrown it at them in panic). As if in slow motion, I saw the SCAR-wielder turning his sights towards me just as his friend with the M107 (who had yet to fire a shot) ran directly into his line of fire, taking the last of the SCAR's three bullets to back of the head and saving me from death.

I saw this as my chance and immediately began sprinting towards the SCAR-wielder to cover the 20 or so feet between us, expecting at any moment to be dropped. I had no idea at the time that he was out of ammunition and had desperately picked up his dead comrade's M107 in the hopes of stopping me, but did not make the switch in time to stop my hammer caving in his skull.

At this point my friend was incredulously yelling at me over Mumble, ""You lived? You killed them? How?""

""With my hammer and their own bullets."" I felt a bit like Tyreese for you Walking Dead comic fans out there.

It turns out that the enemy players' luck with loot only went as far as the guns they had found, as the only other item of note they had was a medium backpack. Which I equipped, stuffed the empty SCAR and Crossbow inside, and grabbed the M107 for myself, which only had 4 shots left, along with some assorted essentials.

At this point, I knew I had to get back to the safe zone to store the SCAR and give my friend his crossbow back. So rather than taking the direct route (and therefore the more dangerous one), I headed west towards the edge of the map and what I hoped was safety. I was wrong.

Not fifty yards out of town I crested a hill and spot 4 players below me about a hundred or so feet away, all carrying guns. I notice them spot me as well and start making a beeline towards my position. Again, I feel a surge of panic, but, upon realizing that my only option is to fight, I duck behind the hill.

As they near the crest of the hill the player in front exposed the barrel of a Saiga and his helmeted dome which I splatter with the M107. I think the sheer loudness of the .50cal sniper rifle shocked us all, as it caused both myself and the two other visible enemy players to stand still for a couple moments longer than we probably should have.

Once I regained my composure, I began to backpedal, aiming down the scope of my rifle, which I discovered at this range was a bit too close for effective aiming, but with without crosshairs otherwise, I had no choice but to make do. Both of the enemy players began to unload on me, but seeing as how one had a Saiga, the other a Jericho, and both had bad aim (and myself being under Lady Luck's blessing that night), never managed to even scratch me. I let loose my second shot, hitting one of the players centermass and dropping him. 

The last remaining visible player starts weaving at this point trying to close the gap between us and causes me to miss my next shot. My fourth-- and last --bullet drops him.

The fourth enemy player who had up until this point failed to show himself finally crests the hill and starts shooting his Mossberg at me. With my M107 out of ammo, and with the knowledge of how effective a hammer charge can be, I begin sprinting towards him, somehow dodging all 3 of his shots. He drops with a bloody and deadly concussion.

Practically breathless and shaking in real-life, I survey my surroundings and the blue-tinted loot pile all around me and see a fifth player I hadn't noticed before. I have no idea whether he was part of their group or just some unfortunate player who was attracted by the gunfire, but he was picking up one of the Saigas (which, fortunately for me, turned out to be empty) so I rushed him too with my hammer, at which point his morale broke and he took off in the opposite direction. For some reason, though, he soon decided to check behind him to see if I was still following, and I dropped my hammer on him.

I picked up the empty Saiga, trudged back to the battlefield of of my flawless victory (yes, never once during all this did I catch a bullet) and collected all the spoils I could carry, including a Custom Guerilla armor vest (only the other Saiga had any bullets left in it, as the player carrying the full Saiga was the first to die).

Being so amped up on adrenaline and nervous about losing my loot, the remaining trek to the safe zone with the loaded Saiga in my hands made me feel like I had to puke. It was uneventful, though, and I safely made it back to deposit my hoard of guns.

I don't blame you if find all this hard to believe, but I assure you that it happened. Regardless of the value of my word, I thought it would be a story worth sharing and I hope it made for an exciting read. If you have any questions about further details, feel free to ask and I shall provide.

TLDR: I more or less solo-killed 6.5 players who tried to jump me. Three of the kills were achieved with a hammer against gun-armed players. One of my favorite gaming moments ever and one that earned me a healthy amount of respect from my gamer friends."	t5_2ujwe	True

In JohnnyTruant's AMA, he did confirm that the Alpha Zombies are currently IN-GAME.
HammerPoint posted a Facebook status congratulating the first player to kill an Alpha Zombie, but provided no proof, and investigation done by the community proved that the player never existed.
JohnnyTruant said that the Alpha Zombies only appear for a very short period of time during the night, and provided no clues as to where they may appear.

I started this thread so that we can find the Alpha Zombies.  We don't know where they spawn, but based on rumors some of the likely areas are the Hidden Forest, and the area around Rifle Ridge.  I say we scour the map with friends to look for these zombies.  I will be updating this post as more information becomes apparent.  I have PM'd the Devs asking for more information, and I am waiting for responses.  Until then, we must organize a search to find the Alpha Zombies.

EDIT 1:  JohnnyTruant also stated that certain notes will give clues as to the Alpha Zombies' locations, but that they are not in game yet. 

EDIT 2:  Jezerr believes he may have had an encounter with an Alpha Zombie in the new area of the map, in between Frosty Pines and Norad Military Base, but closer to Frosty Pines.  Regrettably, he had no weapons and was not recording.  Be sure to check the area out if you are close, and upvote this post so others can see.

http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?43240-!!!-Zero-tolerance-for-spawn-killers-okay-with-pvp (source)

&gt;Here's why - our game set in a harsh world. Not the best place to live. Yet interesting place to SURVIVE. PVP is a natural part of this process. Yes it needs to be balanced, but it needs to be balanced using in game mechanics, not artificial restrictions. Ban Bandits from safe settlements, allow them only to use bandits ""safe settlements"".

&gt;Spawn campers are another story. They sole existence is based on exploting game mechanic - and this is NOT COOL. So we'll deal with those guys with prejudice.

&gt;It may not happen TODAY, but guys - we're working on system that will allow us to punish those people. We're not going BAN them, but we'll make their game playing experience pretty miserable.

I think this is stupid. Why would he punish someone who is spawnkilling when should fix the way spawning works? ""They sole existence is based on exploting game mechanic"" how are people exploiting it, if you can exploit something that means that there is a problem in the mechanic right? why punish the people who spawn kill, instead of fixing the mechanic.

EDIT: Oh and he closed the forum thread because there was too much bashing going on.

These are just my thoughts, you cant punish someone in an alpha for spawn killing because the spawn system is broken.

After finding out where the helicopter crash was, I was sure to get a gun. With a lucky spawn I was only about 100m away from it. In the darkness of the night, I got closer and I saw a silhouette of a person running away from the crash site. I figured I would kill him to see what loot he had gotten from the awesome helicopter crash.

As I got closer a shot rang out, only a few feet from me. One of the loudest gunshots I have heard yet. Not a second later I heard a zombie rawr. One of the coolest and scariest sounds I have heard in this game. A moment later I was dead, and the thing is I didn't really care I had died. That moment showed me what potential this game has to immersing players into the survival aspect of the game and making zombies scarier than ever.

Thanks Warz for that epic moment.

NOTE: I did purchase my game via xsolla paypal.

1. When I had to type what I was inferring about, I typed a general ""requesting a refund for the war z.""

2. It may take some time for a rep to respond. I noticed that during other attempts that if there is no activity for awhile, the chat will time out. Before and during the chat, I made sure to always make sure the window was active just by typing something every other minute or so.

3. When the rep asks why you are requesting a refund, I responded with ""the game lacks many features that were promised by a certain date, and the game is incredibly unplayable due to low fps and intake crashes, etc""

This is where it might get a-little iffy.

4. If they tell you that they can't process the refund because its past 45 days, inform them that ""PayPal says the opposite"" (it may be a lie, but they have lied to us multiple times.) inform them that it is illegal for the war z to withhold your money do to the quality of the service and the lack of in game updates/content.

This is how I obtained my refund. Remember if they put you on hold, keep your window active! I cannot stress that enough. Also remember, be persistent! Do not take no for an answer!"	t5_2ujwe	True

Just look at page 4 and above to see what I mean.

My Thoughts on this: Since I was involved in this massive ban spree (Im legit), I think that Sergey and the devs f*cked up big time. 99% of the bans are correct? Really?!, How can you review over 2k accounts in little time? And what about the tonnes of posts about their bans?

1352684154.0	131ehj	Got the game yesterday and played it to 4 am. Played  Day Z and now I am playing this. Here is my 2 cents.	metacomidor	16	5	13	"I've decided to do one of these things of my 5 likes and my 5 dislikes of the game so far. Now I know these have been done a crap ton but I'll try to be constructive. 

First loading into the game I was pleased to find that the player characters actually meshed in well with the dark and the fog (not sure whether that's due to me playing on ultra or what not but still) welcome find I feel like I am actually hidden when prone in a dark forest. I've escaped and ambushed many people by just going prone in a bush and watching them I think they nailed the whole character doesn't stand out like a sore thumb thing on ultra again haven't played on lowest yet so Ill have to test that.

Secondly The Global Inventory a love hate issue for many. My personal feelings is that it keeps people in the game with out being a 100% blow to the balls. Although the other side of the coin I feel that with clans and end game players they would be running with their own armory and be able to just come back into the game with full on sniper armor camo shit. My main problem with Global inventory is just it is too easy to just camp spawns and server hop and fill a back pack with military loot and just have no loss in death.

Third, The zeds! Dangerous yet manageable with out being overly annoying. (Here's where the comparisons with DayZ arise). Zeds in Dayz are just annoying. They really don't hit hard and are more annoying for just causing status effects, broken bones and bleeding and pain. Most guns kill them in 1 shot regardless of where you hit them and their animations are so jerky that hitting one in the heady with ARMA's signature gun swaying gun play really is just annoying. Now in The WarZ I feel zombies are handled a hell of a lot better (yes I know DayZ is getting a standalone but I'm just going off of whats available.) They are slower can be out ran and you can lose them. They hit hard and can kill you quick if your not careful. They path correctly and all in all look like actual zombies. 

Fourthly, Exploring! I hope this gets fleshed out like more houses are open for exploring especially out in the boonies. In DayZ 90% of homes and buildings where just a pixelated door in front of a house with a soup can on the front porch. WarZ has this issue in many places but it doesn't seem near as many from what I've seen I feel like going to ever house I see in WarZ cause chances are there will be goodies.

Fifthly, the potential, now if this game is indeed in its alpha stages and is still being worked on as much as they say then hell yeah... so far. I've alpha and beta tested many of games in my time and if this game is an ""alpha build"" then I'm mostly impressed. guns work fine spawns work world loads doesn't crash and a shit load of servers to play from. If this game keeps this up it very well could be the definitive zombie survival sim out there.

Now for what I don't like so far. Guns are way to common and ammo is way to rare. Now let me explain this, from my perspective a player should have been grabbing ammo and what not and not as many guns. my locker in just 1 night I have 3 sniper rifles 8 assault rifles 7 shotguns and like 30 pistols all of which have little or no ammo in any of them. My point is that ammo should be where guns are and guns should be where ammo is in reference to their spawns. 

How the world is just a FFA at the get go. I usually roll friendly as long as possible until I just say fuck it after being blasted by people saying their friendlies or are a new character who doesn't know every thing yet and decides to hit me with his or her flashlight. I understand its a trust game. In which you build bonds and forge friends through the turmoil but how long do you think that will work for casuals to the game. With how brutal people are to each other in this game I don't see people playing it to long and not just go play some other fps games about survival not FFA ""lol call of duty bull"" shit. Although you can attribute this to the amount of guns are in the game and people can just find them with in 30 seconds of spawning in most places. 

Safezones I get it I get it places for people to put up their feet and trade and what not. It works its nice I understand. I know they aren't done and will have NPCs and ""mission granters"" at them but here's just an idea. Let me transport between them! Sense i cant choose my spawn at least give me the means to meet my friends in less than 3 hours before one of us gets lamed by some random player.

But all in all its been fun so far and I still feel the urge to keep playing it even when its in its alpha stage. So here's to a hopeful future with this game huh?

Finally decided to venture into the big city on my only female character (with a gasmask, large pack, 2 shotguns, and a 9mm) after skirting around several small firefights I make my way into a multistory building, and promptly get a bullet in my head upon arriving at the 2nd floor. 

Unexpected, and I'll admit I jumped. I stuck ingame just long enough to see my killer get taken out in an almost identical fashion. 

Out of almost morbid curiosity, I jump back on the same server with my other almost as geared toon - one with a sniper rifle. Come in at the lake just north of the town, and make it 2 blocks in before parking myself ontop of a van - hearing/seeing gunflashes/shots the whole way. Sure enough, some other fellow is in the same building and is taking potshots at whoever he can see.

I'll admit, a certain other zombie game helped me here as I assumed there would be some bullet drop. Took the guy square in the back. Checked my stats later, sure enough he was a bandit.

1350832911.0	11ugo6	Making Colorado a better place!	cutmore19	18	6	8	Last night, I amassed quite a few hammers in my medium backpack and got an idea. I always got frustrated by having no weapon going into spawn city. (The town north of the big city, by the oval lake) So I decided that I would take 7 hammers and wait on the outskirts for new players to spawn. When the first player spawned, I ran up to him and asked if he needed a weapon and when he quickly said yes I dropped a hammer and backed off. At this point I was expecting to get my head smashed in with the hammer I had just given away because of how ruthless most people had been up to this point. But surprisingly, he said thanks a lot and proceeded into the town. I waited around for 3 more people and the same thing happened! I was shocked, up to this point I had been betrayed and back stabbed at every interaction! Eventually, I walked into town and was gifting hammers there and i was shot by some bandits. But it was very refreshing to have people act in a friendly manner! I am not against bandits in anyway, I too have killed my share of people on site. But the amount of people who said thank you and that they would pass it on was awesome. The point of this post is to show that there are many bandits but there are  a lotof good players too.

I passed by the big city and figured I should stop by the outskirts to loot some tents/buildings. I am about to leave and then *BAM*. I hear a very loud gunshot maybe 50 meters away. I go towards that location carefully and then another shot rings out. I ask if he is friendly...no response. I must have not been careful enough because the next thing I know, I have 3 zombies headed right to me. I blast them with my trusty shotgun that I found earlier. 

This guy must know where I am now. I decide to circle around to the back of him and I say ""I am friendly, but if you do not respond and holster your weapon I will open fire."" I then see something or someone dash by behind a small trailer. Carefully walking over, I see a hole in the wall. He must have went through here. I go through and see him lying prone on the ground facing away from me - gun drawn and waiting for me to come around the corner. I say it again...""respond as friendly or be shot."" No response. I lay into him with 4 shotgun shells to the face but he just gets up and runs away. 1 more shot - he is down. He dropped an ALICE pack, an AK47 with a mag, a pistol, a silencer, and enough food, water, and bandages to last a long time.

However, note it is in ""redemptionPeriod"" - which is usually the time between when a domain is EXPIRED and actually deleted. Oddly - thewarz.com isn't expired.



.. so that is interesting. Let's check out the DNS servers, though - are they working?


    smalls:~ myuser$ dig +short thewarz.com @jake.ns.cloudflare.com
    108.162.204.16
    108.162.205.16

    108.162.204.16
    108.162.205.16


..nope! Turns out, DNS is fine.

 
If you go the registar's site, at http://registrar.schlund.info/ and do a ""whois"" on the domain ""thewarz.com"" - they'll tell you it isn't registered there.

As an early supporter for this game, I haven't really seen significant progress on this game when I learned it was posted on Steam and am now seriously regretting my purchase.

**update  12/20/2012**: I've contacted Paypal in regards to this issue. Because it's past 45 days (I bought the Legendary pack in October 3rd), I'm completely shit out of luck on disputing it on Paypal's end and they told me I'd have to refer to the credit card company I'm with.

I contacted my credit card company and explained them the situation. They said that unless they got an ""expert letter"" of someone who works within the video game field, I'd have to take it up with the BBB. Even though I have told them about the news that blowing up all over the web, they're not willing to budge.

I don't know anyone who works as a professional within this field, who can provide an ""expert letter"" as to why Hammerhead Studios did not deliver War Z as described. What can I do?

My friends decided to leave it and head to Fallsdale. As I hid and stalked this person ( in the TWB clan if anyone is interested) I heard her and a clan mate talking about them scoping out and killing new spawns to some guy who they killed.

He was sticking around and decided to try and join the clan. Said he liked their safe zone camping strategy. The clan member with less gear was slowly leading a couple new spawns away from the safe zone when the pumpkin head chick started hauling ass to a good vantage point. As soon as she moved I moved.

I was sticking to around 10 feet behind her. Sticking to the foliage and trees I was on her like a fly on shit. She got to her vantage point and took off her pumpkin hat. I walked up right behind her and took her out as soon as she scoped in the get a shot.

Her clan member and the new spawns came running as soon as they heard/saw the commotion. I told them what happened and that the clan member was leading them into the trap. I told the clan member to thank the pumpkin head chick for the gear and left saying this, ""Oh and if your clan finds it fun to kill new spawns and to camp outside of a safe zone they should be careful. I might be hanging around.""

TL;DR A clan was trying to camp new spawns at a safe zone. I stalked and killed the one doing the killing before she could kill anyone else."	t5_2ujwe	True

We were scouting the far west side of the airstrip when we saw it, a group of what looked to be 4 survivors. We watched as they headed up the main control tower as we slowly crept into the airstrip along the back building with a roof. After minutes of scouting and watching them snipe people from up there, my buddy and I decided to give it a go and rush them (probably not in our right minds at the time). We made a B-line for the tower and finally made it instead while agro'ing tons of zombies, thankfully they lost agro though. My friend and I discussed what our next move should be as we crept up the stairs. I decided we got this far by rushing, why not just rush them? I sprinted up the stairs with my M4 45 clip out spraying and praying down each one of them as I reached the top. I then said to my friend their dead, I killed them all. He simply replied with ""what, no way."" I was like yup and we proceeded to loot all of their stuff.

Screenshot of the loot I got in the alice rucksack I picked up :P http://i.imgur.com/7qMBl.jpg

I stopped told them to just go. Let them know I was gonna go afk and they could watch me with binoculars or their sniper scope to see that I was still turned around and facing into the safe zone. They agreed that this scenario would work for them and they headed out. I went afk for about 5-10 minutes got a drink and some snackage then hit the head.  When I returned I didn't see them so I started walking out of the safe zone. Tuned around to check my 6 and there the 3 of them were.  The one with the sniper rifle had it pointed at me, so I shot him in the face. Then the other one came at me with a pistol so i switched to my shotgun and blew his face off. The third came up with a hammer and I told him if he didn't leave me alone i was going to shoot him as well. He left.  The other guys continued to rage for about 30 minutes and how I was a liar and they knew I was going to kill them and that's why they waited to follow me.  

I don't feel like I did anything wrong. But they yelled bandit and cried in global. Said they were going to respawn and kill me again.  about 45 minutes later someone tries to sneak up on me with a hammer while I'm checking out the town near Jelly Bean Lake.  So I hit him with my pick axe a few times and he dies.  Turns out it was one of the guys that was raging.

My suggestion is that during the game, players are allowed to send a Friendly/Hostile command message to a nearby player, and it the player receiving it at the other end replies with a 'Friendly', both of them will appear in each other's 'Friendly' list for a certain of period of time. 

Now here's where it will get interesting, if anyone that is still in your list decided to suddenly kill you (backstabbing), the game would put a 'Backstabber' status on the player, similar to the Bandit status, so that people would be wary of being 'Friendly' with these players in the future.

Of course, nobody wants to be in someone's 'Friendly' list forever, so perhaps upon agreeing, the 'Friendly' status would stay for maybe 1 hour? or a few hours? Something similar to that mechanism.

After it got a lot of viewers, a twitch admin popped in and asked him to stop, so he did. 

Here are some lovely quotes from stream chat:

&gt;Censored1: i hope they take legal action against you
&gt;
&gt;Censored2: They can sue you, actually. This is a crime rofl
&gt;
&gt;Censored2: have fun with the ban 

I'm wondering why people like its their personal job to enforce the NDA. 

One user earlier today posted links to all the youtube videos he could find that had WarZ footage in order to get their accounts ""hopefully banned.""

Not only do people feel like its their job, but they actively hope people breaking the NDA ([which would be VERY unlikely hold up in court due to the game being publicly available](http://i.imgur.com/J5aWW.png)) get put in jail/sued?

Please don't bother complaining about issues you had with hackers or with finding loot. I'm talking about the small bugs or changes that might affect you in some way. As reddit is known to me as beeing a quite objective community, I'm asking you guys to build a bug list which we might then post in the official forums, or send directly to the devs. 


*Here are my least favourite bugs of the moment 05/03/13*:

* Not able to switch the perspective when in third person.

* When accessing the lockbox and you have an item selected which is in the quick-slots, it happens that the character accidentally uses this item. For example: If you have 99% health and have an Antibiotic selected, it will automatically use it when you access your lockbox.

* Add a name filter to the clans in the community page.

* Fix the favourites in the server browser.

* When going prone on some hills (probably some critical inclination), my characater can't stand up anymore.

* Give us some specific information about the protection you get from gear and also the advantages you get from the skill tree.

* Make it possible to move a lockbox. I'm not talking about beeing able to pick it up, but beeing able to change the location of it while keeping it on the same server. Lockboxes can be so map changing, specially if you give them into the hands of idiots which have access to your private server.



So as I said. Please complete this list and desist from mentioning hackers or lootspawns. Those are issues which the devs should already be kinda aware of.

1355934886.0	1544yd	Most Fun I've Had So Far!	Frogren	41	35	25	"Posted this on the WarZ forums as well and thought I would share it here also!


This might come as a surprise to most, but last night was so far the most fun I've had in game!  It started off with 3 of us, on skype, roaming around looting and killing anyone we came across.

We got to a location, that is a well known server hopping area, so we decided to stay awhile and see what trouble we could find. After about 5 minutes of waiting, our first prey came along. We took him down quite fast and easy, and got some decent loot.

After roughly 20-30 mins, we had killed a good 6 more players. Now here is where the fun really started! This one player name ""F_ck Zombiees"" came along. Saw him approaching from a good distance. When he came in range I took 3 shots. First was a head shots, 2nd shot killed him, 3rd and 4th were just in case shots.

Instantly this player started going off in proximity chat, calling me a hacker for killing him in 2 shots. How he had it all recorded, blah, blah, blah. Anyways, I ignored his comments and we continued to hunt our area we were in.

Well the player we had just killed, logged off and either deleted his character or instantly revived him, because he had logged back in under the same name. He came right back towards us, and we could see him coming. This time we allowed him to get a little closer.

He came in the gateway, and once he did I fired 3 shots into him, he ran around the corner, and I alerted my clan member he was coming to his side. This player turned the corner, and he got lit up! Anyways, this players repeated this again one more time, and died for a 3rd time.

The 4th he logged back in, but this time he tried something different. He made his way around us, up to the top of a steep hill, which we watched him do, and proceeded to crawl his way to the highest point. Once he got there, he started shooting a sniper rifle at us. His aim was horrendous!

So we decided to creep around and head up the hill and flank him. When we got close, he was nowhere to be seen! We scouted the area and had no luck finding him. After a good 5 mins of searching, we look back to where we originally were, and there was a player there! Thinking this was him, 2 of us proceeded back while 1 of us kept scout and intel of the players location.

As the 2 of us were about to arrive, our scout list sight of him. So we held our positions and waited for a few minutes to see if there was any movement. A couple minutes pass and there is no sight still, all of a sudden our scout gets killed by 3 players right on top of him. One which is this ""F_ck Zombiees"" player.

So the 2 of us each duck behind different trees. While the 3 players are looting our friends body, he is still giving us intel on the 3 and what they are doing. The players then start heading down the steep hill, right towards us 2. Since we were well hidden behind the trees, and it seemed like the 3 players had no clue we were there, we had the advantage.

We let them get even closer, and this is when the chaos started! I opened fire on one of them, hitting him a good 4 times before all 3 dropped into prone. I couldn't tell if I had killed the player, or if he was still alive. Even after me firing, they had no clue where my position was. So my other team mate started firing, and the 3 locked onto his position fast!

While the firing was going back and forth, with me shooting as well and them still not firing at me, my friend killed one! We could see the other 2 left alive and scrambling. Our other team mate, that is dead, can still easily see them, and is updating us precisely on what the 2 are doing.

So I tell my friend to cover me, and that I'm going to flank them. He starts popping off single burst shots at them, to draw there attention, and it worked perfectly! I was able to run left and get to a little hill in the ground where I could advance on the and they wouldn't even see me approaching.

I slowly crawl up the little hill, and I have a perfect side shot at one of the enemy players. I take 3-4 shots, and take him out! He didn't even see me. I proceed towards his corpse, and our dead scout tells me where the last enemy is at. I follow his directions and sure enough, he is laying in prone facing my other team mate that is still firing at the enemy.

I get a tad bit closer, and take a shot. The enemy players stands up, turns towards me, all while I'm still shooting him, and gets 2-3 shots off at me before he is taken out. All shots he fired at me, missed. Not once during the entire fire fight, did my team mate or I get shot!

Once all 3 enemies were dead, we started looting, and oh boy, did these guys have a ton of gear! While we were looting them, the players were going off in proximity chat, calling us hackers, and they were going to report us, and how we were cheating. 

Not once have we, or will we hack/cheat. We happened to out play these 3 to the point where they thought we had been cheating. If you okay this game to PvP, and with friends, communication is key! It's what got us a win in this fight. Hats off to my clam mates for making this one of the most memorable gaming experiences to date!

Also thanks to the 3 players which gave us this fight. Good job and thanks for making it fun!"	t5_2ujwe	True

1354556272.0	147jkr	Some suggestions to mitigate some of the hopping (something new)	ratdump	30	23	38	"I know the topic of server hoppers has been beaten to death... so please bear with me, I hope here to present a couple of things that could be done to mitigate the problem without making drastic changes to the gameplay; as the Devs have said a full solution needs to be carefully thought out and what I'm going to suggest here isn't meant to be a full solution; it's just meant to mitigate SOME of the hopping issues.

So the things I hope these suggestions would improve:

1) people who log out and change positions during PvP; this is done to get behind someone who is 'dug in' or otherwise gain advantage over another player in PvP.

2) people who log out in order to avoid dying; for example someone kills your buddy and grabs his items and logs off before you can retaliate.

Suggestions 1)

- no logging off in points of interest. This would also mitigate server hopping loot spots. Basically you would simply not allow anyone to log out/in inside of towns and say for a 100 meters around a town. Since most combat occurs in towns this prevents people from grabbing loot and logging off, from using server hopping to get behind enemies and reduces the ease with which players can hop a specific loot spot (police station for example). If you crash in a town possibly you could then respawn in the town but that would probably be abused so the simplest solution might be to respawn you at the nearest edge of the 'no-spawn-zone'.

Suggestion 2)

- long logout delay after firing a weapon or dealing/receiving player damage. Just damaged another player? Can't logout for 10 minutes. Would help prevent people who hop to gain an advantage in PvP and people who 'loot and run' ... doesn't do anything to prevent hopping loot spots.

Both of these solutions aren't so dramatic that they would interfere with meeting up with friends or anything like that but I think they could be a relatively easy way of mitigating some of the hopping problems everyone is experiencing.

A note on 'idle timeout' ... for both solutions you would need to increase the idle timeout to at least a few minutes. Otherwise people will just kill the game process to circumvent the logout location/time limits. It would need to work like a traditional MMO where even if you kill the game process your character remains in the game for some minimum amount of time (5-10) minutes essentially AFK. Naturally if you restart the game and rejoin you could regain control of your character."	t5_2ujwe	True

I was thinking that traps, net traps/bear traps/etc, would be an awesome addition to the game, mainly for bandits but also for anybody wanting to trap a group of zombies that are in the way of some amazing loot. 

The rope trap could be hooked up to trees or light posts. I haven't though of a way of escaping it yet though.

ATOMicrat	16	7	11	"So i am in the smaller urban area, and I am working my way around checking for anything better than the hammer i currently have.  As I move along, I notice other survivors in the area, we all tend to keep our distance to make sure our intentions are clear.  I am about half-way to the police station when I realize there is a group of 4 survivors decked out in masks, bats, and one of them had a pistol.

They start wiping out all the lone wolves in the area, then taking anything they had.  I am using third person at this point to see most of this unfold over a fence line.  I run in to the station, and when I turn to check my six i realize they were working their way to the parking lot.  I run in to the room with the cells and wait a second.  Another survivor caught their attention and 3 of them went off to chase him down, one of them must have gotten a glimpse of me because when I started walking out of the station he was waiting for me.

He was wearing a mask and wielding a hammer, Its all a blur really but i  made it out of the encounter and he didn't.  I quickly grabbed his stuff, put on the mask and just as i am about to run off His friends are back and all around me.  I expected to die, but I guess I looked just enough like him with mask and hammer that they assumed i was him.  With the area clear of any other living being, they spread out and the one with the nice backpack and pistols stays in the station.  I make quick work of him, take his backpack and fill it with all of his things.  I ran for the hills after that and logged out shortly after.

1349469690.0	110eh5	What is a Stronghold? [Answer inside]		46	37	28	"This is a post copied from the forums, written by War Z dev, Sergey Titov

**What is STRONGHOLD ?**
To put it simply it's just a fancy name for a custom tailored server rentals. Our goal is to separate ""gameworld"" server rentals - ie when you rent server with 50-200 slots and choose one of the maps ( okay for now we have only one map available - COLORADO ), and ""small worlds"" - something more intimate for you, your friends, clan, etc to make this mini world your own home base. 


**How I can rent Stronghold ?**
When you click PLAY GAME, you'll see two buttons - MY SERVERS and MY STRONGHOLDS. On My Strongholds screen you'll see all available stronghold maps. There you'll be able to choose map, duration ( 1,3,6,12 months ) and number of slots ( 15,30,45 ). Pioneer and Legend packages comes with 1 and 6 months of hosting for 15 slots. Discount will be applied automatically first time you rent stronghold server. 


**What are those maps ?**
They're much smaller maps - typically around 3-4 square kilometers in size with 1-2 ""settlements"" per map. Those ""settlements"" are planned to act as home base - for either single player or group of players. There are zombies spawned on outskirts of the map - so they're generally not a threat on those maps. But you can lure them into settlement. 

**Is there any loot on Stronghold maps ?**
There are few loot spawn locations, but loot is slightly different from what you'll get on main gameworld maps - very basic food items plus some unique ""building"" materials ""local"" to this stronghold map. We want to encourage players that run different stronghold maps to barter with other players, exchanging building ""blocks"" that can be used to modify your map.


**What can I do on the Stronghold map?**
Short answer - whatever you want. Lure other players into traps and kill them. Create a farm, farm food and sell it to other players. Create ""safe haven"" for other players to just hang out. It's all basically restricted by your imagination. 

**Can I create my own business using Stronghold map ?**
Wow ! Didn't thought about it, but technically yes nothing prevent you from doing that.

This article will be focused on the locations of loot in Campos City and Parkerville it is current as of august 7 2013.

We start off in the pharmacy, pretty straight forward, gather meds for the run:

Something special about Parker Pharmacy, 3 additional med spawns are nestled in the parking lots vans:

Now we move to the police station where once can find attachments, pistols, and the occasional assault rifle.

 http://i.imgur.com/YLYxd5Xh.jpg

Across from the police station a grassy park can be found - no go zone. Zombies are all over with an additional force of sleepers.

http://i.imgur.com/UAmp9BYh.jpg

Without sprinting, make your way over to the on ramp for the bridge, kill any zombies that may aggro on you.

Run on the medium of the bridge.

http://i.imgur.com/DNbewZEh.jpg

As you can see the zombies pathing will cause them to alternate sides, giving you a nice window of time to check these tents for loot.

This Camo Jeep often has ammo on and around it.

Now I run back and slowly dispose of the zombies.

http://i.imgur.com/Dsm2inTh.jpg

Take your time, kill them all.

**Tip:** While one zombie is stun locked from being hit, hit their friend, this is how you can take on 3 or more zombies at once!

http://i.imgur.com/AbnMhVRh.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/hLOUZE6h.jpg

Towards the bottom of the ramp as you depart for five story, you can jump off without taking damage, check for sprinters and neabry zombies and swing on them once then make a break for it!

This spot is awesome for losing this crowd.

Farm Guns, Medium packs, and Consumables can be found abundantly here, but I tend to skip to the top for the one rare spawn point.

**Tip:** If you didnt know, the campos five story roof can be accessed by running to the third floor and jumping up the fire escape.


http://i.imgur.com/xMyd01Lh.jpg

Spawn is empty.

http://i.imgur.com/41UT0Odh.jpg

Now I go back down and proceed to the sand bagged area to loot more ammo:

APC has one ammo spawn next to it.

1375506095.0	1jm1ba	The story of the BAN	cowboyhowdy	17	9	13	"I have been playing Infestation for about 6 months now and have seen a lot of changes to the game.....some good, some bad, and some awful. I was a heavy PVE player and once I got together with a clan I played quite a bit of PVP. I have seen a lot of hackers in my day unfortunately and was glad to see game play become a little safer from hackers after punkbuster came out. 

Then after the Steam sale the game became infested with hackers again (kind of ironic; rename the game to infestation)...... Quite frankly after the steam sales I quit playing the game. I also have done very little PVP since the first steam sale.

After seeing the high jumpers and people CLEARLY walking thru walls to kill me (all of which I reported) I stopped playing the game. Fast forward about a month with no game play I login to my account to do some PVE on my private server (WHICH I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR) I get banned.

Now I have private server that I have already rented for 4 months that I will never be able to renew....all my lockers gone (which I had to pay money for). I have invested a lot of money in to this game and this is how you are treated with no explanation.

So, I put in my ticket to get my ban looked at, but I have no confidence that it will ever be considered. WHY? Because I am not a popular streamer? 

Also, I really do not even have many kills on any of my toons.....I do not even think I have a single character over 30 kills, but according to this game I am a hacker and get banned with no cause.

I know these stories are a dime a dozen, but this is exactly why I will most likely never play this game again and will cut my losses. I will not ever promote this game and can never suggest a friend to purchase this game. "	t5_2ujwe	True

Don't get me wrong, I think on paper the design of WarZ sounds really good. Marketplaces, RMT, emphasis on PVP and smooth FPS engine, safehouses, global inventory, skills, missions, etc. It sounds bang-up. But, yeah, obviously, it's taking awhile. HI is a small relatively inexperienced company so this is to be expected. And I guess the only reason I really *care* is because I really, really like the premise of where the game is going, and frustrated it isn't there yet.

That said, I may go back to DayZ for a bit. Hopefully within 6 months WarZ will have its shit together and be able to bring all of its guns to the table. That's the best I can hope for, right?"	t5_2ujwe	True

1354680432.0	14ayq5	Why so many people are disappointed in this game and are leaving the community.	Nurver	71	61	149	"The reason so many people are asking for refunds and just dropping like flys is because of the terrible lack for work this game gets put into it. Honestly, let's compare War Inc. to WarZ. They're literally the same game. There's no denying it, it's all right there, the models are pulled straight from it and everything. I personally thought this game had a lot of potential, and it really did. 

Things are just out of hand now, with the whole refund situation, the banning and now the ex forum mod situation. On the tune of banning, it seems like all the wrong people are being banned. People are being banned because their logins failed? Yet you'll see a guy super jumping and going thru the map with a shot gun and he doesn't get punished. There are WAY too many hackers in this game because they all transferred over from War Inc. because they use the same exact engine and everything! 

If Sergey had a team devoted to making this game as good as it could be, it would be a great game. It seems like they are spending more time getting worked up about all the wrong things. Almost every time someone states their opinion on the forums or anywhere for that matter, they get banned or shunned. I'm really sad what this game has become. This is why people are just getting up, taking their money back and leaving. It's because we were lied to about WarZ. Not because it's a scam or anything, because of the lack of just pure effort being put into this game. When I (rarely) play this game now, it doesn't even feel like a zombie survival game. I don't worry about the undead, I worry about the living. Not because I fear he or she is going to kill me for my bottle of water or can of food, it's because I fear I'm going to lose all of my gear I've struggled to collect because of some guy flying around the map. 

When I think of the ""zombie apocalypse "" I think of the world deteriorating day by day, having to actually work with the ones left living in order to survive, having to conserve my ammunition and even make my own weapons. In a situation like this, I don't think that everyone in a small town in Colorado carries an military grade assault rifle, while the mail men are packing AA-12's on their deliveries and the local market has their shelf's stocked with STANAG ammo and military grade packs. If this game was to make an attempt to fix itself, there would be less military loot, a hell of a lot less, and way more civilian based weaponry, such as low caliber pistols, shot guns (not the mossberg or a KSG, like a double barrel), some hunting sniper rifles, hunting bows (Crossbow and regular bow) and a lot of melee weapons. 

Also, another thing that needs to be completely wiped out of WarZ. The marketplace and the global inventory. These features in theory are very cool, but they are ridiculous. These completely destroy any shred of reality this game has. I could understand someone wanting a head start and what not, but the hats are ridiculously stupid. This game feels like TF2 at times. The marketplace and global inventory summed up are bad ideas because you could purchase gold coins in-game with REAL money, and lose them the second you spawn in. I'm surprised these items aren't time based! All in all, this game could be ten times better. I hope they put some real effort into this game instead of patrolling the forums for people who oppose their game. In case you were wondering why people are taking their money and running, I hope you have an answer now."	t5_2ujwe	True

1352323776.0	12ti92	Has Anyone Else Become 'Zen' Yet?	OneSullenBrit	13	3	14	"I was just wondering, has anyone else started accepting death in WarZ yet?

When I first started playing WarZ, I was coming from a long break from DayZ (4+ months). I stopped playing DayZ because I was sick of spending ages looking for a weapon only to get it taken by a buggy zombie or a sniper I couldn't see.

When I started up WarZ, the first thing I found, the very first thing, was a Saiga shotgun. At the time, I had no idea how rare weapons were, so I ran out of the house I was in, ran up to 2 zombies who had just killed a player (this was first day of Alpha so everyone had a torch, food, water and bandages on spawn), and promptly took their heads off.

I was then killed from behind by a torch-wielding player.

Even back then, in my loot-rarity naivety, I raged. I raged that I died for no reason, I raged that I didn't get to use the shotgun properly, I raged that I didn't get to check out anything in the game.

Since then I have died countless times. I have learned not to go out decked out (I play solo for now, nobody in UK to play with), so I almost always start fresh, I find that having a gun makes you a target more than it protects you, especially when you aren't a bandit.

I no longer care if I die.

I'll give you my most recently example:
This morning I spawned, as usual, near the Airfield. I go straight to the crashed plane, and find some bandages, then move on to the Airfield, making for the nearest crashed heli. On the way, I notice 2 players running across the landing strip, so I ask if they are friendly. They reply that they are, and I banter for a few seconds before making my way to the tower. I go up to the top, where I find a bat and some water, and I hear footsteps. Running outside, I spot 2 players coming up the stairs, holding guns. I panic slightly, but figure that I won't be able to kill them, so I'm done for, but they don't attack. Not wanting to outstay my welcome, I sprint back down the stairs, taking out a zombie on the way, and head to the hangers. I go in from the back, and after a bit of searching I find a dead player with a zombie standing over him. After killing the zombie, I find a pistol (3 rounds), shotgun (1 round) large and medium backpacks, hat, and loads of food, water and med supplies. Just as I am gearing up, I hear a burst of gunfire, what sounds like a pistol and an automatic weapon. I whip out the pistol as someone runs around the corner, and I fire all 3 rounds. I run behind the big bit of machinery, and take out the shotgun, but get killed.

It turns out that I accidentally attacked the friendly pair from earlier, thinking they were bandits.

Did I rage? No. Did I lament my sudden loss of shogun, pistol and life? No. Did I call them all the names under the sun? No.

I apologised for the mistake, told them what I had, and logged out.

Don't get me wrong, being killed by a hacker still riles me up (I was killed by an invisible noclipper last night, just after finding my very first M16, didn't get to fire it once). I'll accuse them in global chat and warn people where they are. Also if I'm murdered by a bandit with no provocation I'll call out their location. But death in WarZ holds no fear over me any more.

**TL:DR- I no longer fear death.**

However, I've heard very conflicted things about it and the gameplay I've seen so far on YouTube doesn't look very good. I want to play this, but I don't want to waste my my money.

1352092101.0	12nito	It would be nice if item descriptions displayed number values and more detailed explanations of their effects.	caolpolo	12	5	10	"For example, I have no idea what the difference between an M16 and an M4 is, and when I check the various Wikis they all give different or contradictory information. [Here](http://www.warzwiki.com/M16) it says an M16 does 27 damage, and kills in 2 body shots. An [M4,](http://www.warzwiki.com/M4) 35 damage but 3 body shots?

[This site](http://www.warzwiki.com/Headgear) says helmets give no protection, but [this one](http://www.twzwiki.com/view/List_of_Equipment) says they give damage protection.

Deciding on a melee weapon, how am I to choose between a hammer and a spiked baseball bat? The bat sounds like it would probably be better based on common sense, you would think it would have a longer reach and do more damage, but this doesn't seem to be the case in-game. And there's no way to know that until you try. It's just really unintuitive.

As for consumables, there's no way to tell in-game exactly what effects different foods have, in terms of % of hunger/thirst/health relief (or damage, in the case of things like a bag of chips), you can only find that information on the wikis, and from their contradictory nature I'm not so sure they're accurate anyway.

And what about vaccines and such? Do they even have a use at this point? I don't think I've ever been ""infected"".

Only once have I found a single M4 semi, and I didn't find any more ammo for it in the entire rest of the airfield.

1351324936.0	125zyf	Beautiful day in ghost town	xandaril	11	5	4	"So, I just north of ghost town. This is the town by the lake that looks like a bean. And I know that this town always has a ton of people in it but I have always called it ghost town for some reason. I ran into the back side of the police station and while walking through I found a pistol with 12 or 13 rounds in it. Afterward I quietly walked over to the market place watching around to see if there was anyone near by. As I was crossing the street next to the firetruck I heard a sniper go off and a bullet hit somewhere next to me. I freaked out and ran into the small market as 2 more snipers rounds go off. This guy must have had such terrible aim...

I slowly looted this market while watching the enterance. I was hoping to find something to help out a bit. Found a bunch of bandages and antibiotics. Atleast 2 of each. So, I figued if the guy come in looking for me I can quickly use those if I am hit. So, for about 2 minutes I sat in a corner waiting for this guy. Eventually I heard some footsteps outside of the building so I layed down and got ready to take him out. He comes in and I take 3-4 shots off at his head and I probably only hit him once. He turned around and saw me in the corner. We both just spammed the trigger for a second. I got hit atleast 3 times and I am sure I hit him a bunch as well. I popped the antibiotics that I had and got most of my health back. I then sprinted out of the building with him following me. I turned around and saw that he took out a hammer. Looking down at my ammo, I found that I had nothing left. And had no other weapon so I just ran like a hell behind the building and saw a bunch of zombies. I ran through the zombies jumped up on a car and they started going for him and got between him and I. I then ran accross the street to the firestation and OMG A HAMMER!!! I quickly grabbed that and went out looking for where he went. Then... SNIPER FIRE! F***!!!

I run down the street as a few more sniper rounds go off most likely in my direction. I saw 2 other people at the military vehicle down by the super market. They both had pistols out... I looked down at proximity as one of them said, ""im friendly, dont fire."" Thinking to myself, ""THANK GOD"". So, I ran past the sandbags and go into the market there. I found some more bandages and some other stuff. I think I picked up an akm clip as well. But nothing to fire back at that sniper. I step out of the market and the two with guns were still there behind the sandbags. I jump over the ones closest to the market and I hear that darn sniper shooting at me again!!! We all just fell to the floor and stayed prone for a second. One of the 2 people started coming near me with his pistol drawn... So, I decided to drop my empty pistol to give him something to focus his attention on instead of killing me. He picked it up and then stood up turned around and fired at the other person standing there. WTF?! So, I stood up and my new hammer met the back of his spine... Another sniper round goes off and hits me. Taking me down to about 20%. Popped some antibiotics and layed down again.

Hoping that the sniper is not able to see me, I started looting these two bodies next to me. More medical stuff and those three pisols. 2 with mostly full ammo. There was a large backpack and a bunch of food stuffs. So, I then got up and sprinted to the post office. This time I did not hear any sniper fire. I think this guy is finally out. He waisted so many rounds on me. So, sitting here in the post office thinking about disconnecting. I decided not to pussy out and keep on going. Its no fun just giving up. Even with how tempting it was with all this new loot. So, I started out of the building and saw that same guy as before coming around the corner at me with his pistol out again. He took a shot off at me (I thought he was empty) and I put two 9mm bullets in his head and he finally went down. Damn that was a good fight! I grabbed his empty sniper and his Jerico. Went back into the post office and logged out. I needed to let my heart slow down before I get back on. Whoever that sniper was, I must applaud you for giving me an amazing fight. And you really need to learn how to shoot straight! You missed me atleast 9 times...

I truthfully belive that bandits are the best thing about this game. Stuff like this makes me never want to get off. I love it when stuff like this happens and I don't care if someone comes out on top and I lose a large backpack full of amazing stuff. I will likely do the same to another guy some other time down the road like today. Now back to Ghost Town for some more fun!"	t5_2ujwe	True

**WarZ and that other game are about people first, and zombies second.  It is *extremely* important that everyone gets to experience this, and on as even of a playing field as possible.**

There has been a lot of small talk and grumbling about people talking after death, global chat breaking immersion, etc. I'm not even going to touch on that, because the solution as I see it is apples to oranges.  The whole system needs overhauled.  Here is what I would like to see out of the release client's in-game communication system:

* **Three Tiered In-Game Voice Com**  We need people to be able to group up together MMO-style, and these groups need to have their own chat channel that only they can hear- and at any distance.  People can do it with 3rd party programs, there is no reason to disadvantage people who want to work with strangers in-game, just for the sake of ""realism.""  Secondly, we need to have 2 ranges for in-game voice communication between un-grouped players.  A ""shout"" and a ""talk / loud whisper"" distance would work great.  This would greatly reduce the tactical disadvantage a single, large radius in-game chat channel would impose on strangers communicating for the first time.

* **WarZ needs a death screen.**  Once you are dead, you aren't coming back.  You should not be able to ghost inside your body - however, you should still be able to communicate with your friends, be it a stranger you grouped with in-game or someone you are Skyping with - as inevitably, you will want to meet up again to keep playing.  Dead players should remain in their group, and have full group voice chat, even as they switch characters.  Remember, no reason to disadvantage people who are grouping up with strangers.  Disable in-game chatting and radius voice com, though.

* **Global and Proximity chats - probably still a good thing.**  This game has safe zones, and one of their major functions is to encourage trading (IMO).  Global chat is a great asset for this style (probably not so good for that other game).  Proximity chat needs to be there as a catch-all for people without microphones.  Typing in a game like this is ill-advised, but it shouldn't be impossible.

Think about how many War Z stories you read on here.  How many of them are about survival or zombies?  They are about people, and usually groups of people.  It would be a disservice to stifle communication between players who want to work together in any way, especially given the fact that they are already disadvantaged to survivors using 3rd party chat clients.  I believe an implementation like how I outlined above is not only good, but necessary for the long term success of this game, and people need to start making a lot more noise about it."	t5_2ujwe	True

1350486754.0	11msb3	WarZ so far (17 Oct) a review.	Felski	41	32	56	"Hello,

i played WarZ since the release. Here is my experience.
# Overall:
* graphic: the graphics are okay, some graphic bugs like bad placed rocks (i can walk into the rocks from behind, etc.). the ultra graphic looks nice, but not overwhelming, but i recently played Guild Wars 2 on Ultra, so 
* launcher: the launcher is nice and easy. you can join servers easy and fast. at the current state it is easy to find a server to play with friends.
* PvE: its fine. zombie die easy 1on1. i can handle 3 zombies atm if im cautions. more zombies are a mess.
* food and water: you find enough to survive. sometimes you find to much. but overall its okay
* weapons: way to much. played like 2 hours since patch. found 5 weapons.
* ammunition: really rare, but that is okay. found 4 clips since release.

# state of warz compared to dayz:
* inventory: warz is better, but not perfect (swaping large amounts of loot to or from global takes to much time)
* looting: warz is better
* general walking etc: warz is smoother imo, but dayz give more options here.
* shooting: i have no experience here

# Bug and Tips:
* zombies lose aggro if you jump on higher ground (a car for example)
* save your stuff in the global inventory, just do it!
* if you have to, aggro zombies 1by1 with a higher ground nearby.
* save your stamina for the right situation
* dont erase your character. they respawn close to the place they died.
* dont use bright hats/mask(for example a skull mask) at night
* if you re in first person mode and u press right mouse click you can switch your angle with shift.
* juice and i think it was tuna raise both bars, hunger and thirst
* you can find loot in buildings and cars. 
* zombies usally mean that there is loot around

Thats my experience and all i know so far. Have fun! :D

***05-16-2012***
&gt;We have the engine 
&gt;We have artists
&gt;We have programers
&gt;We have designers
&gt;We have tech
&gt;
&gt;We've been working on our own zombie for PS3 (Sony's request) for a while.
&gt;
&gt;Would you guys play this if we make it on PC as a huge open world like in Chernarus. With lots of towns, villages, drivable vehicles, clans, trading merchants, resources, etc?
&gt;
&gt;We are thinking about doing this right now. This way you wont have problems with servers, buggy environment and combat system, and all the exploration zombie surviving you want 
&gt;
&gt;How about it?

***05-16-2012***
&gt;No we are not going to make it a Free To Play Game.
&gt;
&gt;F that
&gt;
&gt;Most likely it will be one time purchase fee for something like $15-20. Similar to Minecraft. 
&gt;However there will be GOLD currency in the game that you can purchase for real $ money. With that currency you can buy attachments for weapons, different skins, different cute things, but nothing to make you ""WIN"" in this game. Its gona be more for ""comfort"" and cosmetic. 
&gt;
&gt;Everything that you will be able to buy in the store will be scattered and placed around in the WORLD. You just have to find it  And I mean everything. But we wont let people who are spoiled rich or well off in real life purchase Hummer with a 50 cal and 5 HK 417s with top of the line scopes. NOPE, not gona happen. You must find it first to even see it in the Merchant Store.
&gt;
&gt;Merchant stores and safe zones will be placed through out the world, very similar to Fallout 3. There will be towns in which there will be Walled Off Districts for players to rest, sleep, take a bath, buy a meal, restock their supplies for their next adventure. Flirt or have *** with others   or check message boards and postings. Most likely even pick up a job/quest by a real person. The guns will not be allowed in those zones to avoid chaos and mayhem. But be careful when you exit out of the Safe Zone. There will be players who will turn barbarians or raiders. Everyone will be free to make their own faction or a clan too.
&gt;
&gt;Another thing we are going to give players is the chance to earn their own Gold (Real money currency). There will be special types of zombies roaming through the world at very special places, and only at night. If you kill them, you can get their Brain Stem Cells, and trade that at the nearest merchant, trading post, city, for REAL GOLD. So players will have the chance to go and get those Stem Cells and make real money. Those zombies wont be a joke to deal with though, so you will have to pack military gear to fight them, or work together with a friend. 
&gt;

I feel like the future is very bleak.  After a lot of minor updates and downtime, they have come back with a new forum, and more very minor updates.  Some of which are causing more controversy.  A substantial update (a worthwhile update) would be the addition of new content and features.  This could be Vehicles, Expanding Cities/Buildings, New Maps, and new features.  This isn't being done.  A LOT of time has passed since the last substantial update, and it appears nothing is being done.

As you probably know, their systems were recently hacked.  The hackers gained access to everything including the source files which have now been released.  Looking at these files, there is nothing to show much future development of any kind.  These were their latest files before this new minor patch.  In the editor you can see a new map.  It is a smaller map, possibly a stronghold map, which uses all of the same 3D models and terrain as the Colorado map.  There is very little to show that anything new or substantial is in development - and these are their latest files.  I'm not bashing the game, I wish Hammerpoint could prove everyone wrong and meet the games potential by developing substantial updates.  Based on their original timelines many of these ""planned"" features should have already been developed and yet there is nothing in their files to show that they have even remotely been worked on.

Now, to be clear, I'm not an expert on anything.  I'm stating my personal opinion based on what I know and what I've seen.  I may be wrong about certain things, if I am feel free to post about it.  I just felt it was important to point out.  Those of you, like me, who had hoped to see big things still happen to War Z - I wouldn't bet on it anymore based on the current evidence. "	t5_2ujwe	True

i've also found some animation changes on some melee weapons, grass and stones texture changes, and physics changes so we'll have to wait for the official patch notes to see what these exactly are  
i think they added different animations in prone/crouch/stand/run we'll have to check that out  
  
note: this is the stuff that i found, i've found a good amount of files which are changed that i can't look into, and there may be more changes server-side

1355726712.0	14ze84	Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, A Simple Understanding of War Z Bandits	Pseudopacifist	15	8	7	"Look into the Wikipedia Article on Prisoner's dilemma subsection iterated prisoner's dilemma, as it is easy to relate this basic idea to The War Z.  This is one of the basic reasons that Bandits are so common.  

Example: Two players or groups meet both parties have two basic options, friendly (This entails avoiding contact entirely) or hostility (Includes setting up booby traps and fake ""Friendly"" calls to lure people in.)
In most cases both groups choose hostility, as while the shooting, intelligence gathering, and getting the jump on the player(s) matters greatly in winning a gun fight.  It's a matter of possible threat and reward.  A person who knows were you are poses a threat to where you plan to go, as they could tail you and help set up some form of trap.  As well as this stranger who you don't know, can't hear, and have no repercussions for brutally murdering may have all sorts of goodies and loot.  Where as working together even in its best case scenario reduces the amount of loot that you individually or your group gets as you have to share.  And there's no way to tell when that other party will defect.  (And attempt to murder you)

Numerically: You have 5 guns they have 5 guns.  You work together share loot, you leave with 7 guns they leave with 7 guns.  You defect they work together, they leave as a corpse and a pile of loot for you.  You loot and leave as fast as you can as the threat of them or someone who heard the gun shots showing up in force is a possibility.  You find two guns on the way out you leave with 12 they leave with nothing.  And vice versa, they defect you work together.  they leave with 12 and you're the corpse.  And since both sides defecting rarely leaves both sides with 0 guns. (In rare cases I've found 2-6 dead people's gear with ammo that makes sense that A killed B and B was subsequently finished off by zombies.)  It is almost always a better option to attack your fellow man.

Now here's where value comes in.  In many cases people are far more aggressive towards others because of a sense of value.  For example,  new spawns are almost always more likely to want to work with another person as they have little/nothing to lose if they die aside from a little bit of time and that ohh so delicious granola bar.  Given the War Z world as it is where guns and ammo are scarce at best (Damn server hoppers making this worse.)  Where  someone with even so much as an M16 or M4 semi.  A very basic and common, but very effective gun is less inclined to be friendly, as if they die to someone with a hammer or the like they just lost loot that even somewhat common in nature is still very valuable in most situations.  And this escalates the more well off a person is.

Lastly, this is where the iterated part comes in.  Past actions in a prisoner's dilemma style situation dictate future actions.  (Or as I like to put it, being an ass is contagious.)  So group A defected after B had been generous enough to give him a gun, and group B died and lost his M4 auto and his RDS attacthment amongst other various loot.  Now B respawns at a safe zone rearmed with his less spectacular Mossberg, and immediately runs into another person C (or in some cases person A who had killed B) who hadn't seen him yet and wasn't quite in the safe zone yet.  Since past actions against B have been hostile, B is more likely to take his chances and maybe get back some of what he lost (or get even more than he lost) by preying upon this unwary person rather than allow them to reach the safe zone.

TL;DR:  Look at Wikipedia Prisoner's dilemma explains WarZ bandits.

My suggestions for making zombies a little more difficult is to maybe add in more of them, give them a longer sight radius, and make it so you draw packs of them - like now, when you can draw just one zombie out of a pack, instead that zombie would alert the other zombies around it, which would kind of create a chain, and you end up drawing a pack.  That would add for more suspense when entering a settlement, I think.  And I fully support the idea of roving hordes going across the map.

And why the hell have I not turned into a zombie yet?  I mean, I've been scratched quite a few times, and I have all these vaccine shots lying around.

I think that maybe if the zombies are more of an issue in this game, then we might see a rise in PvE and a fall in PvP, which would be awesome.  I for one am tired of being shot every time I log on.  In fact, this game has less of a ""survive the zombie apocalypse"" vibe and more of a ""don't get shot in the back by every person you see"" vibe.

1351890812.0	12j8bm	One of the best times I've had in The War Z: DR Murdoc's Last Stand	comeincloser	9	1	3	"It's been a week since I've had to run around and scavenge, low on supplies..food, water, medical 
supplies, and I still have yet to find something to defend myself with.  I've had a few 
close calls with bandits and zombies but so far I have been able to get myself out of 
these situations unscathed, but I can only be so lucky for so long.  I've seen countless 
others fall from the dangers this new world presents.  Back to present day, I had to 
leave to get supplies anything that I could find.  I stumbled across a small town of 
course overrun with the undead, but what isn’t infested with them these days?  I ran the 
perimeter to make sure that the only movement I saw was from the rotting flesh-bags that 
stood between me and the things that I needed to be able to survive.  

I decided to head into the city in daylight..which could've been my first mistake..but I really needed some supplies..Sneaking around active zombies in the area I raided a supermarket and found almost everything that I needed except for a darn weapon.  I scored a few granola bars, three bottles of water, oatmeal, binoculars and some bandages!  As I was packing everything in to my pack I heard gunshots outside of the supermarket window. I flew to the floor panicked.  Looking out I see two other survivors fighting off a group of zombies, as I watch, one of them falls dead, the other managed to survive the others but he looked hurt, I could tell as he was bleeding profusely.  He seemed to also be out of ammo too as the last few zombies he dispatched he used a hatchet so at least I was safe at a distance.  Holding on to the last shred of humanity that I had left I slowly walked up to the lone survivor and asked if he needed any help, and that I was not a threat unless he was.  The stranger nodded as if to say that he did need my help.  Being a doctor in my previous life (before this mess..) I took out my freshly found supplies and bandaged his wounds. This could be considered mistake number two. In return he let me take his friends equipment which was nothing major but enough to keep me going for a while, food, drinks but no meds or weapons of any sort.  We talked for a while and he asked if I would like to join up with him, he said that he is on his way to meet up with his brother and some friends, I had to decline his offer though, it was hard enough for me to walk up to this guy and help him out, if I was 
traveling with him I would always be on edge. Regretfully this is probably mistake number 
three, but either choice would probably have the same result in the end. We say our thank you's and part ways and I go back to scavenging for supplies. I creep up to a barn with no supplies left in it but there is a window in the top that seems like it would have a good view so I take my binoculars and scout the area, no survivors in sight just tons of rotting walking corpses.  Looking around I see no supplies either until.. there across the street and to the left! I can see it through a broken out window its a gun! 

I flew down the barn stairs as fast as I could without making a sound and look for a good path to reach the building containing my prize,  but there are zombies on all sides of me and the building.  No way to 
get in unnoticed.  maybe I should sneak around the perimeter of the town and go in from the back!That's what I was thinking and as I turned around to make my way to the outside edge of the town. As I turn I see the survivor from earlier, the one that I bandaged up running at me zombies in tow...hes 
running full speed towards me wielding a metal baseball bat! I freeze in horror not knowing what to do and.....THWAP! he hits me across the face with the bat, I hear a slight ding in the air and everything goes black for a minute, ears-ringing.  I must've only been out for a minute as he was standing over me about to deliver the final blow to end me, now I was thinking that it was all over, but luckily from behind him the zombies start their attack!  This occupies him long enough that I can get up and make a break for the building with the gun I saw earlier.  Not caring about any walkers in my way i push through them and make my way to the building.  The other survivor must've seen me because he 
started booking it in my direction again with his bat held high above his head.  Trying to push myself harder I run and jump through the window and quickly pick up the gun, the other survivor hot on my heels i turn around faster than lightning and..... BAM! I blast the fucker in the face with my newly acquired shotgun, he flies back and drops his weapon, spilling his other supplies from his backpack.

 Now I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world, I've got so many supplies and now weapons!  I thought everything was going good until I heard them..a large group of zeds heading my way.  I start to panic..no bandages and I'm bleeding.  I pull up my shotgun and start blasting away.  Only seven shells left. The first zombie gets blasted in the face throwing him in to a wall the second I blow through the window I just jumped through not long ago.  The third and fourth went down without a problem.  Only three shells left and about 6 zombies left, I look for another way out and there is none.  I blast two more away from me but I realized how futile my fight is becoming.  More and more zeds start spilling in, they must be hearing  all the damn noise my gun is making.  I go for the broken window that i entered the building through, but they are already flocking to it outside.  My last bullet I use as I'm jumping out of the window to clear a zombie from my path.  Now I am all out of ammo with a large group of 
zombies after me.  I run for the woods and as I reach the edge of town I see a bloody hammer lying on the ground, I stop to pick it up.  This might've been one of the last mistakes I ever 
made..I wonder if what it would've been like if I hadn't stopped.  Anyways, I pick it up and run up the nearest hill and into the forest but they just wont stop coming for me.  All out of stamina i turn around to welcome the coming onslaught of decaying  flesh heading straight for me I hold my hammer high and yell a war-like call as I start bashing them in their heads blood spattering everywhere I smash and bash away until there is one more zombie left.  I've almost won! I have some of my stamina restored from adrenaline of the fight and the thought of actually winning.  With this final burst of adrenaline I run up to him hammer raised to the night sky ready to be brought down upon the head of this last rotting pile of flesh and BANG – BANG! everything goes dark from red to black I start to fade.  With my last breath of life I see another survivor running up with a rifle BANG!  He blasts the last zombie away, making my drawn out fight to the death with them seem all in vain.  Everything turns to black as I release my last breath and fade away.  Everything ended so fast, of all the times I thought I would die I actually thought that I was going to live through this.  That’s my last and final mistake, letting my guard down, thinking there was actually hope in this new decaying world."	t5_2ujwe	True

My absolute biggest problem is the hour timer upon death. I understand the reasoning; there should be a punishment for failure and simply hitting respawn makes death a small concern. However, I deleted and rerolled my character 7+ times in my two hours trying to learn the ropes. Once I was chased down by a guy with a hammer, another a player with a baseball bat. The rest were being cornered by zombies, which I slowly learned to avoid.

I think it's poor game design that I'm essentially forced to take a break for an hour or roll an alt if something goes wrong. Misstep and pull a horde of zombies? Log out for an hour. New friend turned out to be not so friendly? Log out for an hour.  The fact that most of the time I was time-out'd 5x the amount of time I spent playing a character was incredibly frustrating. Once I""ve learned the ropes I'll likely live longer but regardless, being forced off my character for an hour isn't fun.  I'm enjoying the game, why would the devs want to force me off of it?

The timer is especially punishing to new players who are learning the game and might die within just a few minutes of spawning while they learn controls, how to avoid zombies, etc. Nothing kills the new-game-joy-buzz like being kicked off for an hour right after getting started.

""So just delete the character and start again!"" I did! But it turns out if you roll over 5 characters you stop spawning with a flash light or any other supplies. I'm used to this in DayZ but being stripped of my flashlight was pretty brutal for a new WarZ player.

Anyways, I guess that's all I really want to say. I look forward to seeing how this game develops but, TBH, if it comes down to 10 minute playtimes with hour long time outs I'm not sure I'll be able to see much of it at all.

**TL;DR:** 1 hr death timer is punishing to new players learning the game; makes it difficult to get hooked on an otherwise pretty neat game."	t5_2ujwe	True
1351659441.0	12du2i	To everyone bitching about the graphics, AND zombies.	Whoppah	23	18	14	"First off, the game hasn't been expand yet, so the zombie buff will probably make more sense once they introduce more loot spots. (More stuff to kill zombies with = better). Secondly if, on low, the grass had ALWAYS been there from the start, not a single one of you would bitch about it. AT ALL. It would be something no one person would even speak of, it would just be part of the game requirements, both on your system and mechanics; deal with it.

Secondly, this game isn't optimized yet. I can tell because its not even using hardly any of my CPU and GPU's power. Whether or not they'll address that, I don't know. It is not however, the grasses fault that you have 15 fps. For me, I get 60 fps in the middle of the forest on ultra, grass isn't my problem. Its the city, which my computer shutters down to 15 fps then back to 30-45 in the city. (My specs are 8120 4.5GHZ Radeon 6990)

Zombies should be a HUGE threat in a freaking **""ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME""** So please, stop the whining ""Zombies are impossible to kill"" or ""I can't kill two zombies are once"" Well maybe you shouldn't have grabbed there attention.

Also a final note, have you ever stopped and wondered that maybe melee weapons aren't the only thing that kill zombies. Maybe you should stop killing players with your bullets and start shooting zombies instead. Because you know, you all bitched about PVP. So. MAYBE... YOU KNOW... It'll bring down all the PKing everyone is so fed up with. 

**TL&amp;DR: Grass should always be there, its required now. Zombie buffs aren't set in stone, deal with it for now.**

Armed only with my trusty Jericho 9mm, I continued forward pretending I hadn't spotted him, and after breaking his line of sight behind a rock I crouched down and waited for him to get close.

And so he did. He came around the rock and I was ready. Bap bap bap bap! I probably used too much ammo, but I was a little on edge. He went down. Sifting through his stuff I realized the gun over his shoulder, a Mossberg, had no ammo. Oh well. He still seemed threatening, I didn't regret my actions.

Fast forward several minutes. I've made it to the city, and head towards the large apartment building/hotel. As I cross the street towards the front door, I hear the familiar sound of an irate zombie, and turn to see two following close behind me. I had my pistol out and didn't want to waste ammo, so I figured I'd lead them around a bit until it's safe to switch to my Spiked Bat (god damn them for not letting me have both equipped in my weapons slots!). I circle the building once and then head inside the door, and suddenly come face to face with another Survivor. With two zombies hot on my tail and this guy popping out of nowhere I didn't hesitate -- I let off 3 shots and he went down, then quickly took out my Spiked Bat and finished off the zombies. Turned out the poor guy didn't have a single weapon to his name, but he did have tons of supplies, which I desperately needed. I scarfed down some granola bars and a can of soup and continued on my way.

Several minutes later, still in the city, I hear several gunshots in the distance -- they sound close, not *too* close, but close enough I should worry about who's holding the weapon, and what he's shooting at (I'm guessing another player). So I go into Hunter mode, slowly and carefully moving towards the sounds of gunfire, crossing under the collapsed overpass and through a fence. I hear another shot. He's somewhere on the other side of the building I'm next to, across the street. I wait for signs of movement, watching both directions around the building.

Then I see him, running down the street without a care in the world. He sees something apparently, because he hops into the back of a truck and goes prone, and waits there, Mossberg out, watching down the street. 5 seconds later a Survivor comes around the corner and is shot down. He didn't have a gun, but did have a bat, and *was* headed right at the guy, so I guess the shooting was arguably justified. But I wasn't going to take any chances. He looted the body and then continued down the street, ducking through an auto shop and through a fence in the back towards the city. I followed.

Eventually he stopped, taking refuge behind some sandbags to take out his binoculars and scope the city out. So I strike. I come up behind him, pistol drawn, and put 3 into his back. He pops like a pinyata, a Mossberg, a Stanag mag, an MRE, assorted supplies, and a ridiculous number of backpacks. I take everything I need and leave, back up to the Safe Zone, my 20-minute action-packed scavenger trip complete.

Along the way I meet another Survivor just inside the Safe Zone. I stop and we chat a bit, I drop the empty Mossberg for him and wish him luck finding ammo, and in return he drops some 9mm ammo for me, and then we part ways.

Pretty fun game. I don't feel I was too overtly hostile. I saw threats and dealt with them, except that one guy in the hotel.. that was just a split-second reaction. Sorry to whoever it was. :)"	t5_2ujwe	True

1350885523.0	11vtyl	A Bandit's Tale. The Epitome	LoLOpulent	14	6	16	"So, I play on only one server, server 123. I'm pretty much the only real bandit on the server; I don't kill new-spawns unless I need food or they get too close and I don't camp safe-zones. My preferred way of killing is by setting traps: a group of loot dropped in the street, a clever lie in global chat, those kind of things.

Two days ago, a clan joins my server and starts talking about how they are bandit hunters, and how I am kill on sight. I loved this, the rush of hunting them , taking out their stragglers and hiding from the rest ( I'm playing solo ) is the best. However, i notice the next day that they are no longer on my server. Saddened by their lack of presence, which basically served to make me more of a threat on the server I look out to find their teamspeak. ( I used the teampeak search function, searched their clan name. )

I find the server and use a different nickname to log in, and a I make a new character on the server I found out they are now playing on. A couple guys ask me who I am, and I quickly told them that i was playing with them on server 123. I'm meet up with one of their squad leaders and a recruit and start running around with them, fighting zombies, protecting each other, and gaining their trust. I eventually ask why they left server 123 and found out that ""swag"" (my bandit's name) was too big of a problem so they found a new home server.

After a few hours of playing with them, they hand me a helmet that everyone in the clan is using and we head to the safezone north to meet up with another one of the clan and everyone's going to suit up with their best shit for a gaming sesh. I realize my chance to take everything is near. Once we get to the safezone everyone gears up and i start to get a little shaky, my bloods running and im thinking of when to strike. I'm only one person , with a shotgun and a pistol , they are three heavily armed guys, two with body armour.

The new guy we joined up with is the sniper, and has designated me as his backup while the other two go into the town. He's the most heavily armed and the scariest, so I'm elated to know I'm going to be ""watching"" his back. We leave the SafeZone and head south to quarry town, about half way there BAAAM. The sniper guy drops dead, and im confused as hell. Over teamspeak one of the players screams ""sorry sorry, it was an accident"". One of our four man group had accidentally blasted the sniper with 12 gauge slugs. I quickly realize as the other two and i stand over the dead body that I no longer have to worry about 3 guys turning on me, now its just me , and two extremely confused survivors. I pull up my Mossberg and end the one with body armour, one shot to the face. As i hear the other say ""what the fuck"" over teamspeak i point at him and end his life. Now sitting on the ground before me are two alice backpacks, more guns than i care to name and a two sets of body armour. I couldnt have made a better hual if i held pvp building in big city all day.

Once they quiet down in teamspeak i tell them calmly who i am, the bandit that harried their patrols on server 123, and issue them an invitation to come back to server 123 and reclaim their lost goods. The leader of the three replies by saying that ""Swag has more respect than that, he's a bandit, but he wouldnt do something this fucked up.""

In the end, I didn't even earn true recognition for the infiltration of their ranks. I did however earn a shitload of loot, and a 6 hour ban from their teamspeak. (Why the hell they didn't permaban me , i do not know. ) My brother will be playing the role of infiltrator next, and ill be following them as my bro lays out their positions and movements for me.

You can try it if you want to.

War Z have to be in window mode! 

The overlay only supports 1920x1080 and 1280x768 today. 

Start the application when you are in loading screen and there will be no problems with the overlay showing up without the map(if it does, just alt+tab, press enter once then press m and it will be restored) 

*The overlay will display when you open the map in War Z (m-key).

*§-key to open the console..

*Add a marker with the command: ""x y name"", e.g. 21 11 city (names can't contain the letter m).

*Delete a marker with the command: ""del name"", e.g del city(might not work properly atm).

*When you are done playing you can close the overlay with command: ""close"".

Placing markers that will stay to next session and more are coming in the next couple of days.

(Which makes me think they are on VOIP or something) Not taking any chances, (and being a ruthless PVPer anyway) I set up at the door with my pump shotgun.

They move to enter the building, with the guy with a pistol and shotgun leading. He gets a face full of buckshot before he even realizes I'm there, and goes down like a sack of bricks. The second one has a melee weapon, so he runs away. (I tag him with 2 body shots as he runs, though) A 3rd tries to enter, and he goes down in one shot too. I can't see the last guy, so I wait a bit and eventually decide to push out. I see him trying to use 3rd person to sneak up on me, so I walk over and execute him. (Since he had melee too) I then walk back in and start looting, but I only have 2 shots left in my shotgun.

As soon as I finish looting, but before I can equip any new firearms, a dude with a Saiga enters from the other side of the building and instantly opens fine. No idea where he came from, but I don't think he knew the 3. (Probably just heard the gunfire) I take two hits and return fire hitting him twice as well. He retreats out of the building, so I bandage and dive out of a window since I'm now out of ammo and down to just my hammer. (Since I don't want to dick around with my inventory at the moment)

I head to the end of the building and use 3rd person to watch him guard the door for a few seconds. Eventually he goes in, so I sprint around to get behind him and ""hammer out our differences."" He must have seen me, because as soon as I round the corner he comes back out and opens fire, scoring one more hit. (I bandage again, using my last one)

I dodge and weave like a madman, taking cover in a dark construction site a few meters away. We play a very tense game of hide and seek for a few minutes, but eventually he spots me and gets a few more shots off as I round a corner to take cover. I stick close to the corner and use 3rd person to see what he's gonna do.

I guess he smelled blood in the water, because he instantly sprints after me and rounds the corner pretty carelessly. I lay in to him with my hammer, and his brains are on the outside of his skull before he can fire again. (I know he had ammo because I looted him after) I look all of his shit, including a very large backpack and a kevlar helmet.

1350503204.0	11nad3	My favorite moment so far	TheRevTastic	22	15	14	"So for the past 3 hours today I have been playing the hell out of WarZ with a friend of mine that goes by kreesticlawk on twitter. Her and myself started out at the city near the construction site at the very bottom of the map.

We found enough water, food, bandages, and pain killers and antibiotics to last us for a good while. 

We decided to start trekking north as 90% of the zombies weren't moving due to a bug. 

Soon we came on to the place known as ""The Tunnel"" where we found chem lights and flares galore but no weapons in site. I really wanted a good gun by then.

Next we came up on the major city that is reachable on the current map. We check through building after building to find nothing that was of use to us. The last building we looked in though we found two pairs of binoculars, a Jericho 9mm pistol, and then on the very top floor a shotgun. The pistol had 13 shots and the shotgun had 8. No ammo was in sight.

We soon made our way to the small town that houses a big police station which was my main goal to get to, so you could imagine the excitement on my face. The next thing I realize though is there is another person in the town that is using the exact same clothing as my friend and also has a crossbow, the thing was, that person was wearing a cowboy hat. I decided to kill him to see if he had anything good on him. I fired all 13 rounds that I had and hit him maybe 8 times. I have no idea if he bleed out or if zombies got him but when I went around the back of the building he fleed to the 10% of zombies that were walking and working correctly chased me down. Soon I was dead as I had no ammo and only a spiked wooden bat to my name.

The next thing I know is that I'm off the server, with a grin on my face. Sure I was sad that I died but my friend disconnected and still has her shotgun and I still had an amazing time playing a game that is still in alpha."	t5_2ujwe	True

My group and I have reached the highest pinnacle of success.  Enough vehicles, weapons, and supplies stocked that dying means nothing to us.  We have gotten so bored that we have resorted to robbing survivors and only going for Bandit kills for entertainment.  The Arma 2 engine is a major limitation in the dayZ universe.  DayZ could so much more but yet the Arma engine will allow most ideas to NOT be implemented.  I still have high hopes for dayZ.  But after over 200 hrs of gameplay there is not much more for me to accomplish.  I want a game where there are fun side quests to complete such as : Find a dead zombie-fied FBI agent next to a crashed FBI SUV,  His gear reveals a small note saying where the presidents bunker was for that area, the note would reveal a few hints as to where the location was and the possible supplies to be found there (maybe even the president!).  It would be your choice to do the quest or continue on your way.  There wouldnt even be need for a quest log, you would simply carry the note with you, or destroy it in a fire if completed so if someone kills you they wont find the location (just an example).  Small quests can make this game never ending fun, something dayZ hasn't yet accomplished...  While i think 'The War Z' is a horrible name, if those are screen shots are legit then it looks great.  I want a zombie game where i need to look through cabinets and glove boxes to to loot stuff, not just walk in a market with trash and generic loot on the ground, that is no fun.

Seriously,I simply cannot accept that.Esp is like an ""addon"" right now.Its free,its unbannable,it is extremely useful and you can google it and download it in a Minute

Name 1 more PAYED GAME that this can happen.Google hacks and download them

Hammerpoint you are rediculous and you will be more rediculous if  the Punkbuster promised is not the original one

On his character screen you can see he owns the character Serpentt2, as seen in this picture: http://i.imgur.com/FaWHogN.png

Case closed. Another idiotic hacker trying to bluff his way out of a ban. He says that he DID ESP yet he couldn't have seen me and my pal from so far away without some hacks, as well as he states it in the present tense. 

On his topic of me saying he aimbotted me from a kilometer away I never said he killed me, I just said he was hitting me when I starting asking who was shooting me. The backstory is me and my pal were walking through the woods and all of a sudden we started getting hit. We took cover and even through binoculars we could BARELY see him he was so far away.

If you don't think Lockneedo was hacking, look at this: http://i.imgur.com/cL56Xy6.png

Look at SurvivalInstincts PvP videos. It's pretty obvious he hacks what with spinning around killing people as they come out of cover in the middle of the night and such.

Him saying that Lockneedo only hacked that one day is pretty stupid.

Next point, since the server files stuff (not a huge tech head) were released people have start formatting pretty awesome looking maps and improving the game greatly eg. cars, zombie reach and newer maps. I just want to ask why the devs don't embrace the situation and  see this as a push to give us what they promised from the start, if that happens then their servers wont be hacked again and hopefully the DDos attacks will stop too... But at the moment i am enjoying the game and unless something new comes out that catches my attention (new map) i will be looking forward to Dayz.."	t5_2ujwe	True

1355719417.0	14z7v4	The ban wave, the hackers, and the community	Bulvious	12	6	34	"First off, I'm pretty sure a lot of the bans that are ""99%"" accurate are not really accurate at all.

Not the whole point, but to begin with a shittily told story; after having a pretty fun fight in the Parkerville playground wherein my partner and I (mostly me) killed a group of four legitimately (first time using an Uzi, BAMF gun by the way,) they all complained in global about hackers. They said I was a hacker, that I had used wall hacks (noclip, I guess), and that I had aimbotted them to kill them all. The fight didn't last long honestly, and while they had plenty of time, they didn't return very many shots... Fact is, I was using an Uzi and then an M4 at approx 20- meters away, from the first fence of the Parkerville neighborhood shooting at them on the slide and shit. Killed one, backed off, had to kill some zombies, ran back out, shot at one, thought I got him, shot another one dead, ran, friend promptly told me I hadn't killed the guy and there was another... 

Firefight ended shortly after with them using AA12's from ineffective distances while I plugged away at them with SMG's and rifles. The result was four very angry kids, two full inventories, and a little debate wherein I told them I was sorry they felt the way they did and that they should play more to get better.

But this sort of had me thinking... As many of those bans weren't accurate, how many more people claim others are hackers inaccurately? It seems like hacking is blown way out of proportion by people that are bad and the fact that negative experiences are so much more memorable than positive ones. I've probably died to players 15 times on all my characters all told, and two of those were to the same hacker (went back just to verify on another charry, mossberg, you get the deal.)

People spout random numbers like 6/10 and 4/10 are hackers and things like that, but it seems like a far cry from reality. Seems like the dev's false ban wave reflects the communities' false accusations, resulting in the innocent being banned, which really seems worse than hacks themselves. I feel like it's a two way street being handled incorrectly by both sides. The hackers are the bad guys, and the community is fighting with itself and the devs while the devs fight the community and the hackers rather than bother sides working together on the hackers. Really just a bit of a rant.

tl;dr: lots of false bans in wave, lots of false accusations by community, lots of innocent people banned, everyone loses besides a chunk of hackers."	t5_2ujwe	True

1352732147.0	132bi3	Banditry: What is and isn't...	MortusX	19	14	20	"Now everyone is going to have their own definition of what makes a Bandit a Bandit.  I'm not here to argue that there's one preset definition, but some people wave around the term so loosely that it's starting to lose all meaning.  

The first thing we need to look at is where we're at.  It's a post apocalyptic world.  Zombies walk the earth.  Mass production of items is no longer an option.  Food stuffs are going bad.  So there's only one goal. Survive.  

Now what I find interesting is how many people think that if you're PK'd by someone, that they're automatically a bandit.  While this may be the case in some aspects, generally it's not true.  In a world where the ultimate goal is survival, people will do what is necessary.  If I'm starving and notice someone with a nice fat backpack strolling by, chances are they have what I need to continue surviving.  Now I could easily walk up to them and say ""Pardon me, but could you spare some food?"".  In some instances this may actually work.  Who knows, you could even form a partnership with that person.  But most of the time, these people who have a good deal of stuff in those packs are going to guard it fiercely.  They can't trust you, even if you look as though you have nothing at all on you.  What's to say you don't have a pistol shoved in your waist, and are waiting for them to turn around so you can off them?  So chances are they will either turn you away or kill you outright because you are an immediate threat to them.  Even if you don't have a weapon, you could easily start following them, which in the long run will be a danger to them as they don't know anything about you.  So if you have what I need to survive and I have the ability to, chances are I will end your life to continue my own existence.  I won't go out of my way to kill other players, and if I can actively avoid them I will do so, but if it's necessary to do I will do so unapologetically.

Is that banditry?  Well, depends on your definition.  The way I look at it, bandits are people who do not kill for survival.  They kill for the sport of it.  They have plenty of survival gear, their global inventory is stocked and ready to rock, and killing other survivors is of no benefit to them.  They kill for the joy of causing other people grief.  

So I want to see how other people define their Bandits.  Fire away.

I personally do not like it, I feel that the easy access to military rifles ruins the survival aspect for me, i would rather see no full autos (or at least make them so rare that almost nobody has one). 

IMO  the guns you should be able to find should be

Semi auto m4/ar15

Semi auto AKM

Single shot hunting rifles with occasional scopes (these would be your 
sniper rifles)

Shotguns

Handguns, lots and lots of handguns. 

and other things of this nature, the devs could walk into a gun store and pick civilian guns they think look cool for all i care, just stay away from full autos and stuff that almost no civilian owns.

Don't get me wrong, i don't mind the occasional m16 popping up, but having a m249 in a game like this is plain ridiculous.

1351338384.0	1264hg	Your most creative kills? Here's mine:	Monthral	15	10	18	"  While i'm walking through the big city on US 131 I give the supermarket a check for anything. I don't have a weapon (aside from a measly flashlight that i put away) and find that someone is already looting it and he has a pistol. He's nice enough to not kill me but is still very cautious towards me. He runs out of the supermarket and i hear some gun shots (pistol vs shotgun) and I don't know how he managed it but pistol guy survived leaving a nice score of loot there. I say ""Whatever you don't take I will"" and he stands there looking me up and down still being wary of me. He goes for the loot and grabs everything except for a lone hammer, so i grabbed it. Then he decided to chase me around with his newly found shotgun and I gave him a wide berth throughout the parking lot, which attracted a lot of zombies. I took the zombies and sprinted past him until they deaggroed and latched onto him. *bang* he took the bait he starts shooting the zombies with his shotgun but im pretty sure they're getting some hits into him, I come back around and start beating him in the back with the hammer he ""gave"" me as he was preoccupied with the zombies. We both ended up dieing in the end so I quickly grabbed one of my alts who was also in the big city and hauled ass back to the loot, weapons and ammo galore including a large backpack awaited me with no other survivor in sight.

1351158835.0	1224e3	How to Survive as a Survivor	wtfuggShane	14	7	9	"I've begun to notice that many players simply aren't good at this game. I don't say this to be condescending, but just to point out that I've run into a lot of people who blunder around in the middle of the street with no cover nearby, get killed, and then proceed to complain about bandits. They certainly don't live up to the lore's given reputation that we're all hardened survivors who have been battling zombies and what's left of humanity for the past five years.

Now, I'm not above killing another player if I see benefit in it but I never actively go looking for players to hunt down (it should go without saying that I also refuse to spawn camp or kill a player that clearly has nothing). Recently, though, I've come across some players that made it so ridiculously easy for me to take them out that I actually felt bad doing so. Not enough that it stopped my hammer, of course, but when a player is practically offering up his goods on a platter for you, it would be a mistake on your part not to take advantage of the opportunity.

Which made me wonder: if I'm not even trying to find players to kill and I continually encounter clueless survivors with no concept of self-preservation, is banditry really as big a problem as all the complaints would indicate? I've certainly had quite a few of my own characters die, but nowhere near enough that I thought PvP in this game was an issue. And then it occurred to me that maybe it's not bandits that are the issue, but rather survivors being oblivious to the metaphorical targets they paint on their chests with their actions.

Fact is, a bandit is only as dangerous as you let him be. A bandit relies on you making a mistake in order for his methods to be at all effective. I'd go so far as to say that 99% of the player deaths caused by other players were preventable. Yes, it's true that none of us are infallible and we inevitably will find ourselves in scenarios where the enemy player simply has the upper hand regardless of what we do, but that doesn't mean you can't make efforts to increase your average lifespan a bit.

So what I'm going to offer everyone is a bit of general advice that may seem like common sense but rarely seems to be practiced in apocalyptic Colorado:

- Camouflage. This is probably the biggest offender I've noticed. I don't care how cool you think your dude looks with his skull mask and orange vest that shows off his ripped triceps, it makes you highly noticeable and therefore puts you at more risk. If your character wears a white shirt and it's nighttime, you will be noticed. Likewise, the more skin your character is showing, the more reflective you are (sorry Vincent, Michelle). And I don't necessarily mean that we should all become Colorado rednecks and start wearing cammies, but sticking to muted colors-- greys, greens, browns --makes a world of difference. I can think of at least 5 times where I was moving directly within a character's cone of vision and they failed to notice me and soon after presented their spine to my hammer. Who knows how many times I've been unaware that I was in danger but avoided death by simply being less noticeable.

- Safety. Most players understand the concept of taking cover under fire reasonably well, but that seems to be the extent of safety practices I notice on a frequent basis. I'm talking really obvious stuff like traveling in a group with people you trust whenever possible, not jogging down the middle of the street, not silhouetting yourself against the outside wall of a building or fence, going prone whenever you're not moving. The best way to sum up the way you should be playing this game is to play it under the assumption that you are always being hunted by another player just out of your sight. Never assume you are safe and never fully trust someone you don't know. Sprint across the street towards the nearest cover, keep an ear out for footsteps, and, if you see proximity chat pop up, even if they are claiming to be friendly, it's probably not a bad idea to seriously consider vacating the area. If you notice several empty item spawns in a row, there's a good chance it means a player is nearby and that you should be extra cautious or even planning your exit. Never use guns on zombies unless the situation absolutely demands it and never try to melee more than one zombie at a time; if you aggro more than one zombie and have no friends nearby to help your best choice is to run, as this is much less likely to draw player attention to you than gunfire (zombie attention is the least of your concerns).


Notice I don't go into much detail about specific features of the game, as I'm normally not in the habit of giving advice to other players, but I feel like such general, basic strategy can only help make my own interactions with other players more interesting. At best, it may even help curb some of the (dare I say, unfounded) negative dismissals of a game I'm enjoying the hell out of, PvP and all.

So, yeah, get out there, play smarter, safer, have more fun. Maybe with a little situational awareness it'll be you getting the jump on the bandit next time. And for chrissake-- stop committing suicide by running down the middle of the road. 3am on a server with 5 players or not, you're practically begging to be put out of your self-created misery.

I cracked open a new character and went looting off in the boonies, avoiding bandits where I could. Eventually I came across a construction site, littered with hammers, bats, backpacks and binoculars. Binoculars. I'd never seen them before. They were a prize. I had to get to a safe zone. 


The town below me was peppered with infected, and I'd seen some scavengers darting through. I couldn't give them the pleasure. To the west was a climbing mountain range, but it looked like a path could be forged if one kept close to the cliffside. I trudge on, hugging the wall as near as I could, and keeping low. It went higher and higher, and eventually seemed impossible to pass. Sprint. Run. Spring Run. I kept at it until I found purchase, and continued on. It seemed I found a cliffside. I couldn't be seen, and no men were to be found on the highway. I risked a few short sprints / rest cycles and made my way to the south east encampment. 

Eventually, the road became impassable. Fuck. I thought I might be able to climb down, and slowly tried to make my way down the cliffside . Each leap hurt more and more, eventually weaking me to a dangerous level of health. I could still make it, but I couldn't survive so much as a clumsy swing from a flashlight. Still, the slope to the grass below me was shallow, I could easily walk down and-- bam. It was over. My inventory exploded from my expiring corpse as my body glitched through the rock. 

What the fuck was that. 

I loaded up and alt, found the old server, and made my way back. Pulling up the map, I guessed the most direct route I could from the encampment, and climbed up a ridge to access it. Suddenly I couldn't move. A game wall. I must have been on one before too, and wound up dying trying to get across it. 

No matter. I'm I was unarmed now. What did I have to lose? I jumped and ducked and prodded across the narrow ridge above the camp, attempting to break through. Eventually, through dumb luck, I made it to the other side. Wide open spaces and scattered trees. Clearly, I wasn't supposed to be here. Good enough. I used the open area to make a beeline for my downed items, eventually recovering them. Then, I made my way back to the edge of the save zone. Log out. Deposit.  

...and then I went back. The huge mountains beyond the gamewall begged to be explored. I made for the hills.

The hills are far less intimidating then they look. I learned very soon that what looked impassable was easily run up. Before long, I was on top of the world. I could see the city, dozens of trees, and some roads. I could see it all, and I could see nothing. Looking at the mountaintops in the distance, I found I could see below the skyline. White space. There was a void. 

I wonder what happens when I jump into it?  

Ten minutes later, I stood on the edge of oblivion. Do it. Jump. I did. I ...stopped. Frozen in air, I tried to back away from the wall of the gameworld. I didn't return to the ground. My character's head contorted. Eventually, I bugged my way back to a human shape. 

Okay fine. Another wall. 

I'll just have to find another entrance. 

...and that's how I got stuck between a mountainside cliff, and oblivion. Falling forever. 

I'm sorry, valiant world jumper alt. I'll have to delete you. But don't worry. I'll remake you. You'll be free to fuck up the game again, sometime soon. "	t5_2ujwe	True

-----------------------------
From Sergey--

PVP problem

Okay we all know that small amount of PVP is normal. PK on massive scale is bad. 

Here's few things to consider :

1) As we open more of the map space, there'll be much more harder to do pvp, since players won't see each other that often. 
2) In next few day we'll add feature that allows you to see on players list who's around you and what are their reputation. 


Those are ""natural steps"". But we want you guys to give us YOUR FEEDBACK - what do you think should be done to lower PK in a game. I mean - this is PVP game, so some level of violence and PK is expected. But we do not want it to be on massive scale, so we clearly need community help on this.


More ideas will be added as we're going thru your posts, we'll create voting survey which idea you like more after that.


IDEA 1: Militia force. Give good weapons, armor to GMs, let them patrol and provide protection. Recruit this force members from active players group. 

IDEA 2: PVE server option. PVP still can happen, but if you kill player with positive reputation you're getting kicked off server instantly.

1. Med kit 100% healing 30 second cooldown

3. Antibiotics ~40% healing 12 second cooldown

1370557801.0	1ftmyr	Anyone Feel Lockboxes should be Movable After X Amount of Time.	Deagle2013	9	4	10	"Anyone else like the option that lockboxes should be moved after an X period of time say two weeks to three weeks or something.

Reason for me saying this is because I had three lockboxes set up in the reddit private server. While yes I am an idiot for putting them into a private server, I feel as if I shouldn't lose something that costs GC for this. 

That's why I'm thinking maybe a feature where you could move it or something after a long period of time so yes, its stuck there for a while, but if something happens to the server you can at least get it out of there (While empty of course). Or maybe even an option to leave it in same spot but have it appear on a different server, I don't really know just something so it's not lost forever.

Just my opinion feel free to comment if you'd like.

EDIT: Just thought of another idea, I have no idea how to make this happen and I don't know if it is possible but like if a server shuts down, a lockbox placed there will be returned to the last player who used its GI. No idea how it could work but just something where it's not gone forever."	t5_2ujwe	True

These guys litterally miss about 90% of their shots (and I'm talking close range with shotguns missing in some cases).

I seriously feel like a hero every time I kill these people and you can literally take out a group of 3 spawn campers solo if you have an assault weapon and any skill at all.  My buddy even killed one of them with a Flashlight... when the dude had an M4!

Anyway, onto the main topic here:

What's the real truth behind this so-called ""Zombie Boss"" that supposedly has been spotted one time and supposedly documented to be killed by one person so far. There was even a facebook announcement on the person who killed it.

Here's the link to the Facebook Page as proof of this:

http://www.facebook.com/warzmmo/posts/302270796556901

From what my two friends have told me, they were in a server where one person did kill another one. They claim that they saw 10 people, most of them armed to the teeth with AA-12s and M16s. Apparently these guys ran into the thing and unloaded on it, but it just wouldn't go down. 9/10 people were supposedly killed, while the last one **finally** managed to unload on it and finish it off, and the server had an indicator on it saying ""(Insert Username Here) has killed the Super Zombie"" or something like that, and the chatbox then exploded with commotion over it. Again, this is all what I've been told.

Upon doing a lot of research on this matter, from what it seems, these Mutant Zombie Bosses are supposedly:

- He only comes out at night.
- Is very large; estimated to be about 8-10 ft.
- Only spawns for a limited amount of time and is UNBELIEVABLY RARE.
- Has a large hoard of normal zombies surrounding/following him.
- Discharges Green Goo of some kind.
- Takes a shitload of hits to kill.
- Drops Stem Cells when killed.
- Spawns on the tops of the cliffs surrounding the areas where you can hear him.

This map, created by another person who also tried to investigate this as well, claims to mark the areas in which he heard the Screaming/Howling Noise with Red, and a spot where he claims that one person his friend knew actually managed to find it before:

http://i.imgur.com/8O1xB.jpg

I've only been looking through this shit for one night, and already I'm mindfucked from all ends on all the shit I've been hearing about this. So I wanna know for real what the *real* truth behind this mystery is.

Is this ""Mutated Zombie Boss"" actually Real, and if so, where is the most probable spot one can find it and kill it? Or is it nothing but the Devs @ Hammerpoint trolling us by leading players on a Wild Goose Chase?"	t5_2ujwe	True

* The characters has been deleted on the player's account but not on the clans (They are currently invisible, taking slots impossible to kick them.)

* When someone enters your clan or give GC to the clan, you can't see it (the only way to refresh the clan page is to relaunch the game.)

* When you accept an application for your clan, the list of applications becomes empty (you have to switch tabs to restore it)

* The GC stored in the Clan Reserve isn't used when one buys slots for his clan (One's GC are used instead)

**IN GAME/INVENTORY**

* The Engine needs severe tweaking ! (FPS drop, freezing, glitches...) 

* The weight system isn't working on every characters (Some count Weight, some not.)

* When one's trying to change his backpack, the game isn't refreshed. A restart is needed to refresh 

* [Minor] An animations is cast when a player's zooming while crawling.

* Disconnecting takes way much time than 10 sec. 

* Sometimes, When a weapon is empty it isn't possible to reload.

* Relatively Often, when you kill other players and they drop loot, the game crashes. The same problem seems to occur with throwables. 

* When you equip a frag grenade in an action slot, it decompresses your game and chain crashes you upon login until you move it out of the action slot 

* Military Ruck - last row of slots becomes inaccessible once it has been filled with items (Only access by the menu inventory)

* Rifle Laser/Pistol Laser - Laser dot jumps around and ""snaps to"" certain portions of angled surfaces 

* When you're crouched and sometimes when proned if you open your map/inventory you will stand up 

* Flashlight shines through solid objects 

* Thrown into the sky when jumping while climbing surfaces. 

* If you have a weapon that can toggle from auto to semi and you pick up, or use one of you hot key items the gun toggles back to auto 

* Blinking barricade, which can cause FPS drops. 

* Some places deal fall damage but aren't steep enough to cause the player to fall.

* While in third person with the Kobra sight equipped, right clicking will take you instantly to first person.

* Sometimes, A model is invisible but there can be collision between it and the player.

* When throwing a flare or chemlight it freezes in the air, and illuminates where you stand. After a few seconds the light vanishes and appears at the spot where it landed.

I think they need to make the flashlight's light have a set distance (obviously much further during night time) and make it's space of origin not be as bright during the daytime. It's kind of ridiculous that I can see a dude on the outskirts of Campos with his Flashlight on when I'm in the 6 story apartment.

We cleared the airport and gathered a few melee weapons, an m16, and a mossberg as well as some survival gear and headed up to the top of the command tower on the runway. We knew good gear could be found there and when we finally reached the top, we were let down and only found a single bottle of water to quench our thirst. We decided that we would give the tower one more shot so we decided to server hop to another one of our favored servers to check if we could find anything there.

 Upon logging in on the new server we were immediately greeted to the sound of footsteps. Let it be known we do not kill for game but we kill to defend ourselves. There was a person on the inside of the command tower holding a shotgun, and with no hesitation my friend engaged him and the gun fight began. Seconds later, that player, and my friend were gunned down. I was pinned to the outside of the building and I could hear plenty of footsteps still inside the tower. It was like some sort of mexican standoff where me and the other player who killed my friend just waited in anticipation of each other running through the door. Let me also remind all of you that at this point, there was ATLEAST 7 to 8 bookbags on the ground in the top of that tower, and items everywhere. After a few minutes I notice one of the book bags on the ground move slightly. I had found my guy prone in all the items on the ground! He wasn't looking towards my direction so I decided to go all in and rush him through the window, and with a few shotgun shots later I had killed him. Bear in mind that during all of this I have the shakes like no other because I know the reward that will follow if I killed this player. At this point I feel like a king, with loot all over the floor. My friend who died at a character close by and was running to the tower that I was at during the gun fight. We both manage to start gathering the loot and it felt like being at a candy store where everything was ours. (The video link to my reaction of this can be found here. (will edit when off work)) While looting my friend ask me did you hear that? and boom someone respawned outside the tower and had now killed us!

 No way we were standing for this, so we relogged on yes, again new characters that were near the airport (we have lots of them) that had shotguns on them and decided to again attack the top of the airport tower. At this point it was all or nothing so we went full speed up to the top of the staircase and waited for about a minute or two to see if we could hear anything. The second we heard footsteps we rushed whoever was at the top of the tower from both sides. Turns out it was two players, decked in gear like no other. Luckily for us because of the split in direction they both looked at my friend to the left, where I flanked them from the right. And guess who now has the characters decked in gear like no other :) As soon as we killed them it was probably 4 in the morning and I had never felt more exhausted in my life. 

I have had great gaming moments but this one was like no other for me, and as you can see I was literally speechless due to the happiness that was rushing over me. And although this is just a game it does more to the player than most of you might know, that feeling you get when you finally feel like you have won is just something that I can't really explain but tried to do so with this post. None the less thank you WarZ and community for creating such a great atmosphere for moments just like this one.

Hours. I'm wondering if it is just for 'premium' members and if the drop rate dissapears if you are just a survivor?

I was basically looting low pop servers, mainly airstrip and the small settlements, went far south too. Really not a whole lot of issues, 
killed a few people scored some decent loot. 
When my clan came on we decided to join some high populated servers and do some pvp in Campos city. Literally every server that had 30+ people had blatant hackers. They were either glitching into the ground and killing people, or flying around and aimbotting us. We all died multiple times in this manner. 

There needs to be something done here by the devs. 
If people are flying around, killing people through the ground,
speed hacking, isn't there some kind of code that can be written into the game to instantly disconnect them from the servers?
Unless something like that is implemented I think I'm all set with this game until they introduce some kind of anti-hack program at Beta.
I know aimbotting and Esp shit won't ever go away, 
but I'd take that over people teleport hacking to rape you from across the map. I like my pvp, but my clan can't even enjoy that anymore. 
Sure we can play in low population servers where hackers tend not to lurk as much, but that also lowers our chances of running into any legit pvp too. Thoughts?"	t5_2ujwe	True

A guy was broadcasting about weapon trades on the global, maybe every 30 secs. Everyone is telling him to fuck off and nobody wanted to trade, but he kept at it. It was hard to chat because of his flooding, so I felt obligated to make him stop. I answered his trade request, saying i'd trade 2 Winchester mags (his request) for some stuff. I asked for an offer. He says, ""i have a SCAR! do u want that?"" I said, ""I don't know bud, sniper ammo's pretty rare..."" He goes, ""realy man i need these mags how about i throw in 2 xtra mags and a kobra???""  Score. I say,""Sure man, lemme make my way to east safety, meet you there."" I run through the city, grab a hammer and 2 granola bars on the way, the get up to the safe zone. I meet him there, and we go up the hill. Near the top, I tell him I have to unlog to grab my mags. He says hurry up and that he doesn't want someone else to be around to steal the trade items. I unlog and relog, not switching anything at all. I say, ""Go about 50 feet away, and we'll drop the stuff. I'll say 'go' after it's all been dropped, then we'll rush and pick up our stuff."" I drop my granola bars (aka mag decoys) and he drops the weapon and mags. We rush, and he says, ""Heey mann wtf these are granola bars u tricked me u fagot."" I say, ""Next time, don't floos the chat with useless ramblings, an update every few minutes is fine but not every 10 seconds."" I promptly logged out, letting him continue his silent rage.

1351296193.0	125gl2	Suggestion - Starvation &amp; dehydration decrease the maximum amount of health	Arcshine	13	7	9	"At the moment, if either the hunger or thirst meters are completely empty, you start losing health VERY slowly.

So slowly that it's easier to find a bandage and heal any damage you've taken rather than hunt for enough food or water to refill the meter.

Obviously this needs to be tweaked, but I don't think insta-death is the answer. I think when you are starving / dehydrated it should lower the MAXIMUM amount of health you can have. 

For example, if you starved for 1 day (game time), it would reduce your maximum health to 50%. Meaning no matter how many bandages / antibiotics you use, you will never go past 50% health unless you refill the hunger meter to a certain level.

Just slightly increase the rate at which it it currently depletes, and this would be a great motivator to make sure you have sufficient supplies. Plus it would discourage camping for extended periods of time.

After waiting for about 5 mins I decided to leave the roof and check the car, obtaining myself a SIG. Then out of nowhere I hear sniper shots coming from the street. As I was panicking I quikly ran to the other side of the wall behind the restaurant as my friends were yelling about getting shot at. After my two friends died on top of the roof, I turned behind the corner and saw a guy with a sniper looting my friends body near one of the cars. I quickly dispatched him with my pistol and had an orgasm when I found the sniper rifle he had - and picked it up. Then being the coward I am, I ran back behind the wall, got shot at by ANOTHER terrible sniper behind me and took out the sniper rifle I had. As I approached the other side of the wall, I turned the corner and missed a zoomed in sniper shot because the adrenaline rush I had. He popped out of the corner tried to quickscope me and failed horribly, giving me an opportunity to take out my pistol and end his life. After climaxing about the other sniper rifle he had, I looked behind me and there was a 5-man group standing on top of the car without weapons like retards. Instinctively, I took out my sniper, shot one of the dumbasses and found a little shack to where I can safely log and save one of the sniper rifles for my buddies the following day(because it was getting really late and there was school).

1350852156.0	11uyk4	Personal game ideas, suggestions and general feedback.	CrowClaw	9	2	2	"Please take these ideas with a grain of salt as they are creative suggestions from a traditional MMO perspective
i don't know if these have been already suggested but here they are

Future Game ideas:
Alternating weather effects: Rain, lightning, thunder, fog, moving clouds – added immersion. A day and month system is currently within the game, maybe they could also reflect the time of season aswell?

PvE incentivising is a MUST
Lootable zombies, perhaps different types of zombies with different rarities to allow players a reason to hunt rarer zombies for better loot. (special zombies such as: military, policeman, fireman) At the moment players have a huge incentive to kill other players as the reward of looting players is most satisfying. Possible boss zombies, going back to traditional mmo styles with a chance to drop unique loot. At the moment server hopping is a detriment to gameplay as it provides a huge advantage to those who abuse it. Allowing zombies to drop loot would help eliminate this factor.

Killing zombies could reward players with experience also, think of them as general trash mobs in traditional mmos. Players who don’t kill them would be at a disadvantage to those who do kill them.
Possible roaming zombies, more, more, more zombies! I want to be fearing for my life and never feel safe from them 
Player titles and name plates. I know that the devs plan to incorporate nameplates, but I would love to see titles next to their name while in-game. The title could progressively become better through earning different achievements. These titles would be suited towards the players alignment.

Visible ping and current server information on pause screen or on TAB.
There is currently a problem where some loot is unreachable, I am not sure how this could be fixable but it is a problem in it’s currently state.
Please eliminate players from being able to turn off terrain decorations as it provides a huge advantage to those who abuse it. I know that it requires a lot of rendering power and may become a detriment with low spec computers, but you must draw the line somewhere.

Traditional mmo /commands such as /invite and /whisper “playername”. I know that you guys will incorporate a friends list and have the idea to expand clan team play, but I think if players could interact with each other on a personal level from a distance it might encourage team play. Possible Server wide group chat with name frames and player health bars.
The ability to control each aspects of the audio, but on a personal level I love the general ambience as it adds heavy immersion to the environment. (just to satisfy players who hate it) I still don’t think it should be able to be turned off just lowered.

Hunting for food would be a nice addition to the game play. But perhaps something like this is already in the works. Campfire creation etc. Fishing would be AWESOME.
Possible water canteens? Don’t want to copy ‘you know what’ to much though 
Provide cool downs or animations which require the player to stand still when applying bandages or taking pills, at the moment players can pretty much spam use these items while taking damage, even if you added the cast bar type feature when using the items on yourself.

Perhaps some crafting elements? We can only dream. I am not going to touch on this to much as this is a very big thing to ask for but I guess players could smelt down duplicate weapons for scrap to build items such as wire fences and other items which offer utility.

Give players the ability to unlock the camera, I am not sure if this is already in the game. If it is, it’s not very easy to find. I feel that whilst running from zombies, having the ability to run away and look at them would be ideal as having to turn around to look at them allows them to gain additional ground. (possible suggestion)

Being new spawns, we were all freindly and decided to party up. We head northward to a town and decide to loot. In the town, however, there wer three more guys. They were newspawns too, so we increase our group. We agree to start a skype call and we start looting.
After looting the town and finding a Jericho (which they let me keep), three guys spawn in. These guys were not newspawns, they were bandits that wanted everything they could find. Seeing these guys, I alert my group and throw a flare at them and start firing. I drop two as my clip runs dry and two friendlies jump the last guy with flashlights. Loot spills like confetti, and we reep the rewards. We managed to collect five shotguns and three B92s. Little did we know, three more guys spawned north the map and three guys south.
As we are about to leave the town, we go to the diner and plan. Outside, we hear shots. These two groups started a huge firefight in the town, and we were stuck in the cross-fire. After about thirty seconds, the shots stop and we see two guys run past the diner. Our group, being smart, jumped out of the diner and shot these guys up. We collected a ton of loot including two Mausers and enough food to keep the world fed for years.
