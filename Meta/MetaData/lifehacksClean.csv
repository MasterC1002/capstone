Keeping an open box in your car, under you seat accomplishes two things: 

1) Your car will always smell nice and crisp, without being obnoxious.

2) If you smoke, smell like the restaurant you just ate at, or just need a freshness pick-up, you can take one out of the box and rub it all over your clothes for a freshly laundered smell.

It's much cheaper, easier, and longer lasting than car air fresheners and Febreeze.

Whenever I think something like *""how does gravity work""* or *""I want to read that book""* or *""I wonder if this Breaking Bad show is any good""* or *""I should lean to dress better""* I type it onto a list on my cellphone or tablet.

As a result of that stress, I get mouth ulcers. Those pesky, painful, annoying ulcers, that are common, but often result in me not being able to eat, and are simply a nuisance to my life.

A few days ago, in a last attempt to solve this recurring ulcer situation, I started reading on them.
Ulcers can be caused by a calcium deficiency, and dentists would apply a simple product over one to coat it, and help stop irritation and pain. Obviously, acidity plays a huge role in causing them as well…

As I kept reading, the idea struck me: 
Take a Tums tablet, place it on the ulcer and let it dissolve.

This might seem like a grand-mother recipe, but trust me when I say, that after dissolving one TUMS supplement, and a good night sleep, the ulcer that normally would take DAYS to heal is no longer painful, and much less inflamed, and on its way to a very speedy recovery.

tl;dr: Place a Tums on the ulcer in your mouth, allow to dissolve. The pain will be gone in no time, and the ulcer will be gone must faster than normal.

1355664659.0	14xvkf	How to Wake Up Immediately	redmaniacs	1361	507	189	"So here's how I manage to wake up everyday ready to go everyday.  

Whenever it is you have to wake up most days. Wake up at that time EVERY DAY. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you have to wake up at 5:30 to get to work five days a week. You wake up at 5:30 weekends and holidays to. If you're a student you have to get up at 7:00 to make it to classes. Set your alarm for 7:00 every day.   

As soon as the alarm goes off. Get out of bed, turn the alarm off, turn the lights on and start getting dressed. Do not go back to bed; do not close your eyes. This is fairly difficult the first few days/weeks, but eventually your body gets used to this and you get moving much quicker.   

On holidays and weekends when you don't have to be out the door as early, get up at the normal time. Stay awake for around five minutes, so you are fully awake. And go back to bed. Two things happen when you do this:  

1) Your body is still in the mode of waking up early every day, so it's still easy to get out of bed for work Monday.   
2) Your brain is super awake and you dream a lot. Very, weird.    

Obviously if you have an early flight to catch or you have an earlier event, you need to get up earlier, but if you catch up on your sleep correctly this won't affect your sleep cycle too much.   

Also whenever possible, sleep in multiples of 90 minutes. Your body has 90 minute REM cycles and if you wake up at the end of the cycles instead of the middle, you will feel more rested.   


**EDIT:** Yeah I know that it sounds like ""If you want to wake up, then just wake up"", but the point is if you do this EVERY DAY, it becomes easier to get up."	t5_2qj5n	True

Using a raspberry pi, some clever coding, and some help from a member of the web team, we were able to create real time monitoring of our coffee pots.

Every time somebody brews a new pot and places it on the sensor, the pi detects this and updates the webpage. It also detects the level of the coffee and keeps track of how fresh it is during the day via steam lines. Depending on the state of the coffee, the emotes on the pots change from super happy to sad.

Later on we plan to add analytics to track usage patterns and an email subscription page so users can be notified when a brew is ready.

1365734319.0	1c6jfb	When parking your car on a hill, put the car in neutral, set the emergency brake, then put the car in park (or in gear). This puts the weight of the car on the emergency brake rather than the transmission and can extend the life of your transmission.	The_Comma_Splicer	1000	243	147	"You should put it in neutral, apply the e-brake while braking, and then slowly take you foot off the brake and feel the e-brake ""catch"" the weight of the car. Then you can put it in park/gear and be sure that there isn't any torque needlessly being applied to the transmission. 

This process is especially important if you park on an incline/decline every day. 

In similar fashion, don't put the car in park while it's still rolling and use the transmission to stop you. This is also bad for your transmission.

As a result when in your mouth, tipping your head back actually moves the pills to the front of your mouth, making you feel the pills as they go down, which is primarily the most uncomfortable part about taking pills.

As a result, tip your head forward, this moves the pills to be back of your mouth, and helps disguise the feeling of the pills going down.  

I also use my tongue as a way to push all the liquid back at once, which gives you as much liquid as possible around the pill as it goes down.  

I have to say its a bit odd to have to examine my pill taking process so thoroughly, but I wanted to share in case anyone has an issue taking pills.

Edit:  
From [learn2fall](http://www.reddit.com/user/learn2fall) 

&gt;The actual reason this works is because bringing your chin to your chest 'closes' the part of your throat which is dedicated to breathing(larynx) and 'opens' the part for swallowing (esophagus).
&gt;This is also why when doing CPR you tilt the person's head back - to open the larynx and allow air passage rather than simply blow air into the stomach.

I go to school in southern Alabama and it's ridiculously humid. The dorm was built with a motion sensor that triggered the A/C unit in the room. I was sick of getting back to a hot/humid room every day and waiting 30-45 minutes for the room to cool down, so I rigged this thing. It kept my room at 65 degrees the entire semester.

It's made out of a clock kit that I bought from hobby lobby, and a cut up playing card. Affixed with velcro and wall hooks.

Toothpaste contains diatomaceous earth, which is a calcium compound made from the ground up skeletons of animals with hard shells, making it abrasive. On a molecular scale, DE looks like spiky cones! Most all toothpaste contains eucalyptus, which is a natural pain reviler and astringent. This list only works with non gel tooth paste.

Use toothpaste to:

Make your headlights looks brand new! Oxidation gives your headlights a murky yellow look. Scrub some non gel toothpaste on your headlights and have them looking like new in no time!

Use to hang posters! Makes a great cement that wont damage drywall! 

Have smelly hands or feet? Rub some toothpaste over then! Not only will the abrasive free any stinky particles, but the eucalyptus will sooth tired feet.

Stinky baby bottles or water bottles or containers? scrub em down with toothpaste! Works especially well with plastics! Or and, you know how your Tupperware gets discolored? Restore them with toothpaste!

Have a scratched CD? rub a little toothpaste and water over the cd and lightly buff! same goes with scratchy watch surfaces! 

Have a nasty stain on your shirt? Rub toothpaste on it and wash!

Dirty sneakers? TOOTHPASTE!

Cleaning silver? Diamond jewelry? TOOTHPASTE!

have a minor burn and no open wounds? Have a hickey? The eucalyptus will not only sooth the burn but will decrease the redness. Dab some on a portion of skin and let it sit for an hour. Repeat the next day if its still red!

Hate itchy mosquito bites? Dab some toothpaste on it and forget it. no itching!

Have rough, dull nails? buff them with toothpaste and be amazed at the shine! 

Have a ring in your toilet, bath or sink? no need for comet! Scrub that shit with toothpaste and have a minty shit hole!

You know how you were told to spit into your swimming goggles to keep the fog away? Remember how that works for the first ten minutes? rub toothpaste on the interior of the goggles, creating a silky smooth surface and be fog free for a long time!

Remove scratches from glassware. 

Use it to clean your clothing iron!

Lightly buff your furniture to remove water rings!

As toothpaste contains Diatomaceous earth, (aka sharp spiky cones), it is mildly abrasive, but to insects its like a bramble bush. Use this shit in the garden and lightly coat your prized veggies, or make a ground barrier.

In my last trip to visit him, he gave me the key to the universe; the scientific way to get rid of the hiccups every time. I have never had it fail, and it always gets rid of the hiccups. 

Today I share with you his ancient secret.

1. Fill your lungs with your mouth. Very important you use the mouth.
2. Swallow TWICE in a row. If you have difficulty doing this generate saliva in your mouth, it'll help you get the second swallow easier.
3. Exhale SLOWLY through your nostrils.

Anyone have any hints? Our house looks like a crime scene :(

Update:
Hydrogen peroxide takes the prize- once I thought to take the scrubber out of my carpet cleaner and got into a rhythm of soak, resoak, vacuum, soak again and revacuum, it started coming along quite nicely.

2. Submerge the can in water (i put it on the side so it could roll and get even heat)
4. Make sure the water covers the can totally
5. leave at a very low boil for 3-4 hours and **make sure to top off the water** so its covering the whole can
6. take the can out and leave it to cool for a few hours

now you have an amazing caramel spread - i tried it on bread already and i was in heaven

***Pro Version***

instead of cooking it in the can you can use a jelly/marmalade jar or a mason jar

just fill the jar with condensed milk and screw the lid on, not too tight but not too loose

again leave to boil and check up on it

after 3-4 hours before cooling off, open the jar and let the excess air out and close it again, now when it cools it will form a vacuum and it can keep in the jar unopened for about 3 months without refrigerating

***with a ribbon around it it makes for a good cheap Christmas present***

This might be more of a tip than a lifehack - but let me know and ill see if i can find another sub to share it on :)

Let's say you have a word document, in this case you have completed it in 10 pages, and you want to make it seem even longer. For this trick, the longer the original text is, the more pages you will increase it by.

A common font and font size standard used by teachers is Times New Roman size 12. It would be obvious if you changed that. So here's what you do:

Find the ""search and replace"" tool in word/staroffice/whatever you use. Search for all dots and commas and replaces them with a new dot/comma in size 14. It's not noticable to the eye, but each dot and comma in a bigger font size adds a slightly bigger gap, thus extending the entire text into more pages. Therefore it works better with the more text you've got. More text = more dots and commas = more bigger sized dots and commas for increased space uptaking.

So, again. Search for ""."" and replace  with ""."" with font size 14 (if you're writing the paper in size 12), and later the the same with "","".

1333492381.0	rrw2m	How to learn a language efficiently (and quickly) (x/post)	gwyner	352	51	68	"I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:





* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for Japanese or Pinyin for Chinese, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed.
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate (Exception to no English rule - just be careful there's no English in your Anki deck) and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything double-checked at lang-8.com before putting them into my Anki deck.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, but without too many grammar or vocab holes) and write about most familiar things, I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

One day I took my father's power drill and made a small hole in the floor at a slight angle just in front of my bedroom door inside my room. When I needed some privacy I would drop any old screwdriver into the hole to prevent the door from flying open. The carpet was thick enough to cover the hole.

DOS!!
1. Stop eating so much junk food, that's why your broke and fat.
2. Take the money you save from being a fatty and invest in a gym membership
3. Actually use that nice gym membership and go at least 3 times a week minimum.
4. Stop complaining at work and just get it done, you're getting paid after all so just look at the positives
5. Work as much as possible! You have nothing else to do.
6. Limit the amount you smoke so you save money....and the high is like pie in the sky when you don't consume as much.
7. Start saving money for emergencies or just out of good habit, that money could help you eventually (start with $10 a pay check and see how far you get)
8. Once you start making good money, pay off all debts to people so you can feel all fuzzy on the inside.
9. Once debts are paid off start looking for your own place, quit living in people's basements!!!!
10. Profit?????

DONTS
1. Do not eat after 10pm unless you somehow end up at a breakfast joint, it's literally impossible to avoid grubbing when it's breakfast
2. If you do wind up at a breakfast place, don't end up there more than 3 times in a month
2. Don't puss out about going to the gym or working out, for every time you do, you must put $5 in the fatty jar.
3. Do not slack off at work, that's what after work is for
4. Do not do anything that would jeopardize your job(s) like: calling in excessively, no call no shows, mouthing off to the boss man, slapping the shit out of customers no matter how stupid they are.
5. Do not spend money you do not have!! 
6. Do not spend the last of your money, food will not make you happier about being broke.
7. Don't spend your check when you first get it, give it a few days and try to really think about whether you need what you are currently wanting.
8. Don't give up after a week of doing this, even after a week of trying this I can bet your life will have improved.
9. Don't ignore people, just be as honest with them as you would like them to be to you."	t5_2qj5n	True

Shop around online. By doing this, you can easily get the lowest prices. However, you also have to read the fine print. Some dealerships will offer you an amazing online price, but they may also include incentives and rebates you may not qualify for. Not everyone is a recent college grad, or active duty military. Please read the fine print. 
If you are looking for a specific new vehicle, do not hesitate to utilize the manufacturer's website. Try the ""build your own"" feature. This will give you an idea of what your realistic car will cost you. If you submit this vehicle, it will go to the nearest dealership, which may or may not have that vehicle in stock. You do not have to settle. 
When you have decided on a new vehicle, do not hesitate to call that local dealership, and ask for ""Matrix Pricing"". Every dealership has matrix pricing which gives a percentage off the MSRP.

Know your credit score:
This is a major issue. I understand bad things happen to good people, I have sympathy for most. You have to understand what your buying power is. Car dealerships mostly use equifax, and we can multi-credit to transunion to see if we can boost your credit score. This is only if you are above a 609. The higher your score, the better your interest rate will be for obvious reasons. If you have credit issues, please bring a co-signer that has a decent credit score, and a decent amount of income-to-debt ration. 
If you are unsure of your credit, most name-brand dealerships (ABC Ford, XYZ Toyota) will have a credit application link, that will let you know what your credit score is.

Trade-in:
If you are still financing a vehicle you plan to trade-in, you may carry some negative equity over. This means you are paying more for the vehicle than what it is worth. To find out the difference, please call your financial institution, and ask for a ""10 Day Payoff"". Then utilize websites such as Autotrader.com , to see roughly what your vehicle is worth. I use the term ""roughly"", due to the fact that your vehicle may be worth more. 
Before you utilize a website like autotrader, keep in mind, that you have to be honest with that information, other wise the number that is produced will be unrealistic. Look at your possible trade-in, and pretend that you are buying it from yourself. Annotate any damage, (nicks, scratches, dents, dings, etc). If you fail to do so, the dealership will find them, when you bring it in to seal the deal. Yes it may be true that you can get more money for it selling it yourself, but time may be the biggest factor. The longer you have it in your possession, the more it can depreciate.

Going to the dealership:
It is best to set-up an appointment. If you are unsure what salesman to work with, use a website called Dealerrater.com. This way, you can see what kind of salesman you have the options of working with. Look at how many reviews + the quality that salesman has received. If you are shopping around for a car, you can pick your own salesman.
Keep in mind you are in control, from the moment you walk into the dealership. You don't have to let a salesman control the situation. If you feel uncomfortable, you can move on to someone else, or walk away at anytime. I will let you know, that your salesman, has scripts, like an actor. We have rehearsed these lines, and we have had training on them. 

If you have followed the previous steps, the rest should be fairly easy. Once you have located the vehicle that you want, ask everything that is important to you. This is what they call the presentation part. The salesman will figure out what your ""hot buttons"" are, and go over those key features to try to impress you. This is called the ""Wow factor"". 
Feel free to test drive the vehicle. This is usually a 10 minute ordeal. If you need more time, speak up!!

After the test drive, you should be shown the service department. This is a good thing,especially if you are entitled to free maintenance.
The salesman would most likely do some paperwork. If you have already done your research, and found the vehicle you want to purchase, please by all means, let him/her proceed. This is where everything comes together. You can explain that you have already received the matrix pricing. This cuts negotiation, of the vehicle. If you have negative equity, that will be added to your new loan. This means if you were looking at a $10,000 vehicle, and have $5,000 negative equity, the vehicle you are trying to purchase just went to $15,000. When you see your interest rate, you may be able to negotiate it by a half point, or by a point. This is depending on your credit as well as any negative equity. If you have negative equity, please have a down payment.  I have seen many people with ""not so good credit"", try to negotiate, and they had to leave upset. If you want gap insurance, you can ask to have it added, or if you want an additional warranty, you can have it included. **You can negotiate these prices**. 
The dealership may bring out a ""closer"", someone who may try to get you to buy the car that day. 

If you are within your budget after all this is said and done, you can easily sign the paperwork committing to it.  If the vehicle you are looking at does not suit your needs, do not let the paperwork commence! If you are unsure of buying that vehicle that day, you can tell the dealership that you will not buy today, but tomorrow. Never lose control. 

Finance:
When you speak to the finance manager, they will discuss cosmetic protection, vehicle service agreements, as well as gap insurance. You can easily negotiate these terms. It is best to negotiate these with the finance manager, due to the fact that there is no longer a ""middle-man""

 



Also:
Statistically, 85% of women in a relationship have the buying power. Salesman are now trained to engage the woman in a conversation about the vehicle vice the traditional male counterpart. Also, if you bring someone with you, that is not going to be your co-signer, be careful of what they say. It can ruin your deal. If they have concerns, they can voice them to you, just ask the salesman to leave for a minute. 

I hope this helps all of you. The reason for this post, is that not all of us car salesmen &amp; women are bad people. We prefer to be more of a customer service type, rather than a salesman. We would rather be your friend, than your enemy. I would rather make a little bit of money off of you ($100), and you refer your friends and family, and I can do the same for them. Word of mouth travels faster than any advertising I could ever do. 
 
With that said, yes I make commission. I get about 20% off of the gross profit from the dealership. Yes, I have a quota. But I can only do that by selling units, (vehicles). The more I sell, (regardless of gross profit) the better my paycheck is. Also, I am located in Virginia, if you want more information PM me, and I will answer all questions you may have. Please be kind to me, since I have given you the full insight to my job.

EDIT: TL;DR  Do your research, set yourself up for success, it will you save time and thousands of dollars

You finished reading the page, yet you still have 15 minutes to go! These minimums are often imposed so that online school is not faster than regular. You are still in class for the same amount of time. These are usually on online high school websites or online driving classes and generally work on simply designed HTML pages (Most online schools).

**Here's the trick**:

In Chrome or Firefox press F12 on your class' page. Press the ""console"" button. Type:

checkNext();

Press enter.

If it comes back **true** then you're all set! The page thinks you spent the minimum time on it!

If it comes back **false**:

Shirt off is just to cool off the body. 
If you're in public and in excruciating pain pull the rim of your pants pressing against your stomach off. just put a thumb in and pull it off, give your stomach some breathing room.

You simply take a spring, twist your wire into it, and heat-shrink. I recommend pen springs for headphones and phone chargers. To brace a power-cord go to Home Depot or any hardware store and look for springs. They will have springs of all sizes. You preferably want one that can fit partially onto the base of the charging plug. The heat-shrink should be on both the wire and the charging plug. Use black or white heat shrink to achieve a seamless looking fix. I used red so it was easy to see. 

If you absolutely cannot find a spring, you can make a wire alternative. Simply take around 24 gauge wire and wrap it around the charging plug/wire area. Heat shrink and you will have the same resilience. You can also forgo the spring concept entirely and just use heat-shrink. 

The spring alleviates stress and makes it impossible to bend at the connection joint. The heat-shrink adds a stiff 'jacket' of sorts that also prevents the spring from sliding down the length of the wire.

I took the remote apart and tried changing the battery but that didn't improve the problem.

I determined that the conductive paint on the bottom of the buttons had been rubbed off, so I needed something to replace it. I wound up using an x-acto knife and an old TV remote that we didn't use (you could also use an old calculator).

I cut off out a button from the rubber pad on the TV remote, shaved off the conductive material while leaving a bit of the rubber, and used silicone glue to stick it over the old pad on my car's remote.

I found it works best to put a very small amount of glue on your car's remote keypad using a toothpick, and then place the shaved off conductive spot on using tweezers.

DeepUpTheAHoleFranko	169	30	35	"So I was sitting in first class and given a little white steamed wash cloth. I couldn't get over how wonderful something so simple made me feel. I was refreshed, and it took such little effort. So I decided to expand on this whole wash cloth thing, and what I found has truly changed my life and hopefully it can change yours too.

I purchased 24 white wash cloths from Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/1888-Mills-Cloths-Commercial-Quality/dp/B001J1Y9RO

Each day I bring one of these cloths to work, and about 3/4 into my work day I head into the break room.
Run the towel under hot water, and put it into the microwave in a zip-lock bag (not zipped shut) for 60 seconds.

I would then head into the bathroom and give my genitals a complete wash down. You have NO IDEA how refreshed you feel after doing this.  Just giving your frank and beans (or im sure vagina) a complete steamed hot towel wash down will reinvigorate your entire day!

Afterwards, I put it back in the zip-lock for transport home for a wash. I repeat this process everyday and I haven't looked back since.  Let me know if this works for anyone else, if so glad to have helped a fellow redditor!

Most people don't know you can often go one, and sometimes even two, zoom level(s) deeper than Google Maps' little +/- magnification slider wants to let you.

Start by going to somewhere on Google Maps, say, http://goo.gl/maps/t4sph

Zoom in as far as it will let you by clicking on the ""+"" sign at the top of the magnification slider at the top left of the map.

When you're in as far as you can go (heh) but not all the way to street view (if the location you're looking at even has street view), look over at the white space just to the top left of the map....where the little printer and chain link buttons are.

Click on the chain ""link"" button. That will show you a box with a long URL to the map you are looking at and another box with some HTML code to embed. Ignore the HTML code.

Copy the long URL and paste it into your browser's address bar, but don't hit enter to go to that URL yet. Instead, click to edit it and scroll all the way to the right. It should end with something like ""&amp;z=22"". 

Change the 22 to 23 (""&amp;z=23"") (or 21 to 22...basically just add 1 to whatever you see) and hit enter. If Google Maps has imagery at that higher zoom level, it will show it to you.  You can continue incrementing until Google doesn't have imagery at the higher zoom levels.

This can be fun in cities -- they have some really high-resolution shots sometimes that they don't show you by default.

Here's what you get with the above location -- a zoom level that you can't get to normally by using Google's +/- slider: http://goo.gl/maps/Bk9uh"	t5_2qj5n	True

If you have ever experienced to get some kind of paint on your skin, then you know how annoying it can be to get it off afterwards.
A simple trick to easily get it off, is to use olive oil. Just take a small portion of the oil on your fingers and wipe over the area on your skin where the paint is. You will see that the paint will easily drain away with the use of water. This is much more healthy to your skin then it is with the use of for example White spirit or paint thinner.

Most people put the neck pillow on the ""right"" way, but fail to realize that the optimal way of supporting your neck and preventing cramps during long travel periods is to place it so the opening of a neck pillow is facing behind you.

When you wear the pillow with the opening oriented to the front of your neck, you are actually making it easier for your head to lull forward because of the support of the pillow+the head rest of the seat.  That slump is a common reason for neck pain.

Instead, by facing the pillow so the opening is around your spine, then your chin will rest on the pillow, keeping your head from falling forward, and the head rest will obviously keep your head from going too far back.

BoomboxAssassin	122	23	35	"Put a mixture of water, Dawn dishwashing liquid (about a teaspoon per 20 ounces of water), and a splash of peppermint oil (which acts as a repellant) into a squirt bottle (or a supersoaker) and set the nozzle to jet.  It's non-toxic, so instead of killing them by poisoning them, it coats their bodies in soapy film.  This makes them too heavy to fly and then suffocates them.  The fact that it's non-toxic makes it better for the environment and safe to use around plants and animals.

I found out about this last night while trying to figure out what to do with a wasp nest over my front door.  I wanted to get rid of the thing ASAP because wasps are basically God's worst mistake, but I didn't have any Raid or anything in the house, and fire was unfortunately not an option due to the house attached to the nest and all.  I tried this as a last-ditch effort and to my surprise, it actually killed them about as quickly and effectively as the commercial sprays do.  There were about ten of them chilling on the nest last night, and now my front steps look like the aftermath of some kind of crazy epic wasp battle.

Obligatory disclaimer warning thing: If you're going to shoot this stuff at wasp nests, do so at your own risk.  You might still get stung anyway.  Try to engage the nest late at night when the wasps are inactive and you can catch them off guard.  Speaking from experience, it works great on those little paper honeycomb nests, but I'd probably get a professional for anything more serious like yellow jackets or hornets.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, I do know a cheap, green, homemade way to get rid of yellow jacket nests.

Yellow jackets usually build their nests underground, and go in and out through a small hole.  If you can find this hole, go out there during the evening and put an inverted pyrex salad bowl over it.  Pack dirt or sand around the edge of the bowl and make sure it's good and sealed.  Go ahead and put like a brick or something on top of it to weigh it down if it makes you feel better to do so.  Leave it like that for two weeks, just to be absolutely sure.  Being able to see the sun tricks them into thinking they're out of the nest, so they won't think to dig another way out, and they'll eventually starve like that.

After drinking from your bottle, squeeze the sides to compress the bottle and expel the air before you close the top. This way the pressure inside the bottle is less than atmospheric pressure and thus, if the bottle tips over inside your bag, instead of water leaking out, air will leak in.
Hopefully the rate of air leakage will be slow enough so that by the time you get your bottle out again, it will still be slightly compressed and your bag will be dry."	t5_2qj5n	True

Not only does it almost completely stop bleeding in most cases, turmeric is a natural anti-septic and anti-biotic.

The kitchen I work in now does a lot of baking, and the bakers use egg whites when they accidently burn themselves. I tried this myself, and can attest to its efficacy! I burned myself pretty bad on a handle that was over a flame, and then marinated the burned area of my thumb in a cup of egg white. Not only did it not hurt at all, the next day it was as if nothing happened. Both remedies are almost instant, so you can get back to what you were doing with little delay.

Edit: of course you should use common sense with first degree burns and run them under cold water first! any burn beyond that should be treated by a medical proffesional.

Mutesiren	126	37	81	"Im a college student living off campus in a pretty old 2-story house and have 4 roommates that like to party and often sing or talk loudly throughout the day. My classes are usually early so that I can go home and fall back asleep without worrying about the rest of the day but all of the singing and random bursts of noise from all around the house usually wakes me up and makes me a bit grumpy.

I recently tried using earplugs - foam and silicone - but I've heard there could be long term issues from relying on them too often.. plus they don't work all that great.

I know there are some products you can buy to noise-proof doors (and it really seems like all of the sounds leak from around there) but they're pricey and some require a setup that involves drilling into the door. I'm living here for less than a year now so I don't feel comfortable doing that.

This then gives me four more food choices of anything I want. Sometimes usually adding capsican back, depending on the day. But as a worker on quite a low wage at the time, I use to order all the good stuff, like grilled chicken and bacon and all the expensive things that usually were quite expensive to add to any other pizza.

The brush didn't do jack. I bought some cleaner supplies but none of them worked either. I really don't want to get down there and scrape that old crap with a knife. Can anyone think of a way to loosen up that stuff so it will come off easily?

Edit- Wow! Thanks for all the suggestions. Here's what I've tried now:
1. The works. Had this at home. Tried it last Friday and it didn't work at all. 
2. Kaboom. Picked this up and sprayed it on. Leaving it overnight. I'll go back tomorrow to see if it helped at all. 


UPDATE- So the toilet is still nasty but mostly due to OP's incompetence. I plugged up the toilet and poured in coke but then had a really long weekend and wasn't back for a few days. The coke had all drained out (not sure how long it actually was in the bowl) and the crap was still cemented on. Turns out my plug for the toilet is pretty non-functional and I can't figure out another way to plug it. the drainage hole at the bottom is long and oval rather than round. Still working on it. I have high hopes for the coke but need to figure out how to plug the toilet first. "	t5_2qj5n	True

You'll need two things -- a torrent client and the .torrent file or magnet link from a trusted source that will provide the client with the needed information to hook up with other users and begin downloading.

If you're looking for a client, [µTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) is a very popular and lightweight client for all platforms. I myself prefer [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) (linux/mac only). Don't be a jerk, seed to at bare minimum 1:1 ratio, and 1:2 down/up normally.

**Open directories**

Open directories are simply unprotected folders that have been left open to the public (be it intentionally or accidentally). Huge pots of files can be found all across the web full of pictures, music, videos, porn, whatever. Once you find an open directory, you can either click on the wanted files one by one to download or grab them all at once using wget (available on all platforms, tutorial [here](http://www.regravity.com/documents/Wget%20%96%20A%20Noob%92s%20guide%20-%20Regravity.com.pdf)). /r/opendirectories is an awesome reddit to subscribe to, and the community will be a good place to ask detailed questions or get help with wget.

To search for files in open directories, you will use a custom Google search. Knowing how to use [search operators](http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html) is helpful but not necessary.

You want pages containing ""index of"" in the title. You do not want HTML pages, so you eliminate pages containing ""html"", ""htm"", or ""php"". Put the type of files you want to end up with in quotes (for example, ""mp3"" or ""epub""). You end up with a search looking like [this](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=queen+news+of+the+world+%22.mp3%22+-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+-inurl%3Aphp+intitle%3A%22Index+of%22+-site%3Awallywashis.name).

If you want to use wget, here is my usual command: 

    wget -e robots=off -r --no-parent -c --limit-rate=150k [url here, no brackets]

remove --limit-rate=150k or change the number if you like, I use that so wget doesn't hog all of my bandwidth and so I can continue browsing whilst using it.

**File-hosting sites**

[Filestube](http://www.filestube.com/) searches [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/), [Rapidshare](https://rapidshare.com/), [Filefactory](http://filefactory.com/), and other sites (see the [advanced search](http://www.filestube.com/advanced_search.html) option for a full list). I've found filestube to be far superior to its rivals, which tend to only search a few of the big sites.

Wildqbn	109	26	25	"I use Off (the bug spray) to remove the markings from permanent makers on our used equipment at work. WD40 works too but it leaves an oily residue. Off also removes the sticker residue. I use it everyday and I buy it in bulk at the local warehouse store. If you have a used school book or a CD or DVD case that you want to snazzy up to look new again. Spray it down with Off and the retail sticker residue and all marker and pen drawings will disappear.

PS: My neighbor had an ex spray-paint his car with accusations of infidelity (he was in fact banging other broads) and I went out that morning and with one can of OFF I removed all the spray paint from his car. This stuff is awesome!

Edit: Ouch! You guys nailed me good. I totally understand that this may not be the most practical way of handling permanent marker and the sticky gooey gunk left behind by stickers. But you gotta believe me, I've tried it ALL. Alcohol didn't work nor did many of the products that were designed to remove the stuff. One commenter stated that this was the fastest way to ruin plastic. I have never had it ruin anything and if you buy the unscented Off you don't even have to deal with the unpleasant scent.

1340000782.0	v7psu	Colemak, the alternative Typing layout	LiquidTurbo	115	37	59	"A year ago I learned how to Type the Colemak keyboard layout and I consider it one of the best lifehacks I've learned to do. It took about a week to learn but it's paid itself many times over considering how much typing one does in a life time.

QWERTY was all about fitting the human being around the machine (typewriters were jamming up too much), so QWERTY was design to slow down the human typer as much as possible.

With Colemak, the keys are optimized to fit the human hand. Far more typing is done on the homerow. Afterall, why are the keys JKL; under the stronger fingers of your right hand? Wouldn't it make much more sense to have letters like HNEIO? 

Anyway it's changed my computing life for the better, feel free to AMA.

BTW, I can still type QWERTY no problem, it's like being bilingual, you can effortly switch between the two. But honestly with the benefitis of Colemak I never type QWERTY really.

Edit: Some advantages:

Ergonomic and comfortable – Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.

Easy to learn – Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same. Typing lessons available.

Fast – Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio."	t5_2qj5n	True

First, figure out which nostril is more stuffed up. Then lie down on the opposite side. For example if it's your right nostril lie down on your left side and visa versa. Next, just wait. Gravity will do its job and force the snot out of the top nostril into your navel cavity and then into the bottom nostril. Before it gets into the bottom nostril you will feel a sudden relief that you can breath. Blow your nose now. Blow it hard. You only have a short window to act so be ready. When you blow be ready for an eruption of deliciously goodness and relief. (Be sure to have plenty of tissues at the ready).  It's a really good way to clear your sinus'. Plus all you have to do is lie down. I can confirm this works. (I'm doing it right now). Basically all you do is repeat this whenever you get a stuffy nose.  Have fun and Gods speed. 	t5_2qj5n	True

Why this is brilliant: Because rice cookers turn off when the container becomes light enough through evaporation, you won't have to worry about your herbs burning to a crisp.

 I then bought in-ear headphones (the ones with silicon tips), and they still fell out because the of the weight of the cable tugging at them, especially since it is bouncing around as you run. 

Simple solution I came up with is to use a small length (10cm or so) of micropore tape (the kind they use in surgery to tape bits to you, cheap and available in supermarket/pharmacy) to tape the cables to my chest. 

This stops the cable tugging at the headphones=awesome uninterrupted drum-and-bass-fuelled running (or whatever your taste may be)"	t5_2qj5n	True

1339452151.0	uwuih	Don't Answer the telemarketers	unclenoah	120	51	74	"If you get a lot of telemarketer calls on your mobile phone, try this -- create a contact in your phone's address book named ""Don't Answer"" then, when you get calls from telemarketers, simply save the number to that contact.  If they ever call back from that number, you'll see ""Don't Answer"" pop up on your phone's screen, and you'll know you don't need to answer that call (this can be used with other numbers you really shouldn't be answering too).  Telemarkers are sneaky, and they don't always display their numbers, or sometimes they mask them (999-999-9999 or something like that) but in a short while you'll be surprised what a good list you'll build in this ""Don't Answer"" contact, and how few telemarketer calls you wind up actually answering.

Take this tip to the next level by checking with your buddies every couple of months and combine the numbers on your ""Don't Answer"" contacts.  Your lists will build faster, and you'll take fewers and fewer unwanted calls."	t5_2qj5n	True

*Short:*      
1st: Put all your stuff in 1 folder     
2nd: Create 1 .exe to open your hidden folder with a password     
3rd: Create 1 .bat/.exe to close your folder after you're done      

What it **does** with screenshots: [Click]( http://imgur.com/a/vzMCM)      

____________________________________________________     

Step1:     
 Create a bat file containing:
&gt;@echo off    
&gt;cd /d d:\NSFW\Downloads2    
&gt;set/p password=    
&gt;if %password% == custompassword goto next     
&gt;exit     
&gt;:next     
&gt;attrib -h +r +s /s /d     
&gt;explorer d:\NSFW\downloads2     

Step2:
 Create a second bat file containing and put it in your secret folder     
&gt;@echo off    
&gt;cd /d d:\NSFW\Downloads2    
&gt;attrib +h +r +s /s /d    
&gt;taskkill /f /im explorer.exe    
&gt;explorer.exe    
&gt;exit   

Step3!:
 Convert your .bat file to an .exe file so your password is safe.
 Do this by downloading a small compiler; (1st link in google or for the lazy: [Cnet.com](http://download.cnet.com/Bat-To-Exe-Converter/3000-2069_4-10555897.html) )
