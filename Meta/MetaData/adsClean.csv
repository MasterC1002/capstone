Thank you for subscribing and using this subreddit, we really appreciate your commitment to reddit ads! Right now, almost all the posts are because someone has clicked ""reddit this ad"" under a banner and discussed amongst yourselves what has stood out about an ad campaign (both good and bad). 

We want you to keep up the good work (we do read this stuff and take your opinions seriously). We also want you to have a place to discuss advertising at high-level â€” if you don't like an ad:

- what about it is upsetting?
- How could it be improved?
- If you like an ad, what else could the brand do that would make the reddit experience better for you?
- etc.

We know ads can be a touchy subject, and we want to be as open and honest with what we are allowing to be shown on the site. More importantly, we want you to have a say. Keep ""redditing this ad"" here, but also use this space to talk to us about ads, if there's one you like or hate, or if you see anything funky that should be on our radar. This goes for any and all ads on the site (banners, self-serve, targeted, no matter how big or small the subreddit, or front page).

We'll be keeping an eye out, and will as always do our best to keep an open communication with you."	t5_1efbr	True

If I read the rules correctly, the only acceptable forms of payment are credit cards connected to banks in the USA. Because I live in Europe, I'm left out in the rain.

Interestingly, I can buy Reddit Gold using PayPal. I've bought myself and lots of other people into the Lounge, and there was never a problem. Is Reddit really that worried about being stiffed?

I am a big advocate of helping charities get their message to the public for the cheapest price possible. I am wondering if there is any place on reddit for getting views for a PSA. perhaps the ability to post links to the PSA on the ad sections of reddit. Even paying reddit minimum (charity discount) to get adds for PSAs on reddit. I would really like to hear some feed back. 

I also believe that youtube should start using PSAs as part of their advertising, and would love to here any feed back you may have about that.

1292432134.0	emarv	i bought my first ad - so far, it's not going as well as I hoped	paulwheaton	11	6	5	"It's at the top of r/cooking.  About cast iron.

Maybe there is a more optimal way to do this - and I will learn more in time.  

The thing is that I'm not really a big business.  I'm just a guy.  I wrote an article and have some amazon links in it.  So, the income from the links will never be more than what I paid for the /r/cooking ads, and I'm okay with that.  

I guess I'm just feeling a bit ...  dirty.  I was kinda hoping I would feel ... really good.  Like I'm helping.  I knew that the ad would look the way it looks.  And now that I check my GA stuff for today ... the traffic seems low.  And so I get to thinking about why I think - well, redditors can be a sensitive bunch.  Maybe the see the thing at the top as a nasty corporate whore sort of thing.  Something to automatically ignore.  

I think it is proper to point out ""this got to the top cuz they paid to get here"" - I guess I just wish it weren't so easily dismissed.  

So as I am pondering my first ad and fantasizing about what could be, I have these ideas:

A)  What if sponsorship could be less highlighted.  Or maybe sponsors could opt for highlighting or opt out of highlighting.  It still says ""sponsored link"" - that's fine.  

B)  Different idea:  what if there could be some hover text.  Maybe the sponsor could choose to turn it on or off.  The hover text could be something like ""hot dog!  these guys supported reddit with sponsored link"" - maybe that will help folks be a bit more supportive of reddit sponsors. 

C)  yet another different idea:  Suppose I posted something in a forum and it did well, but a couple of months passed.  It would be neat to turn to that normal reddit link and say I'm willing to shell out $30 to push it to the sponsored link spot for a day.  Maybe it will gather a few more upvotes.   So, in time, if I shell out enough money, maybe it will make one of the top lists.  

There ya go - my first thoughts on my first ad.  

Thanks!

These sorts of ads. I mean the first one I thought was one of your game, but it's one of those stupid ads, and the second... well I'm certainly not stupid enough to click on it. These ads belong on websites where the users are actually gullible enough to click on them, not on reddit.
