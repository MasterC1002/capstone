""On the day that Brody comes home I wanted to say thank you to you all. This comes from the bottom of my heart, and with feeling that I never knew existed:

When you turn on the news you get the overwhelming feeling that the world is full of hate; what a load of shit.  There is so much love and the world is so beautiful, which is why we are elated that our son has the chance to experience it.

Many of you attribute Brody's life and success to God answering prayers, which is great and I do not want to take that away from anyone.  All I ask is that you do not take any credit away from or forget the men and women on the medical teams at Miami Valley Hospital and Cincinnati Children's.  Humanity has learned so much from all of our successes and failures and we have to thank the countless number of staff members and families that led to the knowledge base that kept Brody alive as he fought this.  The medical teams work tirelessly to save and improve babies lives and they deserve all the praise we can give them.

The hospital staff is composed of all religious and non-religious  backgrounds.  Therefore this is a victory for all of mankind, all deities, and all denominations.  ALL of these people went above and beyond the call of duty providing comfort and love to a situation in dire need of it.  I can't explain in words how awesome all of these people are, and it was truly a pleasure getting to know each and every one of them.  If there is such a thing as Angels, I can assure you that these people are as close as you can get.  We have a family because of their knowledge and execution, and we will be forever grateful to them for that.  Please incorporate them into your praises and keep them all in your thoughts, and if religious, your prayers.  Again, they deserve much more praise than our family alone could ever give them.  I don't know what the medical staff in NICUs make for compensation but I can tell you it isn't enough.  These people save babies lives.  You cannot put a price on that.

The fact that hundreds of people were thinking of Brody and our family helped us so much and got us through this, and we are very grateful.  I never truly knew pain nor love before this happened, and there is so much love, you all showed us that.  We hope you all stay in touch and contribute to the man he will become, and the woman our daughter will become. Thank you all again for your support, it is truly awesome having such a great support system.  

Specific thanks to DataYard  and Tri-County North staff for providing emotional support and monetary donations, our good friends for all they have done, and the absolutely wonderful organization Ronald McDonald House for not only housing us, but hundreds of thousands of families worldwide so they can be close to family members receiving care.  Also, thanks to all of you who donated to the cause. 

Huge thanks to our families for too many things to post on here. 

Lastly, I would like to thank the strongest person I have ever met, my wife Amber.  I wouldn't have made it through this sane without her.  I love you Amber.

Much love."""	t5_2tb3h	True

I have two children with my ex-wife - a nearly-5 daughter and a coming-up-on-3 son. The ex and I separated and then divorced not long after my son was born. I met someone special, and remarried. The ex was not nice in the divorce. I had been the working part-time, mostly stay at home dad while she made $150k+ per year at her job. From the moment I left, she started squeezing me financially (I was still taking care of the kids during the day) and she filed for divorce first. She made it a contested divorce despite all my pleas to do things peacefully, mostly because she had all of our money and knew I couldn't afford to truly fight it out. Given the income disparity, I could have legally forced her to pay some of my legal fees, but going that route would have left us both financially wrecked.

So, I racked up a ton of credit card debt paying for a lawyer, and then  more debt putting some of my living expenses on credit cards as I was working part time and still the primary care-taker for the kids. Long story short, I ended up in a huge financial hole I am only just beginning to be able to *start* to crawl my way out of.

So I ended up in this place where I was/am stressed because of finances, I'm tired because I am always either working or taking care of the kids, and I realize that for all the sacrifices I've made for my kids the cost has been me just not being there mentally when I'm with them physically. I mean sure I have good days, but too often I retreat into my man-cave (office) and distract myself while leaving them to extended periods of 'self directed play'. I go out there when there's a problem, and make sure nobody hurts themselves but I'm not really *there*. It sucks. I know I need to do a better job, but I struggle a lot with it. Some days my temper with them is really short and I end up yelling which isn't remotely productive and makes everyone unhappy (including me). And this is all exacerbated by my daughter's seeming inability to listen.

She can hear - trust me I had that checked out. She just either zones out a lot of what I say, or chooses to ignore it. Simple tasks take multiple requests. I might ask her to put her socks and shoes on so we aren't late for school while I get her brother dressed. She says 'okay' and I come back a few minutes later and she's sitting there reading a book. This kind of thing happens all the time. She'll grab her brother in play, I tell her to let him go and she'll hold on and hold on and it takes me 3, 4, 5 requests of increasing volume and 'intensity' to get her to actually let him go. Meanwhile if someone else asks her to do a simple task it gets done almost immediately.

But she bounces between this state and an overly needy one. Wants me to carry her around the house, help her pull her pants down for potty time, feed her her food as though she isn't capable of doing it herself. I'm trying to foster a sense of independence for her but refusal results in some pretty epic tantrums at the drop of a hat. I've tried talking with her about it, but it doesn't seem to change anything.

What kills me is I want to be doing more stuff with her. I love taking them out to the park, and walking through the woods. I want to teach her to play tennis (or any other sport if she has a preference). But these long stretches where she won't listen, or throws tantrums over small things makes it really difficult. Combine that kind of behavior with my fatigue/stress level and it's a bad mixture.

Here's how I am currently dealing with these kinds of episodes:
- Ignoring requests etc results in either time out or her being sent to her room
- Inappropriate tantrums are often resolved if I threaten to put her in timeout or her room, but not always. I typically give her some alone time in her room if she gets too worked up so she can calm down and realize I won't engage that behavior

Anyways, I don't know if this actually makes sense or is cohesive, but I'd really love some advice. I want to be a better father. I don't have these same problems with my son. Sure he misbehaves sometimes, but he is overall far better behaved than she is. Parents of Reddit I beseech you: help! :)"	t5_2tb3h	True

about what is admissible in the house.  This has become a source of friction.  
So today, I was taking out all the garbage upstairs, and indirectly, found a used condom
in his bathroom garbage can.  FREAKING OUT!!  I don't know if we should confront him about this, or
just play dumb.  I am not a prude, and was a teenage boy myself at one point, and at that age, if a cute girl 
was willing to have sex w/me, I would not have passed on the offer.  I am glad that they are using a condom, but
I have a real problem with them ""doing it"" in my house, when I have no clue as to what this girl's parents know about
them. I now have visions of her father coming over here one night, and beating the shit out of me.  
She also bought him a really expensive birthday present recently ($200 telescope).  I know if we confront him,
We will just end up alienating ourselves before he goes to college, and they will probably find somewhere else
to do it anyways.  On the flip-side, I am worried that he is going away now, and this girl will be spending
her Senior year ""waiting"" for him, and he will feel stressed-out in college with them being apart.  They both are still 
young, and have a whole life ahead.  I can't see this ending well.  HELP!

1375398729.0	1jj155	How do you feel about giving rides to kids who do not fit your seat safely? (need a booster or car seat)	sprgtime	26	3	37	"Somewhat related to the other post about car seats... how do you handle it when you're giving a ride to someone with their kid, or their kid alone... and the child needs a car seat but one is not provided?


I was told by a mother of twin infants to not bother buckling the bucket seats for her babies, because they were basically wedged in the back seat of my small car, with my son in the middle seat and her babies on each side seat.  Since she had the car seats, I insisted that we install them because I wouldn't feel comfortable driving, knowing that her babies seats weren't even buckled.  She humored me but I could tell she was annoyed... and then she talked the whole way there about how she thought car seats were a scam and unnecessary.  

I've been asked to give a 1-yr-old a ride before and ""don't bother with a car seat, because you're only going a few blocks"".  I refused.  And since there wasn't a car seat to use, they ended up calling another friend and I watched the little kid just get buckled right into the back seat with a regular seat belt.

More recently, and this has been coming up a lot and is harder for me to deal with... giving rides to kids who should at least be a booster seat (but are small enough to still fit in my son's 5-point-harness) and they're used to riding with only a seat belt.  I put them in my car, and see that they don't FIT the seat belt.  I don't care if they're 8 or 9 years old... they don't fit my vehicle's seatbelt.  

If I know this is a possibility that I'll be giving a ride to someone's kid, I've been taking a booster with me, just in case.  But often this happens because it's not the plan.  If my son isn't with me, I've had other kids sit in his seat before, obviously, if it's empty.  But usually he's with me.  He's big for his age.  I've had an 8-yr-old in my car a couple weeks ago, who was smaller than him physically, but riding in just a seat belt (around his waist, since he was too short to be without a booster).  I was actually debating which kid to put in the car seat and decided that my kid's bones were less developed with him being younger, and it's the other kid's parents who clearly let him go without a booster even in their own cars... but I'd feel awful if I was in an accident and somebody's kid was hurt in my car with me driving.  I've never been in an accident and have been driving for 17 years, but I still wear my seatbelt every time I get in the car."	t5_2tb3h	True

It is not intended to be limited to either mothers or to those practicing attachment parenting. I am especially interested in making sure that fathers feel welcome, since I know from the experience of my own husband that being non-primary caregiver to a high need baby poses its own emotional challenges.

I have also accumulated many resources on the topic which I have posted, and will eventually turn into a wiki.

I am personally hoping to hear also from parents of grown-up high need babies, to better help me predict my own future.

1362158448.0	19gzqp	[meta] 3000 Subscribers!	ozyman	28	6	2	"If you've been around /r/raisingKids for more than a few months this post may look familiar to you.  Every 1000 subscribers I like to post something to talk about the community in general, and where we are going, and give everyone a chance to weigh in with respect to what they like, don't like and want out of /r/raisingkids.


We reached 1000 subscribers in 4 months, and 2000 at 8  months, and 3000 after about a year, so growth has been very steady.  I figured some of you may be interested in our traffic stats, so here is what today looked like: [http://imgur.com/a/ZOGKI](http://imgur.com/a/ZOGKI)

Observant readers may also notice that we are closer to 4000 subscribers than 3000 subscribers at this point.  This mostly is because I wasn't sure what to say in this post.   In the past ([1000](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/tfwvx/meta1000_subscribers/), [2000](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/comments/10a5jt/meta2000_subscribers/)) I have talked primarily about what differentiates /r/raisingKids from the other parenting communities (primarily /r/parenting), which was always two things:

#1) A greater respect for rediquette
#2) A restriction on Low Investment Material

But, right around the time we broke 3000 subscribers, /r/parenting instituted a rule change - only allowing image posts on Wednesdays.  And suddenly half the reason for having /r/raisingKids seemed to disappear.  For a week or so I thought about just closing up /r/raisingKids, but then I noticed something.  There had been no mass exodus from /r/raisingKids.  In fact subscriber numbers were growing faster than ever (almost 500 new subscribers in the month after the /r/parenting change).  So I figured if all these people still found something worthwhile in /r/raisingKids, I should keep it going.

But I do think it is good to ask what the purpose of /r/raisingKids is.  More specifically how are we different from /r/parenting?  Beside a slightly stronger rejection of Low Investment Material, I hope that another difference is a stronger focus on rediquette.   This is primarily 1) be polite and 2) encourage interesting discussions.

Polite/rude behavior is in the eye of the beholder, but please downvote rude behavior and report repeat offenders or any posts you find excessively mean and hateful.

Encouraging good discussions is up to everyone to not upvote/downvote solely due to agreement/disagreement. **If a post is well sourced, makes interesting points, and/or presents a minority opinion consider upvoting even if you do not personally agree**. It is better to upvote and then reply with criticisms, then to downvote and move on.

How else are we different?  Well, I guess we are a smaller community.   Also, I think that in general we are a more progressive community.  If I had to guess I would say that our readers are more likely to co-sleep, breastfeed longer, follow more attachment parenting principles, and be more interested and open to more 'modern' parenting philosophies like positive parenting, playful parenting, gentle discipline, unconditional parenting etc.

Having said that **I sincerely hope that everyone can feel welcome here. It is easy to feel like every parenting decision you make is being criticized by someone, so I think it is especially important to be helpful and respectful, with as little judgement as possible.**

This is starting to get long, so let me wrap up by briefly listing some of the (hopefully) upcoming changes to /r/raisingKids (and please give me input!):

* **Flair**   We have a well defined template for user flair, but interest has been abysmal, so it is obviously time to do something different. 
* **Wiki**  Reddit recently upgraded the wiki system and it is now pretty good, so I'd like to think about what we should put on the wiki &amp; who to give access to.
* **Sidebar** I want to move some of the less active parenting communities off the sidebar &amp; onto the wiki &amp; I know there are some new parenting communities to add.
* **CSS** Would be nice to update the CSS and give /r/raisingKids a bit of a facelift (maybe  /r/mindashq or /r/edurne) 

**TL;DR** - We've reached 3000 subscribers and are well on our way to 4000! Be excellent to each other."	t5_2tb3h	True

The problem: Daughter gets very mad and frustrated about anything she doesn't like or agree with. This morning, for instance, she wanted a bowl of strawberries for breakfast. We knew that would only hurt her stomach that early in the morning and offered her either a pancake or a bowl of cereal. She starts screaming that she wants strawberries and says she hates the other two options. We told her no. So she calls me and my wife nasty names, poopy head, diarrhea peepee ect. We still won't give in so she runs up and hits me in the nuts (not intentionally in the nuts but intentionally hit me). I told her to go to her room, to which she continued to call me names. I go to pick her up and she starts hitting and kicking me even more. When I finally get her to her room and put her on her bed, she springs off of it and wrestles me to get back out of her room. If I am successful in getting her to stay in her room, she kicks the walls, pushs/pulls on the door knob to make loud noises, throws everything off of her bed and empties all toys on the floor. All while screaming that she hates me and my wife.
We've tried time outs, spanking, taking things she cares about and nothing seems to work. It's like she's in this destructive trance and can't get out of it. When she finally calms down (could be 15 minutes, could be the next day) she is sobbing and completely worn out.

Even on Amazon most of the reviews seem to be parents complaining about their inability to install the software and make it work, or complaining about the need to insert CDs, etc. This won't be a problem for me and since it's a dedicated laptop I'll just be ripping ISOs and mounting them all.

For a while we put his bad behaviour at home down to jealousy with a baby around. But they both attend daycare, and apparently behave like angels there. 

I'm afraid my wife and I were a lot like our eldest when we were his age (my wife says she was much worse actually!). He regularly gets into small fits of rage when he doesn't get what he wants, and not a day goes by without at least one or two time-outs in his bedroom.

My wife works four days a week, I work five. Truth be told I'm afraid I often have work to do in the evenings, and so don't really have the energy to be fully present (answering ""why"" questions x100 is tiring after a long day!!).

I just found out I am pregnant with (planned) baby #2 so reality has set in and we are trying to figure out what the best lifestyle will be for our family moving forward. I have been looking for work for work but we can theoretically afford for me to stay home. Regardless, I probably need to do side projects to stay professionally appealing. I do all the cleaning, shopping, yard work other than mowing, etc. and cook most of our meals from scratch using whole foods. We also spend a few days a week with friends, museums, parks, play dates, etc.

I was in my mid-thirties when I had my son and had spent years before then working as an executive on the account side of the marketing world. I got to see how lots of other folks on the client and account side managed the work-life balance. I have also watched friends and family. I grew up with a single mom who had to work long hours putting herself through school when I was a young child and hated it.

From what I have seen, raising young infants/children with two parents in demanding jobs is incredibly stressful. Even if you have a housekeeper once a week, you still have to do all the shopping, cooking, laundry, and daily tidying. Plus you have to conform to the daycare schedule, pack/unpack for daycare and deal with frequent sick days. In my line of work you are expected to respond to email constantly and work intense hours on projects. My husband works on startups which are incredibly demanding. I see it being a nightmare. When would I have time to spend with my babies? My son was a high needs baby who I feel has thrived with me being with him 24/7. I can't imagine having another baby and not being home with him/her considering we can afford it and I want to do it.

My husband grew up in a joint family in India where he was raised my grandparents, aunts and uncles in addition to his parents. His sisters in the US both work full-time and his few friends with kids do too. As an immigrant I think he is more drawn to the mainstream American lifestyle and hasn't seen the harsh reality of what that life is really like. When I mention things like how his niece cried every day for years when being dropped off at daycare he shrugs and thinks that is part of what the American experience is and points to how academically and socially successful she is in high school. 

My husband feels that we'll both be more ""productive"" if we worked full time outside the home. For instance, I have a hard time making calls to contractors/insurance agents during the day and struggle to find time to work on professional development projects in addition to job search stuff. Eventually we'll both need to be prepared to earn good incomes as we live in the pricey Bay Area and want a good education for our children and retirement savings. We'll either have to move from our nice but affordable neighborhood or do private schools towards the end of elementary school because we value education a lot and the schools / older peer groups leave a lot to be desired. He also thinks I spend too much time cooking and socializing, both things I do at times when the baby is awake and I couldn't do anything ""productive"" anyways.

My solution is to try to have more of a schedule. We already have a loose routine but it's really easy to get behind and put my son to bed later than we could, cutting into time to work on my projects, for instance. If we are 30 - 60 minutes behind the earliest possible bedtime the boy is very fussy and exhausting to deal with. We aren't schedule people but I figure it is worth a try.

While I know some parents love working I know many more would love to be home if they could. What have you experienced?

1360533722.0	189o8b	Questions about very picky eaters.	brisingfreyja	22	1	28	"My son just turned 7. He refuses to eat most foods. If it isn't battered and deep fried, or made out of sugar, chances are he wont eat it. He has been spoiled by family, and his great eating habits went out the window. When he was younger, he loved everything. Unless it had a really strong taste, like sauerkraut, lemons and pickles. Now he will only eat things that are deep fried, or battered. Things must not touch, or be cooked together. So soup and many other foods he will refuse. 

He's stopped eating almost altogether. His usual favorites, he won't go near them. We just ate pizza for dinner last night. His favorite, but he wouldn't even look at it. Anyone else experiencing this?

I know most kids get picky around this age, but this seems like way more than should be normal. I'm worried because he recently developed the touching rule, and also recently stopped eating his favorite foods. He's so picky, he wont eat certain brands. All chicken must be tyson chicken, and all potatoes must be either mcdonalds or crowns which are little tater tots. 

I've talked to his doctor, and the doc says its normal. He's healthy, but I'm going nuts. I just made cheese and crackers, another favorite, but he wont eat it because the cheese is the wrong brand. His grandmother started this trend.

[edit] We've tried the ""if you don't eat, you don't get to play video games"" and eat until you're full, and a whole long list. Nothing seems to work, they only make it worse.

We've just started this food bingo thing. We all got to pick a bunch of things we wanted on the card, and we all have to try them. Things he hates, things he loves, went on the card. When he fills the card (eats all the food from it) then we will all decide something he can get in exchange for trying new things. He seems super excited about it, he loves charts and things. I'm thinking we can get him to try quite a few things before the newness of it wears off. "	t5_2tb3h	True

Dada. Dada... Daddy?  Daddy..."" and so forth.  At first I'd jump up and go in there, pat him on the back, but most nights after going in there time and time again I'd just put him in our bed or lay next to his bed while he slept.  It's like he wouldn't sleep unless i was there.

After a few nights of this my wife would go in there, but he'd just say ""I want daddy, not you"".  I'm honored and all, but this has gone on for way too long.

So last night I figured I'd try the ol' ferber and at his usual 11:30pm when he started calling for me I went in, patted him on the back, and left.  He just kept calling my name, but I gave him about 10 minutes and went back in.   Still calling my name after midnight so I gave him 15 minutes and so forth.  By 1:30am and going in there every 10-15 minutes or more he was crying crazily so I ended up just sleeping with him on the couch since it was obvious neither of us were getting any sleep.  Also we have a 5 year old who this also woke-up, so double whammy.

So any suggestions?  Our son actually has eye surgery on Thursday to hopefully correct his strabismus so I know we'll have some rough nights after that, so maybe it's not worth working on this until next week.  But I'm at my whits end on what to do next.

Tonight, for example, we went to my Aunt and Uncle's Vow Renewal and 25th Wedding Anniversary Party. I tried getting her to take a nap today, she flat out refused for 3 hours, which at that point, it was time to go. We get to the party, and she immediately starts running around, not listening. I got her fed, and surprisingly she sat long enough to do that.

I ended up having to take her in the bathroom twice for talks. When we went outside to get some fresh air, she wouldn't stay out of an opened gate. Later on, she sat down to eat some cake, I ended up having to go on a coloring book run, so I could keep Charmony (almost 2) seated for a while. That held Sydneys interest for about 5 minutes, MAYBE 10, but that's a stretch. She was doing fine with karaoke later. We were saying our goodbyes, and she ran off..again. My mom ended up getting her, and the whole time she was carrying her to the door, she was screaming ""Let me go!!"" repeatedly.

They took balloons home from the party, they were tied to the diaper bag. Sydney wouldn't stop kicking them to the front seat, so I let them go....World War 3 started. I pulled into a parking lot and told her to get out of my car, that she was walking the rest of the way home (with my mom, I was going to drive about half a block away to the gas station, they were just going to meet me there, so she wasn't walking all the way home). The restaurant was still open, so I ended up getting out of the car with her, because she refused to get out, I made her sit on the curb while I talked to her.

I wouldn't let her get back in the car until she stopped crying and screaming. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice is welcome!!"	t5_2tb3h	True

No_Speed_Limit	20	2	19	"My boys turned five in December. Over the past six months, they've gone from arguing once every few hours to arguing once every ten minutes.

They also started getting more physical and have been hurting each other (not seriously, but making each other cry). Having twin birthdays and Christmases made December a month of constant presents so that may have contributed to the growing sense of ownership, but the bickering started around age four and a half and hasn't let up.

1357864692.0	16cjv3	Positive parenting tips needed for early walker in public - how to let him explore and not be constrained while teaching him to hold hands and stay nearby?		28	10	41	"My son started walking at 10.5 months and I have used a lot of your advice to help manage him at home. We need help for when we are out and about.

At home I have been consistently using redirection and communication and after a month of patient practice he now will play in ""his"" cabinet and with his toys rather than constantly trying to take spices out or get into the garbage. Of course, he still tries to push limits, but it isn't constant. 

I would love to hear your tips about how to let him walk and be down in public without wandering away and with holding my hand when necessary. He will hold hands when he needs help, like navigating stairs, but if you try to hold his hands at other times he turns to non-violent resistance and sits down. If I try putting him down at a restaurant say, he insists on wandering. All he wants these days is to be down exploring. Luckily he doesn't show signs of bolting.

I know that a lot of this boils down to time and development, but I'd love to start working on this. I am a believer in socializing kids to know how to behave in public (at appropriate venues) but need to be safe. I want to help him be independent and walk but need to be able to hold his hand.

Thanks for your help!!

EDIT It is working!! I have been practicing walking with my son and he is much better about holding hands. I was really surprised about how quickly he gets over sitting when he realizes I am still going to hold his hand. When we are holding hands, I indulge his interest in things we pass if it is safe and not too much of a nuisance to others (yes: window display of stuffed animals, no: escalator) and I have time. When he resists too much, usually because he is very interested in something or tired, I just pick him up. He'll sometimes throw a fit but I explain my rationale for what is happening in simple terms and he usually settles quickly. The process is very sensible, I just lacked confidence in following through. Thank you, Reddit. I get a kick out of walking through the mall holding hands with my baby who isn't even a year old yet. He just loves it too."	t5_2tb3h	True

&gt;Free to Be… You and Me, a project of the Ms. Foundation for Women, is a record album and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as ""Marlo Thomas and Friends"") including Alan Alda, Rosey Grier, Cicely Tyson, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, and Diana Ross. An ABC Afterschool Special using poetry, songs, and sketches, followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality, saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one's identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

1342705303.0	wte7s	Parents of Reddit, I need your advice!	CplPwnies	20	4	28	"Parents of Reddit,

I need some advice. I currently am the step-father to a wonderful 6 year old little boy. I started dating his mother, who is now my wife of almost a year, when he was 18 months old. I've always strived to be the best father figure for him, and my wife and I are always spending a lot of time with him. We read a lot, play games (whether it be board games, learning games on our tablet / PC), ride bikes, and me and him go to Tae Kwon Do together as our special bonding time. He seems to really enjoy it.

But, for as long as I can remember, he seems to have a little trouble entertaining himself when I'm trying to do some work (I work in Healthcare IT, so I'm always working at random times), or when my wife is trying to do her online school classes. I understand him being 6 years old and having that curious mind, but he just cannot play by himself for even the shortest amount of time. He doesn't play with any of his toys, he doesn't read any of his books, he doesn't do anything in his room, nor does he seem interested in being in there. He just wants to hover over us and watch us or be around us. And, when he gets too underfoot, we send him to his room to play with his things, he'll just sit there in his room and do nothing. Or, he'll find excuses to call Mommy in there for whatever reason. He'll even start crying really loud if Mommy does not come right away.

We even recently re-did his room. Re-painted, added strips to the wall, bought him an awesome new bunk bed, with a desk under it so he can color, draw, paint, play with legos, etc. But, that did not seem to help.

This behavior has gotten worse over the past few months, but it just seems he cannot entertain himself at all. Even for an hour while Mommy and I do some work.

So, this is either not normal behavior, or I'm just over analyzing the situation.

I don't want him to sit around watching TV all the time either. But, it also seems that if it doesn't involve a sort of electronics, then there's nothing to do. Right now, during the summer, he has one hour of electronics time a day.

So, parents of reddit, what can I do?

1. 
My wife and I are starting to get close to 30. 
1. 
We've watched from afar as many of our acquaintances from undergrad have started their families. 
1. 
We're finically stable and relatively successful.
1. My wife is much more ready than I am. Honestly, the thought being responsible for another life from birth to they reach adulthood terrifies me. 
1. 
We both work in the human services field with in-risk youth. On a daily basis we see what happens when familial relationships break down. This leads me to be terrified that I could irrevocably mess up my own kid even though we are both paid to ""fix"" kids. 
1. 
We are meticulous planners. We've had several discussions about when would be a good time. We've starting to amass the things that we ""think"" that we would need. 

So, how did you know that you were ready? Did anyone else experience similar fears? If so, did they ever go away? Are there things or questions that you wish that you would have known/asked before you started trying? 

Thanks in advance.

Some of his friends play FPS games like Call of Duty Black Ops.  I don't feel comfortable with it for a couple of reasons:  1) research has shown a correlation between those games and increased aggression.  I think one of the last things our society needs is more aggression and 2) if a kid plays CoD at this age, where does he go from there?  What does he ""move up to"" when he's a teen?  Despite how this might sound, I am not a helicopter parent.  But I am in favor of media literacy, both for kids and parents.  I don't think video games are bad per se, and I know the ratings systems can be flawed.  But I question whether an M-rated game is ever appropriate for a kid under 13 (and yes, I know the gore and language on some of those games can be turned off/toned down, but it's still a concern).  I can't protect them from everything (nor do I desire to), they hear bad language on the playground, etc.  But I think a media diet is comparable to a food diet ... I can't control what he eats at a friend's house, but I can moderate what he eats at home which is the majority of his diet.  So it is with media exposure.

Redditors tend to be younger and more video game savvy than I am, so I thought I'd pose this question here.  Am I being overprotective by saying no to the FPS games, at least until he's in middle school?"	t5_2tb3h	True

I live with my grandparents, and they help me out with my niece as well. My problem is, that no matter what, my niece refuses to clean herself after going number 2 in the bathroom. She has no problem any other time, but just wont if she poops. She'll sit there and call one of my grandparents to clean up for her, and yet they'll do it. Every single time. I've told her, as well as her mom, that she's old enough to clean herself, but she still won't do it.
My grandparents spoil her, so that might be part of the cause.
I was just wondering, is this a normal thing for a six year old? And how do I deal with it? Do I take away some of her more 'adult' privileges (playing on the ipod/computer) if she's just going to keep acting like a baby? Am I wrong for doing that? I'm not sure if this is a problem for her at home, but she sure does it a lot here.
I and her mother have talked to my grandparents about this problem, but they'll still hand her anything she wants, even if I tell them why she can't have it (for misbehaving, begging, stuff like that).

We reached 1000 subscribers in 4 months, and now 2000 in another 4 months, so growth has been very steady.  At this rate we should be around 3000 when /r/raisingKids is a year old.  I figured some of you may be interested in our traffic stats, so here is what today looked like: http://imgur.com/a/OVb5O

Milestones are a good occasion for looking back and looking forward and also a good occasion to remind newcomers and the rest of us of the type of community we are striving for.  

In my mind the #1 rule of our community is to follow rediquette.  This is primarily 1) be polite and 2) encourage interesting discussions.

Polite/rude behavior is in the eye of the beholder, but please downvote rude behavior and report repeat offenders or any posts you find excessively mean and hateful.

Encouraging good discussions is not something a mod can enforce.  It is up to everyone to not upvote/downvote solely due to agreement/disagreement.  If a post is well sourced, makes interesting points, and/or presents a minority opinion consider upvoting even if you do not personally agree.  It is better to upvote and then reply with criticisms, then to downvote and move on.

The second distinguishing characteristic of /r/raisingKids is the rejection of Low Investment Material.  If you have been around Reddit long enough you can see how not explicitly banning this material leads to it crowding out material of more depth.  Communities as diverse as  /r/scrubs, /r/weightroom, and /r/games have instituted similar rules, which shows how pervasive this issue is.

This post is also everyone's chance to talk about what we want out of this community and what we can do to improve it, so please let me know what you think we are doing right, what we could do better, and what improvements you would like to see in /r/raisingKids.

I don't really need anyone to take care of traditional mod duties like watching the spam trap, deleting obnoxious and off-topic posts, and banning idiots.  Thankfully those tasks have not yet taken up a substantial amount of time.

Instead I am offering up modship as a kind of reward for greater participation in this community.  I like finding good articles and posting them, but sometimes real life gets in the way or I feel burned out, so I am hoping to find a few other people willing to spend an hour or so each week to help find good content to post.  What I am looking for is anyone who can commit to posting at least 2 articles a week most weeks.

Additionally, it would be great if we got some mods to better represent a wider age range of children.  Right now Sprgtime and I both have kids that are 3-4 years old.  I was reading an article recently about infants and trying to decide if I should post it to /r/raisingKids.  It seemed like pretty obvious information, that I was well aware of, but then I realized that since my daughter is about 3.5 years old now, I no longer have the perspective of a new parent, and I no longer have a good feel for what is useful for parents of young children.  In a similar vein, I have very little idea what a parent of an older child might find useful.  Also I am less likely to come across articles that are relevant to parents with kids outside of a small range around my daughter's age.

Just post here or PM me if you are interested.

**EDIT**: Even if you don't have the time/inclination to find content to post, you can still help /r/raisingKids grow by checking [the new queue](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/new) regularly and upvoting liberally any comments and posts that you find helpful.

A1) One way to find good articles is to setup a news alert.  I know how to do this with google, but I bet other search engines can do it too.  I think you might need an account with google to use their alert system.

 This is pretty simple.  Just go to the [signup page](http://www.google.com/alerts).  You have to choose a search string.  This could be anything about parenting that you are interested in.  ""children education"", ""parenting technology"", ""kids social media"", ""kids movies"", ""children discipline"", ""toddler behavior"" etc.   Fill out the rest of the form, including your email address and submit.  Now you will get an email once a day or week depending on what you filled in.  When you get the email, scan through for interesting stories,  If you find a good one, skip down to step B below.


A2) Second way to find good articles is to check a site that you know regularly posts good content.  I have been collecting good sites that I find so far, and have a decent sized list:

* http://www.csmonitor.com/tags/topic/Parenting
* http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood
* http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family.html
* http://www.wired.com/geekdad/
* http://www.eurekalert.org/bysubject/index.php?kw=231
* http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/
* http://www.nhs.uk/news/pages/newsarticles.aspx?TopicId=Pregnancy%2fchild
* http://rebeccahains.wordpress.com/
* http://www.parentingscience.com/
* http://mommadata.blogspot.com/
* http://www.investigatinghealthyminds.org/cihmResourcesPub.html
* http://www.scienceofrelationships.com/home/tag/parenting
* http://www.phdinparenting.com/
* http://www.childmind.org/en/hot-topics/parenting
* http://www.janetlansbury.com/
* http://healthland.time.com/tag/kids/
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Parenting
* http://www.huffingtonpost.com/parents/
* http://hubski.com/tag?id=parenting

If /r/raisingKids hasn't had much content some day, I start working my way through this list until I find something good.  Once you find a good article at one of these sites, go to step B.   If you have suggestions for other good sites, please post them in the discussion.



B) Once you find an article, read it over.  If the topic sounds interesting, but the article itself isn't that great, you can use google (bing, etc.) to find other articles about the same topic.  I will sometimes pull up 2 or 3 articles on the same topic and then pick the best one to submit.  If you found more than one good article with non-overlapping content, consider a self post so you can include both, or make a comment with a link to the other article.


C) Before you submit, there are a couple things you can do to improve the quality of your submission.

* If you use the 'suggest a title' feature, check if the suggested title is sensationalized.  Lots of times I see a good article, but the title goes beyond what the article claims, or is just a bad summary, so I don't use it and try to write my own better title.

* Remove any indications of the originating website.  Many websites will append their name or URL to the end of the suggested title, but you don't need this because reddit shows you the domain after the title, so it is cleaner to remove it.

* Try to get it on a single page. Some websites, like Slate offer a 'single page' version of the link.  Sometimes you can get the version formatted for printing to get a cleaner format.

D) Once you submit, consider making a comment to stimulate discussion.  If you thought there was something wrong or controversial about the content this is a good time to point it out.  Also, you have presumably read the entire article, so If you are feeling generous consider writing a summary, tldr, or highlights from the article for the lazier among us.

E) Check the ""[new](/r/raisingkids/new)"" queue to verify that your submission was caught in the spam trap.  If it was marked as spam, message the moderators to let them know.  I try to check the spam trap everyday, but sometime a month goes by with nothing in it so I get lazy and don't check for a few days and then of course that's the day something got caught.

1340055547.0	v8sn9	Need help with my VERY picky eater six year old.	DontTread0nMe	17	0	29	"My six year old son will only eat processed chicken tenders/nuggets, peanut butter sandwiches, pop tarts, and various types of fruits. He absolutely refuses to eat try anything else. Now, before you jump on me with, ""He only eats that because that's what you give him,"" let me give you a little backstory:

I'm in the military, and I've spent half of his life either out of state or overseas. I was gone during his transition from baby foods to solid, and I didn't have much influence on his diet during those important years of his development. I don't blame my wife, she was doing the best she could raising him alone. When I say he refuses, I mean he clams up, starts crying, and will actually vomit up anything you coerce him to try.

We've taken him to see three different pediatricians concerning this issue, and all three gave different advice. One said, ""Physically force him to eat it. He'll figure out if he likes it or not."" Disregarding the psychological damage I might inflict on my son by doing that, he'll automatically psyche himself up to think it's going to taste bad, and he'll immediately spit it out or throw it up if he's made to try it against his will. Another pediatrician suggested, ""Spank him if he doesn't try it. I've got six kids, it's worked on every single one of them--trust me."" I for one do not condone spanking my son unless it seriously warrants it--trying to get him to try a new food isn't one of those times. Again, I don't want to make dinner time a traumatic affair.

On that note, I tried making dinner time a fun affair. I cut his food into fun shapes, I've had him help us make dinner on multiple occasions, I've tried to bribe him with toys and rewards. No dice. I've even lied to him and told him pizza would give him Ninja Turtle super strength. He gagged and vomited it all over the carpet, then freaked out.

I was, and still am, under the impression that unless he's mentally ready and willing to try something new, he'll develop some unfortunate Pavlovian conditioning to fear whatever it is we're making him try. He recoils whenever he sees a box of pizza... But how do I make him WANT to try something new?

Which brings me to what I felt was a last resort, which was blessed off by the last pediatrician he saw: Preparing the same meals for him that my wife and I are eating, and if he doesn't eat it, then he just won't eat.  Worked on me as a child, and the concept of, ""No human will starve themselves to death with food sitting in front of them,"" seems sound. We tried this, and my son refused to eat a thing, holding out for three solid days before breaking down and trying something new. I ensured he was hydrated and taking vitamins, but the emotional toll it took on my wife and her mother was too much to bear. I don't blame them, seeing a 4 or 5 year old acting lethargic and depressed, with sunken in eyes because he hasn't eaten in two or three days makes you want to cry. It feels like child abuse, even though the kid is inflicting it upon himself. The food he broke down for and ate was oatmeal, and he'll eat it now occasionally, but I don't want to put him through the self-imposed fast every time I want him to try a new food item because I'm afraid it'll stunt his growth, or cause my wife to have a breakdown.

He's shorter than kids his age and he has amblyopia. I'm uncertain as to whether those are genetic issues or if it's his unhealthy diet. The rest of my family brushes it off as if we don't know what we're doing. I hear, ""You're not trying hard enough, have you attempted _____?"" I've tried everything I can think of, every trick I can find floating around on parenting websites, but nothing seems to work. Is there anyone on this subreddit that has experienced anything like this? I'm willing to try anything new to get him to expand his diet."	t5_2tb3h	True

Basic set up : wife works full-time, I work part-time.  We live on my wife's family's property with her mom.  Two sons, 8 year old, A, finishing second grade, 6 year old, B, wrapping up half-day kindergarten.  A is a very bright child.  He taught himself to read at 3, and he's consistently tested years ahead of himself in all areas.  We keep him with his age group because we live in a farming area and there aren't any neighborhood kids, so I know that both of their, A's in particular, social skills are somewhat lacking.  I do extra Khan Academy work with him and engage him intellectually at home more than he gets at school.

To be fair, they are both wonderful children, especially at school.  They're the best of friends and get along extremely well together at home.  I always have teachers and staff (it's a small private school) how polite they are.

However, over the last month, A has become rather defiant at home.  Nothing high-handed or mean like you'd expect from a rebellious teen, but just constant, daily disregard of anything that my I say to him.  I've always thought that I have a very good, mutually respectful relationship with my kids.  We talk about EVERYTHING and I've talked to him for hours about this issue.  His general attitude is thankless and remorseless.

I spend way more time with the kids than my wife does and she's been upset for the past two weeks because I've gradually taken away ALL of his special privileges (Netflix, computer, Xbox, and later even educational shows like Beakman's World and even playing on the trampoline) and she thinks I'm being unnecessarily harsh.  Today my wife was at work and A proceeded to break the washing machine (long story), lie about it (which bothers me more than the act itself) and a string of minor occurrences.  My wife gets home from work and I express my frustration.  I don't think it's doing much good to have him sit in the corner half the day, which he did.  She basically takes his side and we agree to talk later.  Come in, eat dinner and afterwards she tells him to get in the shower.  He runs around the house and sneaks out of an open sliding glass door and is playing outside.  I point this out to her and reprimand him.  He showers, comes downstairs and picks up one of B's stuffed animals with a grass skirt that B had put on it.  He makes a comment about taking off the skirt.  My wife, who is on a laptop face-to-face with me, also on a laptop, tells him, no, that's B's toy, leave it alone.  A sits on the couch behind my wife out of my wife.  I wait 15 seconds, IM her and say that I bet he's taken the skirt off anyway.  He did.

Finally, my wife realizes that this is what I have to deal with constantly every day.  It's not usually big stuff like breaking the dishwasher, but it's ""Don't touch that,"" and he touches it.  ""Go get this,"" and he walks off to do something else.  ""No, you may not have a (...),"" and he gets one for himself when no one is looking.

I neither approve nor disapprove of spanking at this age.  I did it when the kids were like two and a pat that I know doesn't really hurt would make them cry.  I bring this up because, in the first few seconds, I have this gut reaction to bend him over my knee like I got as a kid.  I first hand how traumatizing being spanked when the parent/care-giver is angry can be.  I don't want to mess him up, but I'm really running out of ideas.  

I'm normally a peaceful, patient person, but A's attitude has invoked a rage in me that I've never experienced before.  Last week, I talked about this more generally at a support group I attend (AA).  A fellow anon expressed similar feelings about his dealings with his 91 year old mother who lives with him.  We came to the conclusion that you really have to love someone an awful lot for them to enrage you so.  I really love my son and I hate seeing him in trouble all the time.  I know I would cry if I actually did wind up spanking my son.

TL;DR - normally wonderfully-behaved son has suddenly expressed disregard for me as an authority figure.  Need help."	t5_2tb3h	True

I didn't really have anything against him until after they broke up and he got pretty nasty on twitter and facebook. They got back together about 2 weeks ago, I have made it clear to her that he is not welcome in my home. When they are 'together' they are together 24/7. So, she has been staying at his parents' house since they got back together. She comes home every day to get things or wait until he is off work. Last night we had a blowout because she wants him to be able to stay at our house again. She said I am a bitch and making this about me, why can't I get over things he has done if she has, etc. His mom does xyz for me, and on and on. Well, I know she isn't calling his mom a bitch to her face, so its easier for her to be handing out sweeties, honey can I get you anything's. She also got a DUI a month ago, so she is trying to weasel out of paying her cell phone bill that I told her she would be taking over this year. I am loosing it, I am a single parent who’s child support is about to run out in 5 months. She has only paid for car insurance a few times and I have to beg for it. I can’t do this. I have asked friends, but I don’t have any with kids around her age that I agree with their parenting style. I just know that I was a horrific teenager, but I would never treat my parents the way she does. She is twice my size and has come and gone as she pleases for the last 3 years, when she decided she could and would overpower me to get out the door. Last night was all about I’m going to loose her, why do I think we don’t talk, I never buy groceries, and on and on about how I can’t do anything right. Please help.
TL/DR: Daughter is flipping out, causing lots of drama and financial strain.

Considering our relatively low traffic, I felt like this would dominate /r/raisingKids, and asked /u/toytasting to stop. I suggested she start her own community focused on toy reviews and she could promote it here. She asked me to help out because she is new to reddit, so I agreed to help moderate /r/toyreviews.

We plan on having four types of posts:

*    [review] - a review of a toy
*   [request] - asking for a review of a specific toy or type of toy
*    [suggestion] - asking for a gift suggestion (poster describes recipient in post).
*    [meta] - discussions about the community

non-negotiable.  She has to brush her teeth twice a day.  She has to
be in her carseat when the car is moving.  She is not allowed to hit
or kick or there is a timeout.  Other than things like that, we pretty
much work around her desires.  

We use playful parenting techniques and she is pretty good about happily going along with us (i.e. getting dressed, transitions, etc.) with a bit of occasional whining.  But for example, on Saturday we had planned to run some errands.  She just didn't want to leave the house, so instead we stayed home and baked and did laundry, etc. and ran errands the next day.  We are starting to wonder if she is going to be spoiled if we continue to let her desires trump the rest of the family's.  She goes to daycare, so for a substantial portion of the day she has to compromise her desires with her classmates and teachers, but at home it mostly resolves around her.  

When she was younger we had no problem subjugating our desires to hers, but as she gets older we feel she needs to learn to compromise more. What is an appropriate age to begin this transition and how do we do it successfully?

She was crying, telling me that the light turned off and on by itself, and at that moment, my uncle came to the door, nearly laughing his ass off, to tell me he was ""only playing"" with her and shut the light off himself. Needless to say my grandma and I nearly kicked my uncle's ass for almost litteraly scaring the shit out of my niece. 
Ever since then, my niece will not go to the bathroom without someone with her, or without turning on every light in the house (our power bill has gone up because of it) I've tried treating when she goes alone, I even got her a ""magic"" flashlight to ""scare the bad things away"", and have reassured her everyday that nothing is going to happen to her, and that the house is safe. She knows it was great uncle who turned the light off on her, and yet with no matter how much reassurance, she still will not go in by herself.
She doesn't have this problem when she's at home with her mother, only here. She tells me someone keeps telling her about ghosts, but always jumps around about who exactly has been telling her. I've talked to everyone about not telling her such things, but no one has said anything like that to her. Everyone tells her ghosts aren't real, and that there's nothing to be scared of. Yet she'll still insist that someone has to stand in the doorway while she goes, or she'll stand in the hallway and cry until someone turns the light on for her.
She has none of these fears when she's home with her mother, only when she's with me. She'll hardly let me leave the room when she's coloring or playing with toys.
Currently we're sharing a room together (she sleeps on my bed, and I sleep on a pull out bed) and we're planning on cleaning out a spare room, so she'll have her own space, yet she's almost too scared to do anything alone in the house without me or anyone else in the same room. 
I work from home as a freelance artist, and have to spend time a lot of time on the computer, but since my niece can't go potty, or get some water, or basic things by herself, it's really putting me behind on work.
I know this was a traumatic experience for her, yet she knows nothing's going to happen to her here. 
Is there a way I can help her overcome this fear and over-dependence?"	t5_2tb3h	True

Is this something you would like, or do you think it would be a bad idea?  Suggestions for improvement?

------------

In an effort to encourage more good discussion and build our community, I was thinking we could have 3 regularly scheduled posts a week.  This is not like Image Fest Friday (/r/2x) or Wallet Wednesday (/r/parenting) because this is only going to be one post on these days, and people would contribute in the comments.

* **FAQ Friday** - common parenting questions. i.e. good books, movies, websites, baby gear, etc.  The FAQ Friday threads would get recorded on the wiki. The 1st FAQ Friday question could be ""what questions should we use for FAQ Fridays"".   

* **Accomplishment Tuesday** - Arts &amp; crafts and any DIY stuff you are proud off, goals met, awards won, something good that happened to you this week or something that emphasized the positive things in parenting. 

* **Problem Solving Sunday**  - Post your current dilemma with your kids and offer offer suggestions to others.

Not to discourage other discrete posts of these types, but I thought it might encourage people who would be too intimidated to make a post of their own.

He has a fair amount of toys and our upstairs is babyproofed to the point that he can explore as he wishes for the most part, but I can't help but feel like there is more I could be doing with him.

1363767051.0	1anics	Steubenville mother's statement reflects part of the problem.	timtamtyrant	26	14	16	"A statement made by the victim's mother:
“Human compassion is not taught by a teacher, a coach or a parent, it is a God-given gift instilled in all of us. You displayed not only a lack of this compassion but a lack of any moral code.”

Let me just say at the start - I have no intention of baiting or whatever. I have complete sympathy for the victim for not only the callousness of how she was initially abused, but also the lack of bystanders (people she knew as friends?!) stepping in to stop it, and how she seems to have been ostrasized by her own community since. 

I just think a mentality of 'these things you should already inherently know, no one else should need to teach you' is a big part of the problem. And there is no better time to address it than now. There is no better statement to rebut that mentality than that of the VICTIM'S OWN MOTHER, (for goodness sakes!)

This attitude does not bear up, for whatever reason you have to believe it whether it be religion or whatever. It's a cop out.

Before the existance of schooling how were children taught? They were mentored. Apprenticed. They were placed under the supervision of an adult and learned the cues of supposedly appropriate behaviour from that adult.

Parents of toddlers should be able to attest to this because of the way toddlers tend mimic their mum and dad's affectations.

There is an old saying - it takes a community to raise a child. It's not because the child has ADHD. It's because the child learns from the examples the adult around him/her set. Their codes of behaviour. How those individuals with poor behaviour are demonised. Etcetera.

So what happens now that we have public school systems?

Children, at the age of 5 or so - an age when they are typically still competing to gain attention (and in some cases still haven't mastered the art of using the toilet) instead of being at an age where they have learned to pay attention to others are chucked in together as if in a zoo.

I'm not dismissing the role of teachers - I have a lot of respect for teachers.

What I am pointing out is when you replace a child having to learn their cues from adults with a system that puts a mess of children still at an age where they want attention from others altogether to learn FROM EACH OTHER, you will have an environment where they are not learning how to grow up. You have them in an environment where they are instead competing to get the most attention against other little monsters with the same goal.

Are we really so surprised our children are growing up:
- to be trolls? People who post truly hateful comments just so to get attention?
- to be people who use the term 'rape' as a supposedly funny (or at least everyday) term to use to express gaming domination?
- to be people who go about crying 'SOCIALIST!' for any policy that might be for the common good rather than a personal windfall for themselves?
- to be people who think any behaviour is excusable when defending or advancing the interests of themselves or their own?

The worst part of it all is it becomes a self-sustaining system of poor behaviour. If a few get ahead by stepping on others and are not held accountable, the others will soon learn they have to do the same thing just to survive and not be left behind.

Civil behaviour. Morality. These things are not inherent in our make-up. They are things that are LEARNED.

If teachers, coaches and parents aren't teaching them ... then where are the kids learning their standards of behaviour?

Answer: from each other.

First off, he was the product of a one night stand.  Not his fault but I was alone in raising him from the start which was fine with me.  He has always been ""delayed"", he just wouldn't do the things his peers did, ever.  He wouldn't walk or talk until he was almost 3 years old.  I begged for help for him and we completed every therapy available.  The therapist and doctors encouraged me to put him in preschool to help him gain social skills and progress his other skills.  It didn't help and things have only gotten worse.  He's 8 years old now in the 2nd grade and it will be a miracle if he passes this year.  His attitude and behavior are horrible and I've tried every thing I know to do to help him, nothing helps.  He can make something simple take an hour and an arguement.  He has made one friend and that childs mother asked me not to send him back to her home.    

My day starts with getting him ready for school; this morning, I almost lost it on him.  He refuses to put his clothes on, send him twice to brush his teeth, he throws a fit over his clothes and because I tried to comb his hair.  He defies every request.  He can't/won't tie his shoes and finding his coat and backpack is like new news to him.  By the time I get him to school, I just want to pull over and cry.  Sadly, as I pull away, I feel relieved; he's someone elses problem for a little while.  When he comes home, he starts as soon as he clears the door.  He starts asking to go to his friends house (the childs mother asked me not to send him, she said he doesn't play with the kid when he's there anyway) so I try to get him started on homework.  It takes about an hour or two of begging, pleading, making, etc. to get him to attempt 20 minutes of homework.  Most of the time, it has to be redone (another 2 hour fight) to get him to fix the wrong answers.  He just writes down anything.  His school work is a MAJOR stressor in my life.  Picking him up from school is enough to give me a panic attack.  I never know what lies he's told them about me because I tried to get him there on time that morning or what kind of hell he's put his teacher through that day.  Yesterday, she was in tears when I picked him up.  If I go in to get him, I take the risk of 3 hour long parent teacher conferences and if I let him come to the car, she follows him out to tell me what he did.  He is horrible to his classmates!  He's a bully to the little girls.  I've had parents call me to tell me that my child made their kid cry or said this or that.  I've been flagged down in the road so they could tell me.  He thinks its funny.  I could go on and on about all the things he does, says, etc.  I've never witnessed a kid so evil.  He thinks its hilarious to get me so frustrated that I just cry.  Then, when I get mad at him, he tells me how bad of a mom I am and that I hate him and on and on.  I love him because he's my kid but I don't like him.

I wish that I had never had kids and if I had it do over, I wouldn't.  I'm scared for his future.  I've tried everything I know to do.  I've went in tears to his principal, teacher, doctor, therapist and anyone who would listen to plead for some help.  I feel like I'm raising a demon who's main goal is to destroy me.  His dad is no help (occupied with his new family) and my parents think he hung the moon.  All I hear is ""All kids are mean"", well, they're not.  His brother isn't and no one else I know has to deal with anything like I do.  I resent him so much because I know what he is and how he treats me and no one else believes me.  I work incredibly hard to give him a great life and he just demands more.  Nothing is good enough for him, we go on vacations and on the way home, he tells me how much it sucked and goes on and on about things we didn't do/buy.  Disney world wasn't good enough for him last year.  I don't even want to take him this year.  Its not a vacation for me.  When I was little, a good spanking done kids good but he already lies so bad that I'm afraid to, he'll go to school and tell him I beat him to death.  I tried to turn him around this morning to fix his hair and he accused me of trying to strangle him.  The thing is, I'm afraid I'm going to.  I'm terrified of losing my cool and snapping on him and hurting him.  I just keep thinking ""10 more years"" and I can have my life back.  But honestly, the thought of him being an adult scares me worse than anything else.  I'm afraid his life will lead to jail or worse.  He is amused by causing other people pain, hurt, etc. and thinks its hilarious if he can make you cry.  He tells little girls at school their hair looks stupid, his teacher she looks like a whale.  He isn't even allowed to play sports.  We've tried them all and he either refuses to participate and sits on the ground or he's so mean to the teammates that the coach asked me not to bring him back.  His whole world is video games and I monitor what games he gets, no need to give him any ideas!  But he stays grounded from them 99% of the time.

BTW, I remarried when he was 3 and his step dad is the ONLY person that can do anything with him, but he works alot so most of the time, I'm on my own with him.  We have another son who is incredibly smart and well behaved, an angel child.  He's horrible and mean to him so the younger stays with his grandma most of the time.  My husband tells me to just send him to his dad, but I don't want to do that.  I don't want to give up on him.  I just don't know what to do.  I feel so guilty for even having these thoughts toward a child, but I really don't like him.  I don't know how I'm supposed to survive another 10 years!  I would love to just run off somewhere, all I want to be is a missing person!  But I can't do that to my other child or my husband.  Maybe I just need a break but they're never long enough.  I don't know what to do, I spend my life in terror because I feel like I'm raising a psychopath!          "	t5_2tb3h	True

I started another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/15ohql/question_for_a_new_comer_to_anitconsumption/) on anti-consumption that is related to this. 

We are already what I would consider frugal and mindful of not buying unneeded items. Pre-children we didn't even fuss with Christmas for a few years and I personally found it liberating. We now have kids and have allowed ourselves to do the Santa bit. I tried to keep it reasonable and only bought items I knew they would really value and use. So in the end I think I did ok. Lot's of books for my 6 year old and the likes.

I'm curious to hear from those of you who are parents and have adopted anitconsumption or frugal as your way, how do you navigate this with your kids. 

I just recently bought something called [moonjar](http://www.moonjar.com/) which so far I really like. It's a program to teach kids about money. We haven't finished reading the material yet, but I think this is a great start. I told my 6 year old that I would no longer buy things for her ""just because"", but she will still have her needs met. I'm trying to set her up to learn how to create income producing opportunities for herself.

Additionally, I grew up on a farm. In that environment there was the attitude that you did chores to help the family. I never had an allowance and frankly was never taught money management. With that in my background I have found myself sharing the same thought that helping around the house is helping the family. I've been trying to think of how to teach the helping aspect, but also marry the earn your own money piece. The only idea I have come up with so far is that if she does a responsibility that I would normally have to do she could earn something... but I'm honestly not sure what is best. I've seen a ton of ideas around this, but they all seem like they are missing something. 

Have you gone through this and if so what have you done?"	t5_2tb3h	True

He is a very smart boy, has a lot of creativity in the arts, and drama, but when it comes time to do homework, I am ready to pull out my hair. 
He has 2 younger brothers, one is 8 and has PDD-NOS, and his other is 4 and has Global Development Delay. ""A"" has never been diagnosed as having delays or anything, but he shows a strong difficulty in retaining information. This makes homework very difficult for the both of us. He has difficulty with his fine and gross motor skills (writing, cutting, gluing, coordination, etc). He has had an occupational therapist in school to help him improve in these areas and has shown improvement, but it still seems to hold him back with his work. He still fumbles on letters, and numbers, his mind works faster than his hands in some cases. Even in the case of typing out his thoughts. When it comes to doing math homework, he just hates it, and sits there and refuses to try, and gets increasingly frustrated with it. I have run out of ways to help him, and can't think of any ways to make this fun. I get frustrated trying to help him because he yells at me, throws his pencil, argues, and makes it hell trying to do work with him. 
Also, the school has him on a waiting list for an edu-psycological assessment to see if there are any underlying, undiagnosed issues (costs nearly $2000 privately, so we need to wait for the school to do it)

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!

 My bf had a son with his ex a little under a year before I met him. He was paying her child support and would go see his kid at her parents house because she wasn't raising the child and basically set all the rules. It turned out all the money he was giving to her wasn't going to her parents and she got mad at them and told them to bring all his things to us..that she would go get him. Never told us anything.We didn't hear from her again until we got a text a month later saying if we didn't give her child support we wouldn't be able to see him.
 We filed and gained temporary custody.  Took him to a new dr who suggested us to child development because he was behind. Eventually a deal was worked out in which. If she could pass a drug test and prove her house was suitable then she could have him every other Monday and bring him back Tuesday. Also every Thursday night. We never received a call from lawyer saying she did this. We let her come over on mothers day to see him because that's the only time she's asked.

She has however, harassed constantly...claiming that we neglect and abuse him and that we shouldn't let him be around her parents because they abuse him(which I have never seen any credence of). She hasn't paid any child support. She hasn't even given him anything since he's been here almost 7 months now. She's only asked to see him 4 times in that time. I have every text from myself and my bfs mom. Her Lawyer dropped her as a client and she still hasn't even taken the drug test. When she was over here last she told us that she had no hot water. She admitted to trying cocaine when she was pregnant with him.  
  I am staying home with him. We're working on signing,which he is doing very well at because at 19 months because  he can't say anything other than mama and dadda. He sees a speech pathologist every other week, as well as a fine motor specialist every other week. I watched him walk to me for the first time and got a huge pang of guilt because I'm not his mom and she's not willing to listen apparently.
On mothers day, we told her that he was walking. we told her that he's started to speak and finally stand on his own. 
  She send a text the other day asking when we were planning on telling her that he could speak. She's also now claiming that she has asked repeatedly if she can see him. She hasn't. She says we're keeping him from her. Jeremy finally told her that she has not asked and he's not going to force her to take an interest in her sons life
  Her anger problem is the reason I'm afraid of letting him stay with her without supervision. I use the drug test as an excuse but I also know she's on them as well. The bruises on her arm that she claimed her ""dentist"" gave her , seem to be proof of that. Do dentist give you shots on the arm. I'm curious about that, mine have never done that. Also she seems to want nothing to do with me, even though I'm the one that sees her child 90% of the time. Calling me names and a downgrade because she has depression problems. 
  My number one problem with this is that I believe. I've read the messages, on how she cries when she sees his crib. On how she has toys he's never played with. On how she wishes Jeremy wouldn't have ruined her life. She got a new roommate recently and I believe she was evicted from her last apartment. Honestly I think she's a suicide risk, but I haven't spoken more than three words to her. Is there any way I could get her help?
 I sometimes wonder if I love her son more than she does, I also worry that when she gets him she won't be able to deal with the temper tantrums that so often come when a child reaches that toddler stage.  Jeremy used to tell me that he would work 16 hr days and come home and she's have him in his crib all day while she played farmville everything scheduled including diaper changes every hour if he needed them or not. that she would give him up and leave as soon as he got there. This child doesn't deserve this and she keeps adding drama. I thought maybe after the hearing that she would accept it and stop harrassing it's not the case. I wish he knew her. I don't wish harm on her but I think she's very delusional and she projects claiming abuse on anyone who does her wrong. while going through the hearing she filed a restraining order on him and had no evidence, was thrown out immediately but she refuses to accept still claiming. still saying she has asked to see him. Even bringing herself to tears. I know I'm rambling and I know it makes no sense  but how can I help her? and how can I ignore her? it's impossible to do both and yet I really want to"	t5_2tb3h	True

This is the first FAQ Friday, hopefully it will be fun.  The idea here is to generate content for our [FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/raisingkids/faq).

Here are the ""rules"" for FAQ Friday:

* Recommendations should be put in top level comments.
* 1 suggestion per comment.
* Top 10 comments in each age range with at least a score of 2 will get copied into the FAQ
* In your comment identify which age range it is for (if appropriate)

This is one post where you can ignore reddiquette and just vote up/down based upon whether you agree with the recommendation.

I will probably wait until Tuesday or so to give everyone a chance to post and vote.  I'll edit this post once the voting has 'closed'."	t5_2tb3h	True

You can see the outline at [/r/raisingkids/faq](http://reddit.com/r/raisingkids/faq), and I'll add it to our sidebar once there is more to it.  Not much there yet, but I hope to add additional content over the coming months.

One way I hope to generate content for our FAQ is by instituting 'FAQ Fridays'  Basically each Friday I'll post a question (generally recommendations for parenting related products, e.g. kids music, tv. shows, parenting books, etc.), and then after a few days I'll take the top voted answers and put them into the FAQ.

Take a look at the FAQ to see the ideas for categories I have so far.  This Friday will be our first FAQ Friday, so if you want to suggest other topics or have a preference on which ones we do first, please post here.  

Here are the tentative rules for FAQ Friday:

Lately, we can't leave anywhere without a huge meltdown by both of us.   We were at an indoor play spot the other day with some friends, and my newborn had a massive blowout from her diaper.  Poop everywhere up her neck and down out the leg hole.  I changed her diaper and her outfit... and then the new diaper leaked, so her new pants were all wet and I didn't have another change of clothes. I let my son know we'd need to leave soon and that he could play 2 more things, then I changed her diaper and told my 2.5-yr-old son we had to leave.  He was running away, crying, doing everything he could to keep me from catching him.  I end up grabbing his arm, nearly dragging him out, the whole time with him kicking and screaming.  I was wearing the baby, otherwise I'd have picked him up and carried him like I used to do.  This happened last week at a playdate at the library.  He couldn't leave the train table.  Talking to him normally helps, but he completey ignores me in these situations when he's all worked up emotionally.  I'm dreading taking him to parks this summer with big open spaces, and we need a solution!  Thanks."	t5_2tb3h	True

Or perhaps someone has an answer for my situation off the top of your head, because you are Canadian and in my same situation.

I'm carless-by-choice Canadian, living in a major urban center near the subway. We have a zip car membership and rent cars when needed. We also take cabs sometimes. 

Right now we are sitting pretty with a Graco Snugride 35 and a shortish 11 month old. He's still got an inch or two before his head is an inch below the top of the seat, but growth spurts happen and we have to start thinking now about the next steps.

I want to find a rear facing seat or combination seat that installs easily in different vehicles. The two seats recommended for this purpose on [The Car Seat Lady](http://www.thecarseatlady.com/taxis/using_taxis_2.html), do not appear to be available in Canada. I would love to find one that is - bonus points if it can be strapped to a stroller frame with bungies or whatever.

So - anybody have a solution to my little problem? When I was pregnant, my husband and I had a good laugh over the idea of buying a car so we would have somewhere to store the carseat. I don't want this joke to become a reality.

As a side question - has anyone here successfully managed having two or three kids without having a car? We're thinking of trying for a second in the next year or so, and while it has been surprisingly easy to have one without a car, we always knew that two might be where we break. Has anyone else managed it?"	t5_2tb3h	True

1354670845.0	14anru	5 year old and tantrums		16	6	6	"**Update**: Thank you so much for all of your advice! We have been making sure to set aside time after school everyday with just the three of us (my son, husband and myself). This seems to be helping out a bit as he hasn't been throwing fits as often in the past week. This is something we will still have to work on but thanks to the suggestions you all have provided, we feel better prepared to deal with his tantrums. I apologize for not responding sooner but we have been extremely busy with our semesters coming to an end and dealing with finals. Again, thank you all so much for your advice and kind words! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*I had submitted this to the /r/parenting but I think that I might get more responses here. Sorry for the length of this post. I wanted to give as much information as possible to get helpful replies back. Thank you for reading!*

My husband and I seem to be having some problems with our five year old son. He just started kindergarten this year (2 years of preschool before). Since the beginning of the semester, he has been throwing these extreme tantrums. I don't know if it has anything to do with school or our home life or if there is something else wrong.

We also have a two year old and babysit two other school-age children for a few hours after school. They all play together and seem to have fun but if something doesn't go my sons way, he starts screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. In between screams, he begins wailing uncontrollably. This has never been a problem before. He is usually very well mannered. He behaves well at school and in public, but at home he is an absolute mess!

His latest tantrum was because the other kid I babysit (6 year-old boy) decided to call something by a name other than what it really was (he was pretending). My son didn't like that and began screaming at him and then that progressed into the wailing, screaming, yelling tantrum. I made him stay in his room until the fit was over. This lasted for approximately 20 minutes. I went to check on him when he was done and he had destroyed his bedroom. Toys everywhere and his bed stripped bare with everything on the floor. Putting him in the corner has given similar results with him throwing himself down into the corner and yelling. He has also taken to name calling but I am sure that is just the age.

Some background on parents: My husband and I have pretty short tempers. We can be quick to yell but we never hit the kids unless they need a swat on the butt (when nothing else works!). This has been something we are working on with both of us keeping each other in check (one of us always seems to be more calm than the other). You would think that without as much yelling on our part, he would straighten out. He has only gotten worse.

I have no idea what to do anymore. I send him to his room now when he starts throwing fits but they continue for extended periods of time until he wears himself out and then my husband or myself will go in to talk to him. Usually, if he has had one tantrum, he will continue these tantrums throughout the day. This doesn't happen everyday, but it is often enough to be completely stressing me out. Should I continue doing this and hope that eventually he will realize that his behavior won't solve his problems? Are there any other tactics I should try that may produce better results? Could there be some underlying problem?

Also, I just remembered something that might be useful. He was premature and as such is slightly developmentally behind (speech, motor skills, etc.). He wasn't fully potty trained until 4 yrs old (using the toilet more often than having accidents and being able to clean himself up). He continued to have accidents (too preoccupied or lazy to go to the bathroom?) but eventually those became fewer and fewer until he was having no accidents for a couple of months. Then all of a sudden he had 5 accidents in one week (2 of them in one day) and continued to have a few accidents in the next week. I don't know if this will be helpful or not.

**TL;DR**-- 5 yr old throwing epic tantrums all of a sudden, no idea what to do anymore!

Edit: Also, not sure if this belongs here or if there is a better place to move this."	t5_2tb3h	True

My just turned 4 year old has been playing mainly ""non educational"" adventure games and sim toys on our iPad for over a year for her 1 hour of quiet time every afternoon.

Here's my quick list of some that have been impressive:

* [Putt Putt Saves the Zoo](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/putt-putt-saves-the-zoo/id511499384?mt=8) - Adapted from the PC CD-ROM of the early 90s. Great cartoon graphics, excellent harmless story line. Kid solved the game in one massive unprecedented gaming session while fighting a nasty cold last winter.

* [Freddi Fish](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freddi-fish-stolen-shell/id511501137?mt=8) - Also an old Atari game from the 90s. Same deal as above.

* [Machinarium](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/machinarium/id459189186?mt=8) - Great indy game. Kid love it but needed lots of help. She still goes though and play the levels that she can solve.

* [Where's my Water](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wheres-my-water/id449735650?mt=8) - Fairly popular but pretty good problems solving (sort of teaches sequencing this before that, basic fluid dynamics).

* [My Playhome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-playhome/id439628153?mt=8) - Fun little sim doll house. She plays with it exactly like she does with her real doll house.

* All the Toca Boca toys including Build a Robot, Toca Kitchen, Birthday Party and Tea party.

Just thought I'd share. Does anyone else have any really nicely done games / toys that their kids love?

The child in question is 6, F. I'm her (almost) step-mom - engaged to her dad. She and her brother live with their mom the majority of the time; we only have them on holiday breaks and for the summer.

I'm honestly not sure what the problem is, but no matter how much we monitor her bathroom use (reminding her to go, asking her if she needs to if she's squirming, etc.) and explain to her/remind her to wipe afterward, she's always wet at the end of the day. Not like she outright peed herself; more like it's just built up over the day. It's definitely pee and not sweat - she and her clothes smell pretty strongly once they've reached that point.

I've asked her dad if she's been checked out for incontinence, and that's been ruled out. She also has a problem with bedwetting, if that's relevant - her younger brother has significantly less of an issue with it.

Her dad feels that she's simply not cleaning up well enough when she uses the bathroom. If indeed that is the case, how can we motivate her to do better? I know that she knows how to, but if that's the problem, then obviously just being reminded and told to isn't enough. Would a reward system work?

Up 'til now, I've just been telling myself that it'll get better as she gets older, but it's getting to a point where I'm worried. I'm afraid that kids at her school will make fun of her if she smells bad, and I'm also a little worried that this could indicate some kind of abuse."	t5_2tb3h	True

We recently reached 1000 subscribers, which while dwarfed by many reddits, is a number I was not sure /r/raisingKids would ever reach, much less in only 4 months.   This post is our chance to talk about what we want out of this community and what we can do to improve it.

I think this is a good time to talk about what distinguishes /r/raisingKids from the other general interest parenting communities, which is our 'moderation'. I put that in quotes, because so far, other than blocking a few spammers I have not had to do much moderation.  Our sidebar defines in broad terms the behavior we expect from our community, and so far everyone has complied.  But what works for a small community may not work so well for a larger community, so I think now is a good time to more concretely define our standards.

Although moderation is important in /r/raisingKids I hope that it will be needed rarely, and I want it to be done as openly as possible.

In my mind the #1 rule of our community is to follow rediquette.  This is primarily 1) be polite and 2) encourage interesting discussions.

Politeness, or the flip side, disrespect, is in the eye of the beholder and covers a spectrum of behavior.  Rather than try to define exactly what is encouraged, allowed, and disallowed, I thought some examples might provide better insight:

I saw a post a few weeks ago on another community that I think is a good example of what is not acceptable here.  There was a disagreement about something, and a comment to a pregnant woman said that they hoped she fell down some stairs and had a miscarriage.  This is 100% unacceptable, and if a moderator sees something like that here, it will result an in instant ban.  Please report posts like this if you see them.

On the other hand, calling someone an idiot, or other name calling will not result in a ban, unless it is excessive, in which case a warning would be given first.  I would however downvote any mean, nasty posts like that, and I hope others would also.

The 2nd part of rediquette (encouraging good discussions), is not something I can enforce as a moderator. I just ask all of you to not downvote something just because you disagree with it (also good not to upvote solely because you agree with a post). If a post is well sourced, makes interesting points, and/or presents a minority opinion please upvote it even if you do not personally agree.  It is better to upvote and then reply with your criticisms, then to downvote and move on.


The second distinguishing characteristic of /r/raisingKids is the rejection of Low Investment Material. I could go off on a rant about this, but if you have been around Reddit for any length of time you can see how not explicitly banning this material leads to it crowding out material of more depth.  Communities as diverse as  /r/scrubs, /r/weightroom, and /r/games have instituted similar rules, which shows how pervasive this problem is.  So far I have not needed to remove many posts for breaking this rule.  I think another good guideline for what content is appropriate for /r/raisingKids, is ""could this help to make someone a better parent?""

Some communities have an auxiliary reddit where they track any moderator activities, and I am curious whether anyone thinks that would be a good idea for us.  For example, we could create /r/removedFromRaisingKids and anytime a post or comment is removed via moderation, the moderators would make a post in r/RFRK to document it.

I think I've rambled long enough, so please let me know what do you think we are doing right, and what could we do better?  How would you like to see /r/raisingKids evolve?"	t5_2tb3h	True
1335908956.0	t26ci	How do I deal with the jealousy and misbehavior associated with introducing a new child into the home?	Yellow_Vespa	9	0	6	"Last summer my younger cousin came to live with us when her father wasn't able to care for her while he worked a job and went to university. She is the same age as my younger sister (6 years old) and at first things were just peachy. The two hit off and became best friends. My sister, who was the baby of the family, was usually bored and lonely at home because there were few children in the neighborhood and my brother and I had a serious difficulty playing with someone more than 10 years our junior (we're just teenagers), so when my cousin became her playmate it was a big relief.
   
My cousin, when she arrived was a bit spoiled and impolite; she was used to her father and grandmother giving her things simply to appease her. She was disruptive in school and constantly got reprimanded or chastised by the teacher for her back talking. My parents who would have none of that, disciplined her (the harshest punishment she got was no t.v. for two days and the occasional time-out). My sister, much to my surprise and shock, was delighted to see my cousin's misfortune. She seemed to pride herself on being the ""good kid"".

After my cousin started behaving with more respect my sister's behavior took a turn for the worst. She throws tantrums, stomps, screams, and rolls her eyes. If she is ever punished she takes it as a personal insult. She asks whether or not we love her anymore or states that we hate her. If we give any praise to my cousin, she will ask ""what about me?"". She has now started to even bully my cousin at times by calling her names, which is against everything we have ever taught her.

I realize I am only her older sibling and not a parent but I had a great deal to do with her development and discipline before my cousin arrived and now I help my parents care for both of them. I desperately need your help because she has never acted this before and since I am an important role model to my sister I thought I could help.I think her behavior is out of jealousy of the love and attention we give to my cousin. Is there anyway to assure my sister she is not loved any less and to stop her bad behavior without making her feel my family is against her?

At two they were able to climb out of their crib and mess up things in their room, we attempted to fix this by getting them big boy bed and starting a nighttime routine. For months my husband or I sat in the room with them until they fell asleep. We were forced to baby gate their  door when they started leaving their room and wandering to other parts of the house.

Recently they've decided to shift their beds around and climb on top of them and jump off. They've also been pulling all of the drawers out of their dresser and pulling everything out of the dresser. To combat this I took away their bed frame and put their dresser in the closet and locked their closet. 

This morning they woke up, broke into their closet and pulled everything out again.

This isn't a matter of waking up before them they will do this between 1-4 AM. there is just no way for me to predict when they're going to do it.

I am frustrated and can't think of anything else to do. I feel like I set them up for success and they still aren't listening. I've also done reward charts, simply talking to them, splitting them up into separate rooms and nothing changes. 

TLDR: kids won't stop destroying room, no matter what I do. "	t5_2tb3h	True

1364530994.0	1b83cq	[meta] Updates to the Sidebar &amp; Wiki &amp; Flair	ozyman	13	4	3	"I've updated the sidebar and want to explain the changes and give a chance for community feedback.  Please upvote this post to provide increased visibility.  No karma is earned for upvotes because it is a self post.

The biggest change was cleaning up the list of other parenting communities.  I added a section for 'new' communities to help give communities less than six months old a better chance to get established.   I also removed less active communities (12 posts or less in the last 4 months), and the ones more for teenagers and/or kids.  A full list of parenting-related communities is on the wiki:
http://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/wiki/parentingcommunities

Let me know if you know of any parenting communities our list is missing so that I can add them.

Reddit recently improved their wiki functionality quite a bit.  The previous wiki was horrible, but the new one looks great.  Hopefully we will think of some ways to put it to good use.
Currently the ability to edit the wiki is open to active members of /r/raisingKids.  I currently have this set to anyone whose account is at least a year old &amp; has at least 100 karma in /r/raisingKids
(i.e. only karma earned in this community counts toward that goal).  I imagine that is a fairly small group of people at this point.  If you can convince me you should have access to the wiki, I can also add people on an individual basis.

The (mostly empty) wiki is at: http://www.reddit.com/r/raisingkids/wiki/index

I also removed the section about Flair from the sidebar.  Over the last year, there have only been a couple of people that have written requesting flair, so I think we should change the way we are using flair.  I'm looking for suggestions and feedback on how we use flair.  I could open up flair to let everyone edit their own.   IMO, this makes things look sloppy as everyone's flair looks different.  Even if we allow everyone to set their own flair, maybe we could have some suggested templates.  Or the mods could give out Flair as a reward to active users.  For example, we could have 'Best Comment', 'Best Post', 'Most Posts', etc.  We could change this every month to recognize new users.  Unfortunately I'm not sure about any automated ways to figure out (for example) who earned the most comment karma in a month, etc., so it would have to be something fairly simple for the mods to calculate.

I'm still learning how reddit flair works, so let me know if you have suggestions.

We've tried to discourage it, but nothing has worked. His Dentist said it's fine and he'll outgrow it eventually. 

The thing that bothers me though, is he is developing an open bite. There is a finger-sized gap in his grin where his teeth don't meet. I've already come to terms with the fact that he'll need braces, but I don't want him to have a weird bite when he gets older.

So any advice, experience, tips would be interesting to hear."	t5_2tb3h	True

1341767047.0	w85yw	Gentle discipline / positive parenting advice - what type of behavior to expect in pre-verbal toddler boys?		9	2	28	"We just spent time with family and I am feeling a little apprehensive about what we can expect in the next few years. My son is 5.5 months and the behavior of his 21 month old cousin has me worried. I'd love to get perspective from parents who practice positive parenting / gentle discipline.

My 21 month old cousin basically spends his time at other folks' houses being tailed by a parent while he leaves a path of destruction...dirty hand prints on windows and white trim ledges, broken doggy door, broken door stopper, etc. He isn't really entertained by toys but likes to explore and see how things work. He is very keen to push limits and pretty much ignores verbal communication about his behavior. The parents don't say ""no"" but they do say things like ""we don't play with x.""

I expect at home that we will create a safe, toddler proof environment. At the same time, I'll want to take my son out in public. My mom has a wall of windows between the living room and inviting, child-friendly backyard that they get professionally washed. Going into parenting, I expected that with work I could guide my son to not smear the windows in every visit, for instance. 

From the outside it looks like the 21 month old exhibits the worst behavior when he is over-tired. It also seems like he needs safe, fun activities to play with at my mom's - when I suggested going in on something to keep the kids entertained the parents looked at me hopelessly and said it wouldn't work because the kid likes to explore. I'm thinking something like a sand box and/or water, ride ons, legos, race tracks, play structures, etc. My parents already have a sandy area for their dog to dig in but the parents wouldn't let the boy play there because they didn't want him to clean him up.

Is my mom just going to have to live with smeared windows and broken things throughout the house, or is it reasonable to expect that gentle discipline / positive parenting will be useful in helping my son not behave like a feral animal when we are out in public?  I've seen this behavior in lots of boys under three and it terrifies me...

On a side note I am doing signs with my son and the 21 month old knows some signs.

EDIT other than the windows, my mon's house is pretty baby proof. She is a clutter free neat freak. She puts a gate up in front of the tv and a shelf she has with crystal. The broken [door stopper](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zeKyrwHqsWw/TkBi-QxdspI/AAAAAAAAAb4/ZO7VsDp5dWM/s1600/ugly+doorstop.jpg) and [pet door](http://retractablescreensrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Pet-Panel.jpg) (plastic stretched out on sides so no longer keeps hot/cold air out) are structural elements of the home.

We have a 20 month old boy at home, who was an absolute dream baby. Slept through the night at 4 weeks, never a picky eater, entirely lovable, funny, and smart. &lt;/brag&gt;

That said, our second son was born the 6th, and after an extended stay at the hospital for some weight loss issues (he was still a 9 lb baby, no real worries there), we finally got to bring him home on Monday. 

After all that time between the grandparents watching him, and with the addition of a new baby, our first son is having a hard time getting back into a routine. He's great with the newborn, but with us he is petulant, cranky, and *may* have eaten one or two full meals worth of food in the last couple days. Weird side effect: also wants milk all the time now (he only gets milk right before bed now). Most likely this comes from seeing his brother get his bottle that we have to supplement with, so that's no big deal, just odd.

I was just wondering, as I am sure some of you have faced this problem: do you have any suggestions as to how I can help my son get used to this new presence in the house, this new routine? I am being patient with him because I am sure it is hard, but it hurts to see him so upset, and I hope I can help resolve it soon.

I have a couple ideas I want to spit ball with you fine folks. Please let me know the error in my thinking or what you would do differently .

1. Debate with my children - When I was young I remember being told I couldn't do something because ""I said so."" Now, I love my parents and know they did the best they knew how, but I SERIOUSLY dislike that answer. I recently had the idea, if s/he comes up to me asking to do something, if I'm against the idea, why not tell him/her to get their thoughts together, print up some notes or research and we'll have an informal debate and if they can convince me, I'll let them do it.

2. Quiz - I've heard that younger children will obsessively as questions about everything around them. It also seems that they don't really listen to the answer or quickly forget it. Why not randomly ask them the same questions and try to reinforce these tid-bits of knowledge. 

3. Decision making with the Wife - My long time girlfriend and I often have differences of opinion on parenting scenarios. I'll ask a question like ""What happens if our child gets in a fight at school?"" And she'll give an answer that I don't find complete and so I'll keep adding to the scenario. This type of discussion infuriates her and we'll end the conversation prematurely. What if instead of discussing these topics point blank, writing a page or note with all my thoughts and letting her read it and reply via note. This would let us communicate without any undertone or becoming heated.

I have more but don't want anymore wall of text. Thanks for responding! "	t5_2tb3h	True

Last week I was at a small town BBQ for a friend who is getting married.  It was on a farm and other local farmers and family were invited.  There was a girl there about 9 or 10 giving hugs to people.  I assumed she knew them or was related to them.  After a while I was starting to think she was doing it just when her parents were introducing her to people they knew.  Then I realized she was actually going up to random strangers and hugging them.  Sometimes sneaking up behind them and hugging them.  Her parents seemed to be quite comfortable with the fact that she does this, however, it was very awkward and to me breaks some sort of stranger/child boundaries.  


In this day and age, it seemed very strange to me to have a a girl at that age being that open to strangers.  Without judging the parents (it's their choice how they raise their daughter) I feel like they have missed teaching their daughter normal social cues and to be more cautious with strangers.  


What are your thoughts on this?  And how do you teach your child to be cautious of strangers without causing them to fear them?

They're my stepchildren, and they live with their mom the majority of the time.  They're just turning 5 and 6 - boy and girl, respectively.  Whenever they see something they want, be it on TV, walking through a store, or just about anywhere, of course they want it.  I can understand that, I was a kid too.  But it's extremely painful for me to always have to say no.  I feel like a complete failure as a parent.  Being kids, they'll attempt to convince me by telling me how much they like whatever it is and how much fun it is.  Again - I completely understand where they're coming from, but it's hard not to die inside a little bit when this happens.  

Recently my stepdaughter has been begging to go to a waterpark.  I've told her that we can't afford to do it.  Her response - ""Why don't you just get some money?""  I know they're too young to understand the concept of money at all, and my husband and I have discussed some different ways we can start to teach them, but this is probably the most hurtful thing of all.  I work my butt off at a job I hate.  I usually need a good half hour to cry when I get home, because there's no other way to let off the stress.  Hearing that response is just like a slap in the face, intended or not - it's like being told that I'm just not good enough.  

I grew up in a middle class family, but my mom NEVER let us ask for things.  It was punishable, in fact - if we asked for things in a store, then we were in pretty serious trouble, *especially* if we pressed.  Asking for something was almost a guarantee that we wouldn't get it.  I don't completely agree with this approach, as I now have difficulty as an adult asking for things that I legitimately need, but I can also see where she was coming from on this.  

Is there a happy medium?  I want them to know that it's okay to ask for something - once - but that it's also important to accept the answer.  "	t5_2tb3h	True

Husband states he just isn't happy and that they are just too different. He is basically a D-Bag and wants her to live like they are in MadMen. Two boys 7 &amp; 9 caught in the wreckage. 

Husband took care of all the finances so now my sister is struggling to get the all the financial details for the divorce agreement. She is educated and can make decent money on her own. Husband did little parenting, has little desire to do any after the separation.

They both have lawyers, he has officially filed. He refuses to leave the house because he does not want to pay for an apartment despite being rather wealthy. She doesn't want to rock the boat to get him out of the house because he becomes a dick in front of the children. 


* Any tips for making sure she gets a fair shake at her &amp; her sons future. 

* If you went though this any tips or things you wish you would have added to your divorce agreement. Anything you are very glad you had in your agreement.

He hasn't had much tv exposure.  He's watched 2 movie-length cartoons at home (Ponyo &amp; Blues Clues Musical).  My husband has tried to get him to watch CARS multiple times, without success (kid always loses interest within 10 minutes or so).  However, he's seen Ponyo at home probably 10 times at this point and he'll sit through that.

I'm probably overthinking this, but I worry that he'll just not want to sit through a movie and we'll be out the $$$ spent taking him and will have to walk him out early so we don't disrupt anyone else.  

Also - any thoughts on age appropriateness of the Secret World of Arrietty [G]?  I looked online and read the parent reviews and it seems tame enough, but there was a 7+ recommendation and I'm scratching my head as to why."	t5_2tb3h	True

The last FAQ Friday, seemed to go pretty well. If you haven't had a chance to see the results, you can see them in the  [FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/raisingkids/faq).

Here are the ""rules"" for FAQ Friday:

* Recommendations should be put in top level comments.
* 1 suggestion per comment.
* In your comment identify which age range it is for (if appropriate)
* Top 10 comments in each age range with at least a score of 2 will get copied into the FAQ
* Feel free to meta post (e.g. comments on how FAQ Friday is run, suggestions for future FAQ Fridays, etc.)
* If the top level post is just the name of a TV show, feel free to fill in some details in a reply for other readers and for the FAQ.  When I copy to the FAQ I try to summarize all the comments.

This is one post where you can ignore reddiquette and just vote up/down based upon whether you agree with the recommendation.

I will probably wait until Tuesday or so to give everyone a chance to post and vote.  I'll edit this post once the voting has 'closed'.

I love that the two year old 'M' loves to talk, sing and make all sorts of noises. It's great, when the twins are up with her. When the girls take their naps, the screaming and giggles wake them up over and over causing them to lose sleep.           
When I ask M to use an inside voice, talk quieter or explaining to her that babies are sleeping she doesn't seem to listen and will go ""Baby wake up now!""       
I can't move the babies or M to another room yet. Their mother and I agree that I need them downstairs so I can monitor their breathing (they were premies) so that's not an option. And the twins are pretty heavy sleepers, TV, vacuuming and normal noise doesn't wake them.          
  

Any methods or tips on how to work on this with her?
