1355450855.0	14tjeb	A friend posted this on Facebook and I thought I'd share	TheRedWizard	91	23	8	"""From time to time, people tell me, ""Lighten Up, It's just a horse."" or ... ""That's a lot of money for 'just a horse."" 

They don't understand the distance traveled, the time spent, or the cost involved for ""just a horse."" Some of my proudest moments have come about with ""just a horse."" Many hours have passed and my only company was ""just a horse,"" but I did not once feel slighted. 

Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by ""just a horse,"" and in those darkest days of darkness, the gentle touch of ""just a horse,"" gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.

If you, too, think it's ""just a horse,"" then you probably understand the phrases like: ""just a friend,"" ""just a sunrise,"" or ""just a promise."" ""Just a horse"" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. 

""Just a horse"" brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person. Because of ""just a horse"" I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future. 

So for me and folks like me, it's not ""just a horse"" but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment. ""Just a horse"" brings out what's good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself, and the worries of the day.

1367853049.0	1dsn99	Anyone else have problems with barn drama?	1_InABlueMoon	64	5	54	I've been leasing a horse at a barn ive been working at for about 6 months now. Its a free lease so i muck stalls to keep my board down two days a week. I take lessons from the barn owner, and i really like her as a trainer. She's really helped me advance, so i don't wanna leave this barn. However, since i am leasing, i do go a lot alone just to ride and work the horse. One of the boarders is a mother and daughter pair who have seemed to target me as someone to make constant fun of. Its really starting to effect my confidence, which is silly, but they are so persistent and i am the only person they speak to like this at the barn. When i go out on trail rides by myself, they will purposely choose the same trail as me and will catch up with me and comment constantly on my form and riding. They constantly talk negatively about the quality of my riding boots and tack. They even went as far as throwing out a bucket of my grooming tools saying they were cheap and worthless. Its gotten really offensive since i take pride in all my tack, and i definitely don't buy cheap tack. The mother even went to the old barn i rode at and asked the trainer about my skill levels when i rode there, and told the trainer that i am such a bad rider, i shouldn't be trusted to ride alone. I'm 18 and it seems really ridiculous to be attacked by a 50 and 22 year old. SO i was just wondering if there are others who've experienced this and how did you deal with it?	t5_2qlye	True

I've had Torah from almost two years now. She's about seven, turning eight this year. She was broken in at two years of age by having her muzzle tied to her chest. This led to her bucking anytime she felt downward pressure on the reins.

An old(ish) lady at the riding school I worked at bought her when she was still two and advertised as a beginner horse because pretty colours mean pretty horse to a lot of people. My boss straight away told her that Torah needed to go back out to the paddock to grow up.

When she was brought back in, she was out of control and the lady who bought her decided she was too much to handle. She was going to sell her to be used as some sort of rodeo horse type thing, but my boss felt sorry for Torah and bought her.

A year later, after bucking off many, many people and gaining a lot of enemies, a friend and I took her on as a lease horse. We fed her up, got her coat looking healthy and actually got her to the point where she enjoys being ridden and is generally a happy horse. So proud of her."	t5_2qlye	True

I'm just trotting around, doing some simple drills when he spooks at our neighbors house. He slightly rears, but since it's muddy, he loses his footing and starts to slip. He's super expressive so you could just see his face almost make a ""D:"" face when he then starts to slowly ""fall."" He basically laid down as I pretty much walked off his back and he finished with a dramatic show of laying his head on the ground in defeat. Whole thing probably took about 7-10 seconds and was so careful, slow, and dramatic. Got him back up and continued our drills, without any indecent the rest of the day. That Arab can be such a princess and the pea sometimes. Just thought I'd share. :) feel free to comment any Stories you have about over reactive equines!"	t5_2qlye	True
