Within that pool, people seem to have many different flavors of post processing. I had an idea, if the mods would agree, and if anyone else here would find it fun... A weekly challenge.

Heres the idea... Once a week, the mods could upload a pure RAW file, to a public dropbox account or something similar. (Maybe something that they have shot, or a file someone else could give them.) Then, anyone who wants to participate could download the file and process it to their abilities/liking. I'm sure we would see a vast range of post processing types and likings. 

Just a thought. I think it would be fun and with over 1,400 readers here, we are bound to get some awesome and unique results. "	t5_2wuh9	True

This is a new idea proposed by one of our subscribers and there are still things we need to work out such as how people will be able to submit raw files to us and what the official name of this challenge will be called. 

To get this started [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/112301329/IMG_1609.CR2) is the first Raw file provided by us. But in the future we would like to choose from images that you guys submit.

1372119429.0	1h06gx	Photoshop vs Lightroom: Any comment on my current post-process workflow is appreciated!	whyjesse	12	3	6	"Hello. I've been doing photo and graphic design separately for a while. However, since I have experience with photoshop, I've never bothered to look into lightroom for my post-production workflow. I don't know much about it, but what advantages does lightroom offer over photoshop?

My current photoshop version is CS2. My most common workflow includes, roughly in order of process:

* 1 passthrough of sharpening
* Cropping for improved composition (obvious)
* Choosing to b&amp;w (about 70% of my photos) or not
* Masking various areas depending on desired composition and effect
* Changing RGB curves based on mask. I will, for example, introduce contrast in a sky but not in other areas, or try to highlight certain areas in lighting
* Brightness/contrast
* Color: Hue/saturation first, then applying an exclusion fill layer or curves only in R/G/B 
* Do anything additional like noise for artistic effect, blurring, or highlight lens flares, etc.

How can I improve on this process? What additional advantages would lightroom give me?

Here's a sample of my [work](http://ijylage.tumblr.com/).

I have a couple of examples here:
A lizard [before](http://i.imgur.com/Ak80elE.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/yKLkIXV.jpg)

A forest pool [before](http://i.imgur.com/uMdI07W.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/aJyBX7n.jpg)
 
And an [album](http://imgur.com/a/yy60e) so you can get a more direct comparison.
 
For each photo I took it underexposed intentionally - cameras are much, much better at capturing details a little under properly exposed than a little over. The pool shot was much darker originally than I wanted, but the part I wanted in the reflection was overcast, so I stopped down so the harsh sunlight to the left didn't wash it out.
 
For editing, I used my usual Camera Raw workflow: set the lens adjustments (both shots were with a Nikon d3100 with kit lenses, the pool with the 18-55, the lizard with the 55-200) to wipe out the fairly severe vignetting, and then setting the white balance to cloudy for both (if I pick up my camera, cue clouds, always).
 
I then set exposure, both going a ways up, increasing blacks also. The pool needed a fair bit of fill light. This blew out the sunlight on the left, but we get there. Did some small sharpness increases on each.
 
That is my workflow for pretty much any photo, ends up taking me a few seconds now to make sure it all fits without clipping.
 
There the 2 diverge. On the lizard I increased the saturation and luminosity of the yellows, while darkening the reds and oranges. The contrast was jumped up, and I bumped the clarity a smidge. Only thing I did in Photoshop directly (as in not Camera Raw) was a slight burn on the eyes, and a dodge on that cool iris ring.
 
For the pool, I had to really wrestle with the contrast and brightness to get it looking ok without a big white smudge to the left. Managed it by selectively increasing the luminosity of the greens and blues, while dropping the reds and oranges.  I then decided to play around with split toning - the shadows went green, the highlights went blue. Didn't need any local adjustments, so I left Photoshop alone on this one.
