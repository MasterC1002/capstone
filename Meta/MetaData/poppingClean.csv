1366349481.0	1cnvk8	This is a story about how my mother popblocked me.	MechanicalPencils	356	36	34	"It also shows how sick we are.

So, both my mother and I are popping enthusiasts.  Like, we live for it basically.

The family next door to us when I was growing up had a grandma that lived with them.  Edna.  *shudder*  She was a horrid old bat.  She chain-smoked and snarled at us kids from her spot at the kitchen table, where she played solitaire and ate pork products all day long.  She was pretty much the most unpleasant woman, physically and verbally, that I have ever encountered.

Well, it just so happens that Edna had a blackhead on her left temple.  When I say ""blackhead"", I mean THE MOTHER OF ALL BLACKHEADS.  It taunted my mother and I for years.  Years!  It was ready to go the entire time...nice and raised, the kind that would just need a little squeeze and would pop right out in the most satisfying way, probably with a palmful of pus, leaving a nice empty hole behind.  This made being in her presence even more unpleasant, because it was torture to see this thing and not be able to get at it.  My mother and I talked about it all the time.

Well, one day Edna stood up from the kitchen table and fell right back over, dead as a doornail.  Her family was appropriately sad, but more concerned over funeral arrangements.  They didn't have much money and were not prepared to give her the funeral that the probably didn't deserve, but that they wanted for her.  My mother wanted to help, but seeing as how we were also poor, the only thing she could do was offer some sort of service.

In short, what the family ended up needing was someone to help prepare the body for the viewing.  My mother volunteered.  

""What?""  I asked.  ""What the hell do you know about cadaver makeovers, Mom?  Besides, that's kind of sick!""  

""Oh, it's no big deal.  I just have to do her hair, make her face look less dead, and remove any obvious blemishes,"" she replied.

Then it hit me.  She stood there smiling triumphantly and envy washed over me.  My mother volunteered for this job because she wanted that blackhead.  

And she got it.  It was apparently the pinnacle of satisfactory poppages.  She still rubs it in that she got what we both desperately wanted, and describes it in gleeful detail.  She popblocked me and I still harbor a lot of resentment."	t5_2s2wi	True

They just get large and juicy and eventually have to be cut to get all the oil out leaving small scars. 

I've had about 5 in a year and a half. 
They are extremely painful.
I've tried just leaving them alone and not touching them, but one that I left alone is still a small spot after about 6 months. I am assuming it is turning into a serbaceous cyst.



I read a thread yesterday, and somebody was praising *triple-antibiotic cream* for zits.

I just got over a whopper double pore massive one that I had to poke and is finally healing, and 3 days ago another one started.

It was big, juicy, painful, and no whitehead just like the others I get. 
I put the triple antibiotic cream on it. After an hour or so I started feeling random painful twinges inside of it.

I put more on it when I went to bed. I woke up this morning and it was still giving the painful twinges. I went to mirror and **OMFG** a fully developed white head.

I danced to my sewing kit for a fresh needle and cleaned it.

I barely pricked the head, and oil started running. I touched it a little and it started pouring out. I squeezed and *sploosh* gorefountain all over the mirror. Did this two or three times. Felt more in there and squeezed again and got a nice little seed out followed by a torrent of blood.

I am sitting here happily writing this, and it's still running a little bit.

Just wanted to say thanks /r/popping. You've made my day much brighter.

[The following 3 months of misery](http://imgur.com/a/Bxfuw#0)

[OP DELIVERS!!! The scar, taken today](http://imgur.com/a/GeqwV)

The surgery was about 2 and a half years ago. I had had the cyst for about 18 years (since I was about 17-18). It had always been more of a nuisance than painful. It wasn't until I was in the Navy and on shore duty that I was able to see a doctor and have it removed. I had been to a couple of doctors before but both of them said that since it wasn't causing me serious pain then they didn't want to to do surgery. My Naval doc said he had done many before and that it would not be a problem. After I woke up from surgery he told me that he had performed about 45-50 of these operations and this was BY FAR the largest cyst he had ever seen (as denoted by the amount of tissue that was removed). He said I had a lot of meat back there lol. he kept expecting to reach my tailbone but never did. The following 3 months i was on medical leave and bed rest. I did not leave my house for 2 and a half months straight. It included nearly 5 months of vacuum therapy. I was wearing the device on my hip even for the last month while I was at work....I earned the nickname ""Bubbles"" due to the slight gurgurling sound that the machine made and the blood bubbles going through the tube. the pictures we taken by my nurse that came 3 days a week to change the dressing. The first day of the dressing was probably the most painful experience of my life. They had to shove a foam sponge into the hole and seal it for the vacuum. It felt like they were stuffing a brillo pad into me. It was worse than when my gall bladder had to come out and I never thought anything could be worse than that.

If you look at your nose closely on a mirror - You're certain to see small little black spots - Must be blackheads!

Wrong. Those are [sebaceous filaments](https://customskinsolutions.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/the-truth-about-blackheads/) which are 100% normal and invisible to anybody who isn't putting their face to your nose. They're just your pores, and the more you pop 'em, the larger the holes become, and then they'll be visible, and irreversible.

You cannot get rid of them no matter what, no matter how hard you push - and they aren't blackheads, so stop calling them that. If you're unsure of the difference, consult these sites: [1](http://voices.yahoo.com/sebaceous-filaments-no-they-arent-blackheads-6387426.html?cat=69), [2](http://prettysmartonline.blogspot.ca/2012/11/sebaceous-filaments-versus.html). 

tl;dr - Blackheads are irregular, much larger and visible from a few feet, while these filaments are place in a regular pattern, are tiny and are invisible from a few feet. After you pop 'em, they'll reappear after a week or two, stronger than ever.

[Not blackheads, just sebaceous filaments](http://i.imgur.com/NOpMBy8.jpg)

[Sebaceous filaments are safe, stop taking them out :(](http://i.imgur.com/q0yWl.jpg)

1370376537.0	1fo96a	Pro Tip from your friendly neighborhood popper :)	DeaditeQueen	215	30	29	"Yes, I am the official ""popper"" for friends, family and even acquaintances. I live in WY and cysts, abscess, and plain old bad cases of acne are easily derived by many of the coal miners and ranchers out here. I have yet to post any of my own vids bc most of the ppl I help out are kinda embarrassed and I rather them keep coming back to me then stop lol

Ok, on to my tip. I always read lots of good advice and feedback on this sub but one tip has never come up (to my knowledge). This works for cysts and abscesses, and is excellent when they are deep or in a very tender area. There is a super easy paste that can be made with just 2 ingredients in your kitchen cabinets. Simply mix apple cider vinegar and baking soda together to form a thick paste. Yes, it MUST be apple cider vinegar, no substitutes! Apply the thick paste to the area, then cover with gauze and wrap with an Ace bandage (if possible). However you do it make sure the paste is properly covered and secured over the area. Leave on for at least 3 hours, but overnight is best. Yes, it STINKS.

Many times when your covering is removed your cyst/abscess not only is close to the surface, but occasionally the dried paste takes the ""cap"" off of it and it will start draining immediately. This technique helps avoid unnecessary deep cuts, or large cuts in tender areas. Obviously this paste should not be used near any mucous membranes (ladies). 

I've found this technique helps eliminate waiting for a cyst/abscess to rise closer to the surface. It does a week or two's worth of wait time, and discomfort overnight! I've NEVER had this mix fail. Happy popping!"	t5_2s2wi	True

1350365848.0	11k2ss	Story - popping a cyst on the penis	penilecyst	212	33	35	"I wish I had pics and or video, but this was over 10 years ago.

So, I'm 21.  I notice this bump just under the head of my penis, on the underside.

I think it's nothing, it's just a part of the natural evolution of my body.  It doesn't hurt, it's not sensitive, it's just... there.

I was in a college dorm room at the time, and my roommate made my usual... habits, a little restrictive since he was always there in the room.  

So, come Christmas vacation, and it's on like Donkey Kong.  Morning, afternoon, night, I'm getting my hands-on experience like I never have before. 

Then, that bump. It's huge, it's bright red. It looks like a zit, but... it's not.  I attempt the usual popping procedure, but just a little puss, nothing more is coming out.

And it's getting bigger, it looks infected.  I start to freak out.  What if it's a bigger problem?  What if they have to amputate?  I was a virgin, so it want's an STD (yes, I know, I was 21), so what if it was cancer or something?  God, I wished it was an STD.

I continue to squeeze over a few days.  Some liquid puss, some blood, nothing more.  Then I see it.  

It's like this white hardened thing, sticking out.    When I squeeze around the swollen area, it sticks out more.  When I leave it alone, it retreats.  

I run to my bathroom and grab some tweezers.  I squeeze real hard so that this white-headed beast polks it head out of huge red bump on my penis.

I grab it.  I've got it.  I pull. 

It's the size of an apple seed.  That thing was attached to my dick for months.  Freaked out, I fling it away.  To this day, I wish I had saved it.

The penis begins to heal over the next week, occasionally I squeeze some puss away which drains with ease.  And over 10 years later, it's fully healed, with only a little scar left to remind me of the fantastic self-surgery I performed on myself."	t5_2s2wi	True

I get way too much satisfaction out of this.  He had a solid cyst on his back last week, that occupied me for almost an hour.  And then another half the next night.  I didn't want to show him how much fun I was having, but it was the most interesting thing I'd done all month.

At first, it was a personal fascination that drew me in-- perhaps equal parts horror and hygiene. But there is so much more.

Popping videos are tone poems-- little moving testaments to the strange miracles of the human body. Each follows perfectly a classic Aristotelian story arc: protasis--&gt; epitasis--&gt; catastrophe.

And beyond the drama, there is intimacy. As families, friends and lovers gather together for the occasion of a pop, it's amazing to have a little glimpse into their lives with each other. It's part drunken Thanksgiving dinner and part primate grooming ritual. And it's beautiful.

I was wondering if /r/popping would like me to video these encounters.  This week alone we put a pin into a cat's leg and when we opened the leg, the biggest abscess started oozing, The stench was horrible and it took like 20 minutes to stop draining.  Yesterday, a Golden retriever came in with a huge abscess on its head and we lanced it.  It is so rewarding to see this and makes me get that ""feel.""   These are but a few and I think you guys/girls would love to see it also.  

Here's a picture of a tumor that we took off this week just for funsies(there was necrotizing tissue under it and it was draining): http://imgur.com/qBXpE

Edit: I talked to the vet. He said that he's afraid that it would be unethical to video these people's animals without their knowledge.  I need to get their approval with videoing it.  Therefore, It will be delayed for a while, but I will deliver.  "	t5_2s2wi	True

On to the story of disappointment and betrayal.

So I find a good one in the park this morning, but it hasn't quite come to a head.  I decide to leave it until the evening and spend the rest of the day in anticipation.

Mid afternoon, I pop out for some shopping.  Upon my return, the following harrowing conversation takes place:

Flatmate: Oh hey! I found a spot on your dog just now!

Me: Oh, really? (Please god don't have popped it, please god)

Flatmate: Yeah, so I gave it a little squeeze, and all this gunk shot out! It was a stream of stuff the length of my thumb! Pretty cool, eh?  I couldn't believe so much stuff would come out of such a little lump!

Me: Yeah... thanks...

I have OCD and a mild form of hirsutism, and the two don't get along very well.  I used to pick at the hair on my face until I had them all out, even if that meant that I had to dig gouges into my skin!  That is, until I found you.  I am fairly new here but already have noticed a huge difference in the amount I pick and how anxious I feel about it.  Although I still pluck/shave for cosmetic reasons I have mostly been able to control my darker impulses.  And for that I wish to thank you all.       P.S. I am aware of the hair pulling subreddit, but this is where I belong.	t5_2s2wi	True

I was in church.  One of my female friends was sitting next to me during service and whispers into my ear if she could pop my zit.

I had no idea I had a zit but he told me it was on my nose.  Of course I told her no.  So, I was just sitting there rubbing the bridge of my nose and I felt a release of pressure and a small spattering of pus in my hand.  I had no idea how bad it was so I got up and went to the bathroom.

In the bathroom, I started examining it.  I squeezed it some more and the money shot happened.  A stream of goo hit the mirror above the sink.

Ever since then.... I've been hooked."	t5_2s2wi	True

1369732501.0	1f6v18	My youtube channel, SmoothAberration, has received more than 2 violatations of 'shocking content' by youtube users and so the account has been locked. This is effectively the death of my channel.	SmoothAberration	148	30	50	"~~It is unclear where I can take this from here. The video that was today flagged as inappropriate was definitely NOT, in my opinion, one of my more shocking videos. Instead it was just a hair being pulled out from neck. Not even popping or pus! Because of the this, I cannot see a direction for my content that still includes youtube.~~

~~Youtube has shown that their review process of flagged videos is subject entirely to the whim of the youtube employee who views it.~~

~~Eg, a flagged video review could:~~

~~* Be reviewed by someone who is into 'popping' etc and just laugh, cancel that flagging action and go about his/her day.~~
* ~~Be absolutely horrified and remove my video and add another strike to my account~~

~~I am not even able to appeal this decision using the usual method because of the way they have limited my account, I cannot access that feature of my account settings any longer.~~

~~I may be able to upload videos to a new site, depending on their policies etc. In any case I am not particularly happy about this. Looking at vimeo and liveleak. Problem with vimeo is that there isn't really any kind of that content on the site, although their TOS and uploading guidelines don't explicitly prohibit it.~~

~~EDIT: IT seems I cannot appeal this decision because:~~

&gt;~~You may appeal each video strike only once. If we uphold our original decision on the strike, you will be unable to appeal future strikes on your account for a period of 60 days.~~

---

**EDIT: Effectively immediately the channel has been deleted (by me). The content may return in some form or another soon to youtube. I will have to think about some stuff while I am at work today. Fear not, I have a backup of all the old videos too..**

**Thank you for the support and even the emails. I will be resuming content uploads soon. I have been having problems with many videos being processed by vimeo and so I will be returning to youtube soon. The old content will be uploaded too, with some changes, but the changes should not worry most users too much.**"	t5_2s2wi	True

They will be returning to two new channels on youtube soon (+more!): GhostAberration and SmoothMedicine	SmoothAberration	161	46	17	"After the [recent problems with my account](http://www.reddit.com/r/popping/comments/1f6v18/my_youtube_channel_smoothaberration_has_received/), I have formed two new channels that will feature my videos on youtube:

* GhostAbberation: http://www.youtube.com/user/GhostAberration which will feature all my older videos (Ingrown hair 1 to 472) as well as the other older videos (eg, without Ingrown hair in their name)
* SmoothMedicine : http://www.youtube.com/user/SmoothMedicine which will have all-new unseen content, eg. videos after Ingrown hair 472.

For now, the vimeo channel will not be used.

I have also started a facebook page that will link content from both channels: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Smooth-Aberration/254354921373022

I have currently converted 20 of the videos and uploaded them to the Ghost channel. I am adding a warning title to every video in an attempt to scare away delicate individuals who want to report my videos because it offends them. 

I am currently converting videos 20 to 370 and they will be uploaded as soon as I get time. Unfortunately the automated renderer I'm using to add the warning title does each video frame-by-frame using only 1 core of my computers CPU...

Even before these problems, I was uploading 1-2 videos per day, almost every day. While doing this I had maintained a cache of ~100 videos to edit and upload, so you can rest assured that more new content will appear soon."	t5_2s2wi	True

1364975988.0	1bkr4x	I am a stylist, I have a confession...	Rubmybub	131	20	34	"I am a hairstylist of 13 years.  I often see zits, cysts and other anomalies on people's heads.  As ""one of us"" I find it very hard not to just go ahead and take care of a guys whitehead while trimming their neckline or further investigating a cyst while doing color.  But alas I cannot.  That would be weird.  I do let people know about anything big, miscolored, or just plain odd looking.  we dont always know whats going on with our own scalp and  I have even been able to warn several people about things that need to get looked at by a doctor.  One person came back and told me her dermatologist removed a pre cancerous spot she didnt even know about until i told her.  Today a client of mine (who has several large cysts) came to me and told me she was getting them removed in two days and would not be able to get her hair colored for several weeks because of the wounds.  Made me happy it was being taken care of but a little weird part of me silently said goodbye to these guys while coloring.  Seriously guys these things would rival some of the best on here.  Just wanted to get that off my chest..lol.  Maybe when Im too old to stand all day doing hair I will become an esthetician .  Yay extractions all day long!"	t5_2s2wi	True
