&gt;Dear Southwest Airlines: 
&gt; 
&gt;Southwest Airlines is currently a sponsor of this year's Presidential Debates. In the last week, other sponsors, including BBH, the YWCA, and Philips Electronics have withdrawn their support in recognition of the Committee on Presidential Debates' unfair exclusion of opposition parties. YWCA CEO Dara Richardson-Heron, M.D. wrote, ""As a nonpartisan organization dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all, we have decided to withdraw our sponsorship effective immediately."" 
&gt; 
&gt;Mark A. Stephenson, Head of Corporate Communications of Philips North America, wrote, ‚ÄúWhile the Commission on Presidential Debates is a non-partisan organization, their work may appear to support bi-partisan politics. We respect all points of view and, as a result, want to ensure that Philips doesn‚Äôt provide even the slightest appearance of supporting partisan politics.‚Äù 
&gt; 
&gt;Cronyism is hardly new to the two party duopoly. In fact, this duopoly has repeatedly bailed out Southwest‚Äôs competitors, who were unable to match Southwest‚Äôs more efficient business practices. 
&gt; 
&gt;Americans deserve a true presidential debate, not an artificially restricted one. We ask Southwest Airlines to join Philips, BBH, and the YWCA, and withdraw its sponsorship of the Presidential Debates."	t5_2rxc8	True

You are a valid option in the coming election and you are the most open and direct candidate. And we in r/GaryJohnson can only do so much to spread this news. Please do another AMA.

1351466459.0	128s55	We are running out of time, but here is what you can do for the final push. Please upvote for visibility.	OHhokie1	196	22	10	"Remember, this is about much more than just this election. This is about an idea, a movement, and about our future. I think we all realize the chances of us winning the election at this point are fairly slim...

HOWEVER, the chances of us having a huge impact on the election are actually HIGH. Our goal should be 5% nationally, which would give us FEC funding and automatic ballot access in many states for 2016. And to those of you who say ""Blah, blah, blah, Libertarians shouldn't be taking federal funding"". Perhaps not, but this isn't a anarcho-capitalist purity contest, this is about spreading a message and giving Americans a viable third choice that actually wants to reduce the state and its influence on our lives.

**Anyway, here is what you can do to put us over the top**:

* Make sure you give out any and all campaign materials you have. If you have the money/time to order more materials and give them out, please do so. If not, that's okay, but make sure bumper stickers and yard signs are not just sitting around on election day. Put them to good use.

* Go door to door and talk to your neighbors and/or hand out materials. Yes, no one likes to do this, but it's actually quite easy. I just got back from doing this in some off-campus college apartments. I hit roughly ~1000 apartments in a pretty short time period. 

* Make phone calls. If you have a neighborhood directory, start calling people and ask them to support Gary Johnson. There are other options for getting access to numbers for registered voters in your state. If you would like more info on how to make calls for Gary, send me a PM and I'll show you how.

* Make sure you go to the polls on election day. This sounds obvious, but your vote really does count and we need every last one. More importantly, if you have time, be sure to go to your polling place and hand out fliers and talk to voters as they walk in. If you have lots of resources already or can purchase them now, put out as many yard signs at your polling place as you can (laws here vary state to state, usually you can do this if you pick them up afterwards).

* If you are able to, please consider donating to Gary's campaign. IMO, the biggest impact you can have is to donate to the Ohio for Gary Johnson campaign directly here: https://www.wepay.com/donations/ohio-for-gary-johnson-advertising

The Ohio campaign is running a 5 star campaign (I was working on it this summer as well before I moved down to VA), and I'm really excited to see the results there, especially since it's a swing state. They have more FB likes than any other GJ state page, they have already purchased media and radio advertisements, and they have purchased billboards and a robocall campaign. Polling in OH has been as high as 10%, and is regularly around 4-5%. 

Thanks guys and keep up the good work!

- There is no contradiction between fiscal conservatism and social liberalism 

- A vast silent/unrepresented majority of Americans fit into that category

- He's not a cook libertarian, he's the middle of the road candidate, a true centrist

Other ways to put it:

""Most people I meet want the government out of their wallet and out of their bedroom.""

""I want a government that is fiscally responsible and neighbors who are personally responsible.""  

""I trust the American people to make the right decision when it comes to morality or personal choice, and I don't trust Congress to make a better decision than the individual taxpayer on how to spend their money.""  

tl/dr: Johnson should say he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal, in those words, while trying to avoid the label libertarian.

Gary Johnson's stance seems to match mostly what I want myself, but his site isn't showing the complete picture (unless I missed it somehow), such as how he feels about patent reform, etc.  Is there a better site which has all this info?

Also, why should one NOT consider GJ?  I don't want to see any attacks, just want honest responses indicating why an individual such as myself (very tech oriented, open minded, completely disappointed with the democrats, and even more so with the republicans) should not join the Libertarian party.

From Governor Gary Johnson 

December 21, 2012 
___
Friends,
 
Wow.  2012 has been quite a year, and as we wrap it up with the holiday season, I am once again overwhelmed with gratitude for all the great friends and supporters who joined together for the very important task of restoring liberty, economic freedom and smaller government to the nation‚Äôs dialogue.
 
We accomplished much, we built an amazing foundation for the future, and we began the process of showing America that things don‚Äôt have to be the way they are.
 
None of that would have happened without you, and I just want to take a moment to again say: Thank You!
 
As we gather with family and celebrate according to our respective traditions, please accept my deepest appreciation for your friendship --  and Best Wishes for a wonderful holiday.
 
My family and I are doing something a little out of the ordinary:  We are in South America heading out for what we hope will be a successful climb of Aconcogua, the highest mountain in the Americas and the fifth of the Seven Summits I am determined to reach.  As you know, achieving goals is important to me, and it is amazing to have my family joining me for such a great experience.
 
At the same time, we are very mindful that many Americans are not as fortunate this holiday season, especially those who have suffered unimaginable tragedy.  Our thoughts are with those who are enduring difficult times.
 
Making America better is the goal we all share, and I am excited about what we have planned for 2013.  I am returning to my role as Honorary Chairman of the Our America Initiative, and will be visiting  college campuses across the nation, taking our message to the media, and otherwise building on the great foundation we have built.  I look forward to having your continued support in all those important efforts.
 
Enjoy the Holidays, enjoy some time with friends and loved ones, and know that I value your friendship and support more than I can possibly express!

Best Wishes,
 
Governor Gary Johnson"	t5_2rxc8	True

Why is it that your views poll well with Americans but it doesn't translate to votes? Why is it, that literally millions of people who prefer you to Romney, won't vote for you if you are not a Republican, even if your views are exactly the same whichever party you're in?

You are playing a rigged game and you will never win. Imagine a baseball league, in which only two teams were allowed to have bats. Anyone else was allowed to play, but they could only use toothpicks to bat with. What would be more productive: for all these teams to band together and try and change the rules? Or for them to start practising batting with a toothpick?

There is a silver bullet to kill the government duopoly. It has existed outside of America for a long time, and it works. It's called ""Preferential voting"", ""Transferable voting"", ""Instant Run-Off Voting"". It means that people rank all candidates by preference, instead of picking just one. If their first preference doesn't win, and no one has won a majority yet, their vote is transferred to their next preference. 

For example, someone could vote: 1. Libertarian 2. Republican, which means ""If the Libertarian candidate doesn't win, transfer my vote to Republican"". Or Democrat, or whatever. The point is- you are no longer wasting your vote by voting third party. You will see a massive influx in votes, because, it's not that people don't support your views, it's just that no one wants to waste their vote on a party that cannot win.

I urge you to put aside your Presidential ambitions, join together with every third party - even the ones you disagree with - and work towards this ONE GOAL of fixing this rigged game. If you, Ron Paul, Ventura, Napolitano, Schiff, and people from other third party movements around the country were to start this conversation in America, I feel you canmake this a national conversation. The great thing about it is, in my experience, most people support the idea once they've heard about it. You don't have to win them over, you need only educate them.

Challenge the major parties: ""If Americans were allowed to vote by preference, do you think you could still beat me? Prove it in 2016""

I think you could win, if the game can be made fair. I have plenty of ideas and would love to help. I hope you'll read this, and I thank you for your time if you have.

He competed three times (1993, 1997, 1999) as celebrity invitee at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii, registering his best time for the 2.4-mile (3.9 km) swim, 112-mile (180 km) bike ride, and 26.2-mile (42.2 km) marathon run in 1999 with 10 hours, 39 minutes and 16 seconds.[100][101] He once ran 100 miles (160 km) in 30 consecutive hours in the Rocky Mountains.[16] On May 30, 2003, he reached the summit of Mount Everest[11] ""despite toes blackened with frostbite.""[25] He has also climbed three more of the Seven Summits: Mount Elbrus, Mount McKinley, and Mount Kilimanjaro‚Äîthe tallest peaks in Europe, North America, and Africa respectively.

Sure this is just a cursory analysis but it kind of flies in the face of the conventional wisdom here. Using the internet and word-of-mouth, could it be that the Libertarian Party actually ran the most efficient campaign, in terms of dollars and votes? "	t5_2rxc8	True

1340885382.0	vqjhp	Should Gov. Johnson speak at NORML conference in 2012?		74	4	11	"I ask this as a legitimate question, not merely a rhetorical one.  

However, my answer is an emphatic **yes**.  Remember that Johnson has [already been a keynote speaker at a NORML convention.](http://blog.norml.org/2011/02/02/ex-governor-gary-johnson-yes-it-is-time-for-pot-legalization-mr-president/)  So the association is already there.  Second, we know that marijuana legalization is favored by about 50% of the citizenry.  (See [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/wide-majority-of-colorada_n_1616058.html) and [here](http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/45091/americans-decry-war-on-drugs-support-legalizing-marijuana/) )  Finally, we know that Johnson has [admitted to smoking cannabis relatively recently](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/meet-gary-johnson-ron-paul-2012_520775.html) so he's the natural choice for Americans at the ""Cannabis smokers' lobby.""

Finally, I can anticipate the primary objection here:  Yes, herbert1820, but isn't NORML a 501(c)3 that isn't allowed to ""endorse"" political candidates in order to protect its tax status?

The answer is **yes**-- HOWEVER, all NORML would need to do is invite ALL 3 candidates (D, R, and L).  We can safely say that only Gov. Johnson is likely to accept.

So, does everyone else agree that Governor Gary Johnson should speak at the NORML national convention?

Do not let your Republican friends try to guilt you if Obama is re-elected. The country will survive him. The only way to grow the Libertarian Party is to consistently vote for it.
Right now the Republicans have plenty of political power they don't want to lose.

With no Democrat in the race, getting involved will make a difference and a possible win for our Party. Show David some love, like his facebook page, make a donation, etc. If you live in Arkansas, sign up to volunteer and get on the front lines. A win here would send a message across the nation that third parties can indeed win. More so it would rub dirt in the Republican's faces.

His opponent has voted to extend the Patriot Act, pass the NDAA,etc. I think if people in the area can get democrats on board to unseat a Republican in the general election, we can do very well.

As you're probably aware, Gov. Gary Johnson is dedicated to keeping the Internet free. He is strongly against bills that would weaken our freedoms online, such as [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) and [NDAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act).

Therefore, this week's hashtag is **#KeepTheWebFree**. We ask that you try to reference @GovGaryJohnson in your tweet if possible.

* For example: ""I'm voting for @GovGaryJohnson because he is the only presidential candidate who will #KeepTheWebFree.""

* For example: ""Congress has no right to limit my free speech online. @GovGaryJohnson will #KeepTheWebFree.""

* For example: ""I'm against SOPA and NDAA, but I'm for @GovGaryJohnson. #KeepTheWebFree.""

The campaign will also release a **new video** tomorrow right before the Twitter bomb, titled **""Protect Internet Freedom.""** Keep an eye out for Gary Johnson's Twitter account, and share the video far and wide!

Internet freedom is an issue that has a lot of universal appeal - one which both Republicans, Democrats, and Libertarians can agree on. This has the potential to be our biggest Twitter bomb yet!"	t5_2rxc8	True

Yesterday evening I decided to go out and talk to some people about Gary Johnson, I didn't talk to many (probably around 20, going door to door) and I was absolutely amazed at the feedback I had gotten.  First of all, not one person had heard of Gary Johnson, and none of them except for 1 had even heard of the Libertarian Party.  The people I talked to were a mix of older people and younger people but every single one of them was very much interested in Gary Johnson, so much to the extent that almost every single one on the spot had told me that he is who they would be voting for, especially if Mitt does get the nomination in August.  The thing that I also found that every single person had said was that they had no idea that there was any other options but they loved the idea of it and that they would definitely be voting Libertarian this Fall.

Lets get out there and just go door to door locally, start making phone calls, do whatever you're able to do, even if it's only talking about it to friends on Facebook.  But I have a feeling that Gary Johnson will make a huge impact this fall but it won't get there without our participation so lets get things rolling!

Thanks for reading.

I pressed 4 several times and it just repeated the question.  After that it just said ""you have made an invalid entry"" and hung up.  

I recorded it.. because I've come across this sort of thing many times over the years.  The polling outfits are controlled by supporters of the two parties (that's who pays their bills) so it's not uncommon for the polls to exclude the third party candidates.  

It would make an eye opening national TV ad..  ""Hey, you want to know why the polls say only 5% of the people support third parties?  Listen to this"".  

[here's the audio](http://www.4shared.com/mp3/45iQVCu0/Voice_002_1_.html).. but I had to cut off the end where it looped another time and then said ""you have made an invalid entry"" because I was talking and laughing over it.

About a month ago I saw some old buddies from college and late in the night we got on the topic of politics. Both of them immediately went into how Obama is messing up the country and we have to vote for Romney.

Knowing that they are both very liberal socially, I brought up Gary Johnson and asked them why they wouldn't vote for someone who clearly represents their point of view better than the major candidates. They both gave me the ""dude I'm not going to waste my vote, sometimes you have to vote for the lesser of two evils"" line. I tried to open them up a little more and I got no where. So I let it go.

I hadn't talked to him about GJ at all until this past weekend when he brought it up out of nowhere and said he voted (absentee) for Gary Johnson. I was stunned. It is amazing what kind of change you can create when you plant a new possibility into someones head.

January 3, 2013

**Friends,**
 
2013 is here ‚Äì and it will be a truly pivotal year for America.
 
When the dust settled after the election a few weeks ago, it was clear that the net result of the most expensive campaign in history was a continuation of the status quo. 
 
This week President Obama and Congress managed ‚Äì unbelievably ‚Äì to ‚Äúavert‚Äù the so-called Fiscal Cliff by **1) increasing taxes, 2) increasing spending, and 3) adding to a $16 Trillion debt that  simply cannot be sustained.**  Did we need any more proof that  the entrenched special interests and big government addicts are still very much in charge?
 
We can either shake our heads and complain‚Ä¶or we can do something to dislodge the entrenched system that is taking us over a **REAL fiscal cliff** ‚Äì not a temporary one concocted and then avoided by the politicians.  And we can either sit back and let the ever-growing government charge ahead with its plans to rob us of more and more of our personal and economic liberties‚Ä¶or we can stand up and say ‚Äúenough‚Äù.
 
Having received more votes than any Libertarian candidate for President in history, Governor Gary Johnson has proven that he can make himself heard on the national stage.  Thanks to thousands of supporters like you, we have built an organization that can have a REAL impact on the process. 
 
Seeing what is happening in Washington, Governor Johnson has no plans to sit back and let the big government machine keep rolling unhindered.  Millions of Americans share our view that government spends too much because it does too much.  Millions see the hypocrisy in both ‚Äúmajor‚Äù parties as they talk about reducing debt while in reality increasing it, and as they pay public homage to liberty while taking it away at every opportunity. 
 
Those millions of Americans need a voice, and in the weeks and months ahead, Governor Johnson will be stepping up to the microphone.  He has returned to his role as Honorary Chairman of the [Our America Initiative](http://ouramericainitiative.com/), and will be taking the message of liberty, small government and greater freedom to college campuses across the nation, to the national news media, and to audiences of every political stripe.  Stay tuned for exciting plans and developments to come!
 
Together, we have created a movement for liberty and fiscal sanity that is ready to pose a very real challenge to the status quo.  Your support and work have brought us a very long way ‚Äì and Governor Johnson appreciates everything you have done, and will do, as we go forward.
 
2013 is going to be an exciting, and critical , year.  In a few short weeks, the politicians will be trying to find a way around the nation‚Äôs debt limit.  Legislation impacting Internet freedom, civil liberties, privacy and foreign aid will be on Congress‚Äô agenda very quickly. 
 
We plan to be at the table as these decisions are made ‚Äì and Governor Johnson wants and needs your help.
 
Liberty is too important for us to sit on the sidelines as the politicians destroy it. 
 
Your friendship and support are, as always, deeply appreciated.
 
**Thank you,**

Ronald Nielson

Senior Advisor

Governor Gary Johnson
 
 
 
**P.S.  We have a lot of activities and efforts planned for the months ahead to spread Governor Johnson‚Äôs message. Your contribution at [Gary Johnson 2012](https://donate.garyjohnson2012.com/) will help make them happen!**

ALERT: GARY JOHNSON SUPPORTERS
Volunteers Needed In Philadelphia August 20-24, 2012
 
On August 1, 2012, the Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania submitted nearly 50,000 petition signatures to get Gary Johnson and Judge Gray on the ballot in Pennsylvania. Only 20,601 signatures were required so we qualified for ballot access and as of now Gary Johnson will be on the ballot. However, on August 8, 2012, our petitions were challenged by those we believe are associated with the Republican Party, who fear Gary Johnson will draw votes away from Mitt Romney this November.
 
In the first stage of this challenge, there is an allegation that 26,000 petition signers were not registered to vote. While there are no grounds for this statement, the Court has ordered the Libertarian Party to supply a minimum of 20 individuals each day commencing Monday, August 20, 2012 from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to check all 26,000 signatures at the Board of Elections to verify whether they are registered voters. If we don‚Äôt have those volunteers, we cannot defend this challenge and Gary Johnson will not be on the ballot in Pennsylvania.
 
The Commonwealth Court Order reads (in part) as follows:
 
The review [of more than 26,000 signatures] will take place at the Philadelphia Board of Elections, 520 N. Delaware Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19123-4295 and shall be conducted under the supervision of Court personnel with the assistance of City of Philadelphia election employees, with the objective of stipulating to the validity or invalidity of these signatures.  Review of challenged signatures will begin on August 20, 2012, at 8:30 a.m‚Ä¶ Each party shall have present 20 individuals‚Ä¶who are capable of performing computer searches utilizing the SURE system.  City of Philadelphia election employees will instruct these individuals on how to conduct searches on the SURE system.  The signature review will continue between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday until further order of the Court‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
I call upon all who can make it to Philadelphia the week of August 20-24, 2012 to volunteer to help. I will be there all five (5) days. It would be very helpful if volunteers can participate for multiple days, but even one day will be highly appreciated.
 
The Volunteer Coordinator for this effort is Roy Minet.  He can be contacted at 717-898-6142 (any time of the day or night) or at roy.minet@comcast.net.  He will provide you with more details about how to get to the Philadelphia Board of Elections at 520 N. Delaware Avenue and with respect to parking and lodging issues. Please contact anyone else who may be able to help.
 
This is an opportunity for you to obtain valuable political experience while at the same time doing something important to help keep Gary Johnson on the ballot in Pennsylvania.
 
If you have any general questions about the current ballot access crisis or about the Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania, do not hesitate to contact me personally.
 
In Liberty,

Relevant from Reddit:
     
&gt;There are two types of links, ""targeted"" and ""untargeted"" links.

&gt;When you submit an ""untargeted"" ad, your ad will run on the front page. You tell us when you want it to run, and how much you want to pay in total over that time period. When that date arrives, we take everyone with a link running on that day and figure out what the total contribution is of all of those bids. This total becomes the cost for that day of selling out our ad space. Each user gets impressions that commensurate with the fraction of the total that they contributed (so, say, you paid $20 and the total for the day is $200, you will get 10% of the site traffic). In this way, everyone pays the same CPM, though that CPM is variable from one day to the next.

&gt;When you submit a ""targeted"" link, you get two things:

&gt;1) Top spot on the subreddit being targeted. If there is more than one person (or more than one link) targeted to that subreddit on the same day, we use the same scheme as above to divvy up impressions.

&gt;2) When a user who subscribes to that targeted reddit comes to the front page, we will show your ad in competition with the other untargeted links. To make up for the fact that smaller reddits have fewer subscribers, we will weight your ad by ratio of its traffic to one of the top subreddits. For example, if the subreddit you are targeting gets 1/5 as much traffic as the top (default) subreddits, your ad will get a 5x boost when presented to users who subscribe to that subreddit.
      
So, that being said, I say we buy targetted ads for /r/politics, /r/AskReddit, /r/obama, and /r/romney /r/guns /r/frugal, /r/technology etc + a chuck going towards ""unspecified.""  The totals seem low enough that whatever we happen to raise on a given date, it will be enough to have serious impressions.  We might co-ordinate this with another AMA from Gary Johnson, specifically so he can answer tough questions to make Obama look like a typical politician.  It'll probably be big enough to get lots of coverage from HuffPo, etc which will carry over onto CNN at least.
      
I know reddit just posted something about fundraisers, do you think that'd be appropriate for this?

1342413007.0	wmlz9	"""Socially tolerant, fiscally responsible"" is a better slogan for the GJ campaign. Do you agree?"	FlexNastyBIG	67	11	11	"I think that ""socially tolerant, fiscally responsible"" would be a better slogan for the Johnson campaign than the current ones (""live free"", you are libertarian"", ""the people's president"").  My reasoning is that it instantly communicates a *lot* about Johnson's positions, and potentially has very broad appeal.  (who doesn't want to be both tolerant and responsible?)  Every time he started a media appearance, the interviewer would already have a good idea where he stands.

My impression of the current slogans is that they are too narrowly focused on hardcore libertarians - people who fly Gadsden flags.  There just aren't enough of us.  Gary needs to appeal to the general public as well, and I think ""socially tolerant, fiscally responsible"" would go a long way to help.

No Libertarian candidate--even Ron Paul in '88--has ever attained more than 1 million votes.  This is the historical record.

Back when he was a Republican, Gary Johnson was the first serious candidate to announce that he would compete in the first-in-the-nation NH primary.  Despite his early start and his background as a popular former Gov., Johnson never got any traction.

So I propose this:  **Johnson's campaign should begin by making a legitimate effort to win in New Mexico.**  Since he has already won the state of New Mexico, he knows how to do it.  If the Presidential election is close enough, New Mexico can make a difference.  Even if New Mexico won't tip the election, as is most likely the case, Johnson waging a strong campaign in this state is a proof-of-concept:  libertarianism can be popular stance to an electorate that is bigger than a municipality.

Even if Johnson can't win the state, Gov. Johnson has a better than 50/50 shot of being *the deciding factor* in the race for New Mexico.

In addition to New Mexico, I would propose that Johnson expands candidacy to two-to-four other states:  Vermont, New Hampshire, and possibly Maine and Rhode Island.

Why did I pick these states in New England?  These states have a combination of attributes that are conducive to Johnson getting a foothold:  a native culture of liberty (esp. NH), cheap media markets (esp. VT and ME), and extremely small geographic area for excellent retail campaigning (esp. RI).

The bottom line is that we shouldn't spread ourselves too thin.   

That is a recipe for over-promising and under-delivering.  That will only lead to *another* generation of disappointed and demoralized libertarian activists who are burnt out on electoral politics.  Promoting liberty requires just the opposite:  activists who combine passion with perspective; a willingness to serve in government with the determination to do the nitty-gritty to win elections.

1342515103.0	woz1b	We should court Democrats/Liberals to get Johnson up to 15%.	londubhawc	50	4	19	"So, a lot of people have been focusing on how to win the Paul vote lately.  And that's totally a worthwhile endeavor, Paul supporters are already adherents of The Message, and are pretty good at the grassroots thing.  But there's another section of the population I believe we should be courting just as much: Democrats.

Republicans have been saying, ""but aren't you just going to ensure that Romney loses/Obama wins?"" as though it were some nightmare scenario to have anyone other than Mitt in the oval office.  But here's the fun thing: that Republican nightmare is the average Democrat's dream. So, I suggest we turn ""A vote for Johnson is a vote for Obama"" to our advantage.  I say we *embrace* that.  When Johnson was presented as an alternative to Obama/Romney, it moved Obama's lead from 2.8%, a statistical dead heat, (95% confidence of the true value being between 6.1% ahead to 0.5% *behind*) to 5.6% (95% c.i.: 2.3% ahead to 8.9% ahead).  That means if the Democrats really prefer their man win the oval office back, it's looks like it's in their best interest to make sure Gary is included in Polls and Debates, to widen Obama's lead.

The trick is that while that's the *initial* effect, and will likely continue to be until he's well over the 15% debate qualification threshold, that's not the only effect of including Johnson.  I honestly believe that Johnson can win if he makes it to the debate table.

Most of us already know that there are plenty of Republicans who aren't happy with Romney (I have several in my family), but Obama has also having some problems with his base lately.  When West Virginia had their Democratic Primary, ~40% of them voted for a [federal inmate over Obama](http://swampland.time.com/2012/05/09/this-man-cant-vote-in-west-virginia-but-lots-of-people-voted-for-him/).  To me, that means that almost half of Democrats (at least in WV) want an option other than Mr Obama, but still don't want a Republican.  Some of them may be unhappy with his social policies (Civil liberties, wars, etc), while others may be concerned about more fiscal matters (blue dog democrats).  These are the people Johnson would pick up, because he can best Obama on both of those fronts.

**tl;dr:** We should play up the ""Johnson's inclusion ensures an Obama victory"" card with Democrats, so that when he is included in the debates (with their help), Gary can win them (and dissatisfied Republicans) over, and win the Presidency."	t5_2rxc8	True

ScientistPresent	60	14	113	"I was one of those 1% of the people who went out and voted for Gary Johnson, so trust me when I say that I believe in the cause for a third party politician. However Ross Perot, which is undeniably the most popular of any third party politician in our generation, received 0 electoral votes and a whopping 14% of the popular vote. Ross Perot was allowed in the debates, he was allowed to speak, and had enough of his own money to make commercials for himself, but people still felt it was a ""wasted vote"". I've heard that if he never pulled out of the race temporarily that he might have done a lot better, but he did, and saw a large decrease in the numbers. So my question is what makes you all still so hopeful that Gary Johnson can do it? This was his chance to make a name for himself and show the legitimacy of his campaign and he ended up with 1% of the vote not even winning his home state. After that I don't think he's going to get much more momentum especially if he doesn't receive any additional air time. Now i'm all for voting for what you believe in, and I hate this notion of a ""wasted vote"", but America as a collective for some odd reason is too afraid of wasting their votes. It's like whatever he says loses credibility because he's a third party candidate, and even if he did do good in some states he would be considered a ""spoiler"" which is outrageous. Anyways that's just my two cents, I don't have a real question, just a long rant.

The third line of attack is a rolling call schedule for State Directors to use in conjunction with the
Protest being Held at CNN. We will bombard their phone lines with requests to include Gary
Johnson in their polling.

Generally, states are paired up to work together for 30 minute intervals EVERY DAY until we
get what we are after.
We need as many people as possible to help with calling especially if they are unable to actually
attend the CNN Protest itself.

The Rolling Call Schedule starts on MONDAY JULY 16th and continues until we win!
The calls should begin as a wave going from the East coast to the West coast producing a
steady stream for at least 12 hrs each day.

CNN CALL NUMBER (404) 827-1500

STAY ON LINE UNTIL YOU CAN TALK TO THE OPERATOR.
ASK TO SPEAK TO WHOMEVER IS IN CHARGE OF POLLING THE PRESIDENTIAL
RACE.
THEN ASK WHOEVER YOU CAN GET ON THE LINE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

""I would like for CNN to include Libertarian Nominee Governor Gary Johnson in their
polling for the general election because he represents my views on many subjects, ________
being one of them. Will you please begin including him in your polling?""

***************************************************

Our final attack will show our defiance of the hand-picked big government candidates! In
combination with the protest and a twitter bomb, we are hosting a fundraising event to help
Governor Johnson and Judge Gray during this protest.

http://fundly.com/blackoutcnn

Every dollar counts, and is a huge assistance for the campaign. Let us come together either in
person at the event or on Twitter, but as well let us come together and donate $10, $25, or $50
towards the campaign and the efforts to be included in National media and the debates!

Every dollar we raise shows the media and the two-party establishment that we are fed up with
the ‚Äúchoices‚Äù they force upon us.

Granted, it would be better if Obama and Romney were there, but who needs them? Live stream it, post it on YouTube, then have as many people as possible share it on Reddit, Facebook, and so on. Surely it would give everyone at least *some* more exposure?

Along with Nebraska, it's one of the two states that apportions its electoral votes instead of winner-take-all. In 1992, Maine voted in larger numbers for Perot, the third party candidate, than H.W. Bush. In its gubernatorial elections, 2 independent candidates ran along with the usual crowd, taking over 40% of the vote combined. Not to mention that Maine is the state where given a choice between all candidates, voted for Ron Paul in the highest numbers during the Republican Primaries. In fact, not only did Ron Paul win Maine on a vote-by-vote basis (of course Waldo county just couldn't handle the inch of snow, as anyone in Maine can probably tell you - is bullshit) he got 21/24 delegates.

About a year ago, I became aware of a website [EpicStep.com](www.epicstep.com), which is a website that you can design a billboard and have others donate toward it being displayed in the city of your choice. The campaign I donated towards was awareness towards Wikileaks, but why not Gary Johnson?

We can all band together to raise the funds, design the billboard (we all can contribute designs and vote for the best) and promote the message of liberty and Gary Johnson!

So first thing is first. Are you willing to donate a few dollars towards this campaign if I get it started? And second, where should this billboard of ours be? The Wikileaks billboard that was in Las Angeles cost $4,300.

Let me know what you think!

EDIT: Sounds like we have some interest! The top locations I've heard so far are Florida, New Mexico, and Alaska. Once I hear from a few others (someone, as someone suggested, I contact the campaign) so that we have a clear majority about the location, I'll go ahead and start the campaign and report back here.

EDIT #2: So JoshRawdon (co-director in the State of Ohio for the Johnson campaign) has been kind enough to contact the campaign for us to be check for input from them. As soon as we hear from them and everything is sorted out, I'll start the campaign as it seems we have plenty of support here."	t5_2rxc8	True

They did not schedule the event with /r/IAmA moderators, they didn't include sufficient proof, they formatted the post incredibly bad and titled it ""Governor Gary Johnson's Reddit.""

What the hell is this shit?  They also didn't even post the event on G+ or Facebook until a few hours before the AMA even happened.  This just makes Gary look extremely incompetent and needs to be addressed.

The big issue here is that it just tells you to go ""reddit.com"" at 7pm PT. Anyone that doesn't know reddit will be a little confused when they don't see anything about Gary Johnson on the home page at 7pm. Even if you do know how reddit works, you might be confused. A link to /r/IAmA would be more appropriate along with a note to look for Gary's post.

Second issue is he has to add some focus to these AMA's. Tell us why you are doing these AMA's and if there is any specific topics you would like to discuss for this AMA.

If Gary or his people would hold a 30min AMA here in /r/GaryJohnson, they could improve their execution of AMA's ten-fold.

(xpost politics)"	Terra55	38	5	3	"*I'm a big supporter of third parties, and I made this post on politics* ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12kpjq/make_a_real_difference_voting_how_to_vote_third/ )
    
    
    
Are you a reluctant Obama voter?  Or a reluctant Romney voter?  Are you voting ""against"" a candidate almost as much as for a candidate?  Are you confused as to why abortion and gay marriage should decide (or be decided by) your views on economic policy?  Do you feel that neither party really represents what's important to you?  Tired of the broken politics of two factions who hate each other?    
    
If you are sick of the two party system, but worried about ""wasting"" your vote, here's what you should do this year...    
    
**1.  Identify which of the two major candidates you are reluctantly voting for (or which candidate you are voting against).    
2.  Find somebody you trust who ""supports"" the other candidate, and plans on voting.    
3.  Make an agreement that you will BOTH vote third party.       
(Optional step 4)  Both of you agree to go find two OTHER people to make the same deal, turning it into sort of a positive pyramid scheme.**
    
Since your original votes would have canceled each other out, you can now both safely vote third party without affecting the winner of the election.  In fact since your votes would have cancelled each other out, it would be wasting your vote to NOT do this plan (unless you love the two party system and hate the idea of more choices).  The two of you weren't going to make any difference at all with your original votes, but now you can vote for something meaningful.    
    
(How much you ""trust"" the other person should probably depend if you live in a swing state or not.  If you live in a narrow swing state, it should be a sibling, spouse, parent, best friend, whatever.  If you live in a landslide state, you should be safe finding strangers on reddit to make a voting pact with.)    
    
No third party candidate is actually going to win this election, but 5% of the vote is the cutoff for a significant chunk of Federal Campaign money for next election, and would be a huge momentum builder ( http://ivn.us/2012/11/01/why-5-matters-to-gary-johnson/ ).    
    
In the long run, we need to replace our current ""first past the post"" voting system (which almost guarantees a two party system) with something better, like score voting.  But it's hard to build momentum for election reform when the public perception is that there are only ever two candidates.  If we can get 5% for Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green), that would be a big help in building a future where we have more choices.  
    
Even if you really love Obama or Romney, you should do this anyways.  Your cancelled out votes wouldn't have affected the election anyways.  And even if you aren't thrilled with Johnson or Stein, they aren't going to win this election and actually become president this year anyways, and you can still support the idea of having choices.    
    
Anyways, please tell your friends, come up with a twitter hashtag or whatever, and spread the word.  I know the election is only a few days away, but the two party system is really terrible, and this is a way to make a difference."	t5_2rxc8	True

I really just need to get something off my chest.

If we are honest with ourselves, our votes as individuals do not affect the ultimate outcome of an election. It is therefore ludicrous to claim that voting for someone besides your favorite candidate somehow hurts your second or third choice; you are not that important.

Voting is about political expression, nothing more, nothing less. And to say anything less than what you truly believe is to betray your duty as a citizen.

But there are quite a few states that are pretty decidedly one party or the other at this point ([here's an up-to-date electoral map](http://electoral-vote.com/)), where voting for a third-party candidate won't change the election results, but WILL send a strong message.

If Johnson is going to get anywhere in November, step 1 is getting him on the national debates. To do this, the only thing he still needs is 15% in the polls.

What's one way we can get there? Convince your friends that agree with Gary Johnson on the issues and live in decided electoral states to vote and poll for him!

**Obligatory donation push**: if you haven't yet, please contribute to the Gary Johnson [money bomb](http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/) to get him into the national debates!

Now needless to say be it Ron Paul or Gary Johnson winning will be unbelievable difficult and brutal. 
I think if Gary could put the Paul supporters to work with an endorsement from Paul he could have a chance. One thing Paul supporters have in spades is heart and willingness to go the extra mile, such as myself. I only planned to stay after the straw poll in iowa and elect others as delegates, I never expected become a precinct delegate, then all the way up to state and on the central committee for *****. I would be willing if Ron Paul was not the nominee to do whatever it takes to get Johnson a win in Iowa. I am not alone.
Before any of that it sounds like Johnson needs 15% in some poll to get on debates. If he could get to 15% and got to debate he would stand a real strong chance of getting much bigger poll numbers. Wouldn't be shocked if it doubled almost.

I think Johnsons chances will rely on 2 things.
Ron Paul supporters ( sorry if that sounds cocky or anything but I believe it. )
Boosting poll numbers as fast as possible. (Through grassroots movements. )

Actually Ron Paul sort of appealed to Occupy, though Occupy as a whole would never endorse someone their supporters could like Johnson a lot more than Paul.

1336396789.0	tb48w	Hello /r/GaryJohnson, I would like to join your ranks	OHhokie1	37	3	7	"I've worked for Paul's campaign in a couple of state's and I slightly prefer him to Johnson on a few issues, but I'm excited about Johnson's recent nomination by the LP. I also do not believe Paul will come out of the GOP convention with the nomination, and I hope the liberty movement consolidates behind Johnson. I have a lot of friends in the Libertarian Party, and I would really like to see Johnson lift the party up to be a more formidable political force. 

I am a moderator over at /r/R3VOLUTION, a subreddit dedicated to grassroots political action for pro-liberty candidates. I made a post earlier this morning about Gary: http://www.reddit.com/r/R3VOLUTION/comments/tb112/gary_johnson/

Does anyone here have direct contact with the campaign? I know Gary has done an AMA on reddit before, and usually with /r/R3VOLUTION we like to bring candidates on to do a more intimate AMA with people interested in donating or volunteering for that candidate. It would be awesome if we could get Gary to come hang out with us for an hour. I'm going to ask the community if we can make Gary the ""Candidate of the Week"" (which we've been slacking on recently), and it would help if we could get him to do another AMA.

Anyway, I know some of Gary's campaign workers and officials in VA where I go to school, but if anyone here is involved with the campaign and from VA or especially Ohio (where I'll be this summer) I'd love to hear more about opportunities to volunteer. 

Last thing: Where can I get cool Gary Johnson gear? All the stuff on his website was kind of lame... :("	t5_2rxc8	True

1333947921.0	s0d7n	Hi, Ron Paul supporter here	n3rdy	42	10	52	"Just wanted to give some friendly advice from the perspective of a Ron Paul supporter.

Most of us are supporting the principles and ideas that Ron Paul advocates, it's not about the man, its about the idea.

Where I see many of you (including GJ himself) going wrong is, your angle is ""Hey guys, let's get serious. Ron Paul doesn't stand a chance."" and it doesn't come off any less condescending from a Libertarian as it does from a Republican or Democrat. We hear that enough from everyone else, don't try to look like everyone else.

I'm about 95% positive that Ron Paul will endorse Gary Johnson if his delegate strategy doesn't pan out. Many many of us are already considering Gary Johnson, most of your work is done for you on converting us. Even with you sometimes coming off as condescending, because we are supporting freedom and liberty, not a politician, not a person.

For the die hard Ron Paul supporters who plan on writing him in or not voting, I don't see it being a difficult thing to convince them that voting Gary Johnson will be taking an even bigger stand. You will need to convince them that their fight is not with the mainstream media, but with tyranny itself. Writing in a candidate may help them vent their frustration about corrupted MSM, but it's counterproductive to the big picture.

Inevitably there are also people who would want to write in Ron Paul just because he's Ron Paul and they are so emotionally vested in him that they feel like they are betraying him by voting for someone else. For these people you will need to show them that they are not betraying Ron Paul and that it's a bigger compliment to vote the way he would, than to vote with their emotion.

All that said, we're still not convinced that all is lost. Stranger things have happened. If Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination, I know I will personally be doubling my efforts to get votes for Gary Johnson.

Perhaps it would serve all of us best if we promoted both Ron Paul and Gary Johnson concurrently. The only hitch would be if Ron Paul did get the nomination, he would be running against Gary Johnson. It shouldn't be too hard to make lemonade out of that though."	t5_2rxc8	True

I'm just genuinely curious as to who here doesn't consider themselves a libertarian, but is a supporter of Johnson's candidacy.

I consider myself to be liberal-leaning. I'm a registered Democrat. I support same-sex marriage. I oppose violent intervention abroad. And I believe that the federal government can do certain things more efficiently than the states.

I know that Democrats are the ones who are labeled ""big government"" but growing up in a fairly liberal town, I was raised to believe the Republicans were for ""big government"". More wars, invading women's medical privacy, allowing the government to dictate who can marry (and having marriage a government institution in the first place), increasing the defense budget, etc. etc. As a result, it surprises me when I hear that most supporters of Johnson are registered Republicans, because it sounds like he could definitely sway more Obama voters than Romney voters.

As a liberal, I like Johnson because:

* **He's pragmatic.** Regardless of what you believe the role of government should be, you must admit that any government policy must be economically efficient. There's no point in having a government program if it ends up harming more people than it helps. Johnson mentioned the ""cost/benefit"" analysis of his governing philosophy at the debate last night and that really resonated with me.

* **He's not Ron Paul.** Ron Paul was borderline extremist - both politically and religiously. I admired Paul's respect to the constitution, but I couldn't respect his stances on medical privacy, Christianity, or his stubborn steadfastness to the gold standard. He was borderline isolationist. Ron Paul is what turned me off to Libertarianism.

* **He's not Barack Obama.** Obama has been anything but Progressive. This guy has deported more undocumented workers than any other president. He's fought pathetically on Guantanamo. And he's done nothing to fix our national debt. (I'm keeping it brief, I could go on.)

* **Johnson is pro-gay marriage, pro-choice, pro-immigration reform, pro-drug legalization, against the NDAA and against American imperialism.** These are issues that *should* be bipartisan, but aren't because American media has become excellent at dividing us over trivial issues.

So I ask again, are there any other non-Libertarians here? If so, how do you usually vote? Where are you from and what party are you registered to? Why do you support Johnson over other candidates?"	t5_2rxc8	True

Sample e-mail:

**Subject**: Please cease your support for the Commission on Presidential Debates

**Body**

&gt;Hello,

&gt;My name is _______. You may not be aware of this, but you support an undemocratic group, the Commission on Presidential Debates.

&gt;In spite of being on the ballot in 47 states and litigating in 3, more than enough to win the presidency, Gary Johnson has been excluded by the CPD from participating in the Presidential debates.

&gt;Not only is excluding candidates that could win the Presidency undemocratic, because the CPD is a 501(c)(3) organization, it is technically illegal, and posing as a non-profit and not paying taxes is a felony. By advocating for political entities (which is what the CPD does with the exclusion of any participants outside of the major parties), the organization you support is committing a crime.

&gt;Any semblance of lack of bias on the CPD's part is completely eradicated when one notes that the organization is headed by the former head of the RNC and Clinton's former press secretary.

&gt;I urge you to please stop supporting this organization until they do what they're supposed to do: promote democracy and voter choice.

&gt;Thank you,

* *FirstName* *LastName*
* *City*, *State*
* *###-###-####* (phone)

**EDIT 1** Here is the contact information for Janet Brown, head of the CPD: 202-872-1020 and jb@debates.org

**EDIT 2** [Here is the source article](http://www.policymic.com/articles/15380/gary-johnson-polls-why-the-cpd-decision-to-keep-him-out-of-the-debates-is-illegal) for more information on why the CPD excluding Gary Johnson is illegal

**UPDATE 1** [I just heard back](http://i.imgur.com/ybFiA.png) from a VP of Communications at IBWA. Here is the e-mail they sent me (note: I have blacked out some of his personal information out of common decency)

The responses you will get from these organizations will be something on the order of ""we don't determine the selection process/have any control over the debates"".

**Here is sample text for any e-mail responses you get**:

**Body**:

&gt;Hello _______,

&gt;Thank you very much for your response. As a point of clarification, neither myself nor anyone you will likely hear from in the coming weeks is under the impression that *ORGANIZATION* has played a role in the participant list or organizational decisions of the CPD.

&gt;Instead, we would like to strongly urge *ORGANIZATION* to cease sponsoring an organization that with the exclusion of a qualified candidate for Presidency (who just polled at 10.6%, well above the 7% Ross Perot polled at when he was included in the debates), is clearly not fulfilling their mission (which is presumably what your company is supporting) to:

&gt;""...ensure that debates, as a permanent part of every general election, provide the best possible information to viewers and listeners.""

&gt;Source: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=about-cpd

&gt;Gary Johnson was a two-term Governor of New Mexico who was one of only a handful of Governors to leave his state with a budget surplus (to the tune of $1B). He has twice the executive experience of Mitt Romney, and is the only Presidential candidate that has balanced a budget in his political career.

&gt;Given the goal of the debates is to present voters with all of the candidates that could win the election and to stimulate the flow of ideas and generate positive discussion surrounding solutions to America's problems, excluding Gary Johnson is both undemocratic and against the best interests of the country.

&gt;In light of this, please consider dropping your support of the CPD.

&gt;Thank you,

Instead of pleading with the news companies to include Gary Johnson in the polls, why not take the free-market approach and pay them to? 

If we can't somehow raise the couple thousands that it would take to field a national poll, then we could do our own unscientific poll by using our own phones. We could post the results and review the data online. Picking random numbers in the phone book is an easy way to do this.

Either way, we can't just sit around and wait for this to happen, the election is coming up fast. We need to know relatively accurately, what our support levels are in various states. Only with the data can we properly run a campaign by focusing on the areas that need it most. 

Let's do this fellow freedom supporters, we need to get this done yesterday.

However in reality: 

* Gary Johnson needs 5% of the ""popular"" vote for ballot access in 2016. 

* The two main candidates need 270 of the ""electoral"" votes to become the president for the next four years. 

So if you were going to vote for any of two main party candidates, your vote is actually wasted because technically electoral votes decide who becomes the next President... not your vote. However, on the other hand, Gary Johnson doesn't need electoral votes, he needs 5% of your votes to get ballot access. 

The irony is that if you consider what I have just said, their votes are being wasted and your votes actually count. Am I right?"	t5_2rxc8	True

A third party can bring serious issues to light that are often glossed over or ignored by Democrats and Republicans. By having a party that is actually willing to take a stance on issues such as marriage equality or marijuana legalization, Democrats and Republicans may be forced to stop giving lip service and vague assurances and put their money where their mouths appear to be.

One of the greatest challenges to this would be to have a repeat of the 2011 Republican debates, where Gary Johnson was almost completely excluded, often because his name was not even taken into consideration on national polls. If we can get Mr. Johnson to 15% on five national polls the Democratic and Republican candidates will be forced to address him, and it will be a win for all Americans. My questions are these: What polls does he need to be on? When do these take place? Who can we talk to in order to ensure he is not excluded.

With this information we can begin building awareness and growing support. Even if people are already set on one major party or the other, it will be beneficial for everyone if they are willing to vote for Mr. Johnson in the polls, and bring a third voice to the debates."	t5_2rxc8	True

[Colorado Proposition 64](http://regulatemarijuana.org/) has received resolutions of support from both the Democratic Party of Colorado **and** the Republican Party of Colorado. Support among voters has been polled at over 50%. Unfortunately, a similar proposition failed in Colorado in 2010 because the opposition was better about securing publicity than the support was.

I think Gary should go to Colorado, smoke a joint, climb a mountain, return from said mountain, and deliver a campaign speech at a rally in favor of Proposition 64.  I am sure there will be rallies hosted by local Colorado groups, and they would love to have a national candidate present. It would give Gary an opportunity to speak directly to one of his strongest support groups [in a state that is already sympathetic to third parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_gubernatorial_election,_2010#General_election_results).

Media Strategy

For television ads, focus on swing states. Focus most of the media in swing states where there is also debate on marijuana legalization and/or there might be upcoming ballot initiatives on marijuana legalization, such as Colorado and Michigan. For a digital campaign, use the ad to pique the interest of young voters who are not strongly partisan and sympathize with marijuana legalization as an issue. Clicking on the ad brings these voters to information that is tailored for that demographic and communicates Gary Johnson's credible stances on other issues.

Media Placements

Network and Cable Television: Target local networks in swing states for networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox, with a focus on high-viewership primetime television. Supplement with exposure in targeted local cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, and ESPN.

Digital: Place video across a blend of efficient video ad networks and high-impact video sites like Hulu, Youtube, Comedy Central website. Place within programs like the Daily Show and The Colbert Report.

M74	28	2	21	I read an article recently which stated that roughly two-thirds of Americans might now consider a third party alternative.  Promising though that may sound, clearly the LP candidate would still need to be invited to the general election debates if he were going to have any meaningful impact.  Ross Perot's campaign was the only event in my lifetime, thus far, which resulted in having a third candidate on stage during the general election cycle.  How did Mr. Perot succeed in finding himself in that position, and how might Gary Johnson do the same?  Given that Mr. Johnson was already muscled-out of the Republican primary debates, should this be considered an entirely unfeasible goal?	t5_2rxc8	True

1345573144.0	ylbru	An idea for a Gary Johnson app: pledge to vote for Johnson with another voter from your state who would have normally voted the opposite of you	captainplantit	34	7	8	"Ok, so I read this really cool story on this subreddit a bit ago about two people, one who would prefer Romney to Obama and the other who would prefer the opposite, making a pledge that they would both vote for Gary Johnson since they thought he was the better candidate. Since their votes would have just canceled eachother out, they wouldn't feel like their voting for who they thought was actually the best candidate would put 'the other guy' in office.

So I was thinking about it: why can't we just make an app that you sign into using your facebook account, you select who you would have normally voted for, and it pairs you up with someone in your state that would have done the opposite?

Now I'm not really a CS guy (I work in management consulting) but I would think if the app required you posted on your facebook something like 'I took the pledge to vote for Gary Johnson with [name of other person]' then it would help keep people honest. I've read about public pledges and their ability to help people quit smoking etc., so I think this would also make sure people would actually vote for Gary Johnson.

For the first rollout I think you would have to exclude swing states to prevent people from trolling the site to try and give their party a leg up, but after it was rolled out and established we could roll it out to swing states.

(without having to ""waste a vote"")"	CapnMead	28	3	12	"   I am disappointed in the number of people I've talked to who say that even though they agree more with his policy than any other candidate, they won't vote for Gary Johnson because if they do then obviously ""the other guy"" will win. In reality, the only way for Gary Johnson to win is for people to vote for him. In what I am hoping will be an act of solidarity, I would like you the reddit community, to show your support so that the people who would not want to ""waste their vote"" in the actual election might have the confidence to make a difference. Leave a comment, upvote, make your presence known. I believe that there are enough people out there to make this election different, and I'd like to see those numbers. 

   If you knew that your vote could be the vote that won the election, would you vote for Gary Johnson. Please send this out to anyone able to vote in the next election who is even considering Gary Johnson, and if you don't know about him I challenge you to check out his [policies](http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/issues) to see if you agree.
 
   My hope is that this experiment could give people the confidence to vote based on conscience instead of fear.

I should say that I have no direct affiliation with Gary Johnson and am not being compensated in any way. I simply feel very strongly that a Gary Johnson win can help to save America from defaulting back to the very system of government that this country was founded to rebel against, and a Gary Johnson loss means that we're all screwed.

What is the best counter argument to this? It seems to me that he will take votes equally from both sides.
This is an argument we must combat if we are truly going to win some votes.

Here are some gems:

""TL;DR: Waste a vote on Gary Johnson so Obama can get re-elected!""

""Good idea, it'll help split the right-wing votes.""

""Sorry, but supporting a third party will only get Republicans elected. That's the sad reality of it.""

""More than the debate it self, the problem I see is that these progressive ideals he has would help take away votes from Obama. This would favor Romney. ""

""guessing the koch brothers would back this idea since he'd probably steal liberal votes and they are trying to buy the election for romney ""

""I don't know if you are a republican agent, trying to pull far left Democratic voters off of Obama, or just stupid.

All this will do is help Romney. That is ALL.""

""Wouldn't this detract from support we could be lending towards, say... Obama?""

This would be positive in three ways: it would energize the youth vote, it would split the right, ensuring that Romney would never win, and it would make the political process more interesting. 

""15% should be good. Romney shouldn't have a problem losing that 15%, it's not like he is going to win this election anyway.""

""VOTE SPLIT ALERT! Liberal third party spoilers increase the chance that the Republican gets elected.""

""Johnson was the Republican governor of New Mexico. He's not exactly ""Liberal.""""

""This sounds remarkably similar to the efforts Republicans made to fund Ralph Nader in 2008 to draw votes away from the Democratic candidate. With Obama and Romney tied neck-to-neck, this could insure a Romney victory.""

""Sounds like Romney's Nader: an un-winnable candidate that will take enough votes away from Obama to allow Mitt to win.""

""Ron Paul's followers were just as enthusiastic as Obama's last time around. It would kill Romney to lose them to Johnson.""

The list goes on and on. This seems to be the most popular type of response to the thread."	t5_2rxc8	True
