Back when I was in high school *cough**cough* years ago, we had to write something called a Controversial Issue essay. It was the big ""term paper"" project, and passing it was a prerequisite for passing the class. We were allowed to pick our own topics, but were asked to avoid the wildly controversial topics such as abortion.

After a lifetime of separate-but-equal office supplies, it occurred to me a topic discussing the mistreatment of left-handers through the ages would make for an interesting topic. When I went to my teacher to clear the topic, she scoffed at me! 

""That's not a *real* issue,"" she said. ""Pick a topic that actually *matters*.""

Struck with a sudden rush of righteous indignation, I proudly proclaimed ""THAT'S exactly the kind of attitude I would expect! Keeping my people down yet again! We'll see what the principal has to say about it!"" 

She laughed at me dismissively, and though I felt a tad silly, the die was cast. So after class I went to see the principal, true to my word. And though he himself was not a southpaw, he empathized with my plight, and told me he would ask the teacher to allow me to use the topic.

I wrote the paper, but the teacher refused to grade it, flabbergasted at my defiance. The principal stepped in again, reading it and ultimately giving me an A. 

I can't be sure, but I believe for the rest of the year, that she instinctively twitched every time I raised my *left* hand to answer a question in class."	t5_2ruq7	True

My whole family is right handed so growing up I was taught how to do things with my right hand (and foot). I was real young so it was simple things like throwing a ball or coloring. Both of which I did poorly. My parents never considered the idea that I should be using the other hand, they just figured I inherited their clumsiness. 


Things go along fine up until first grade. My teacher was quick to notice that I had a lot of trouble with writing. Aside from the lack of ability to make a straight line, I wrote most of my letters backwards. The words would be right but half the letters were mirror images of what the should be.


After a few weeks of coaching I still couldn't get it. After a conference with my teacher, parents and school shrink it was decided that I had a serious learning disability and needed to be moved to special ed. I was devastated. All my old classmates called me dumb, I cried all the time, it was miserable. 


After about two weeks of plodding through my special classes the new teacher decided to try a radical experiment. She took the pencil out of my right hand and put it into my left. I swear it was like a scene straight out of *Miracle Worker*. All of a sudden I could write all my letters correctly. I was flying through my assignments with a great new found confidence. So the teacher decided it was time for another conference. This time they brought the principal in and rather than sending me back to my old class they skipped me ahead to second grade. 


I have been a proud southpaw ever since.

**Cars:** American or European the ignition is always on the right side of the steering wheel. 
  
**Lawnmowers** as well as most small engines have the pull rope mounted to be used with the right hand.
  
**Cameras:** Most controls are operated with the right hand. 
  
**Cellphones:** Volume button designed to be used with index finger rather than thumb. Models with buttons have the end button on the right side and if you hold it left handed your cheek bone hangs up.  

**Guns:** If you don't own one or have never shot then you may not realize that the super hot spent shell almost always ejects to the right which has to cross right in front of your face. Operating the safety of a gun is nearly impossible. There are left handed guns, some shotguns/rifles eject downward, but to just go buy a handgun off the shelf you are very limited in your selection. 
  
**Tweezers:** I have a nice pair of tweezers and I realized one side is much sharper than the other which makes them work better right handed because the thinner side slides under the hair or splinter much easier.  
  
**Circular saws:** Dust in my eyes every time.   
  
**Chainsaws:** For safety reasons i have learned to use right handed (right hand on throttle). Chainsaws are just dangerous and should not be operated any other way than they were designed either left or right handed. 
  
**Most knives:** Most knives in the kitchen have only one edge ground down or they have one side that is flat and the other beveled. When cutting with the left hand and holding with the right the blade tends to scoop outward.  
  
**Measuring cups:** in the US display metric when held with the left hand.

**Please add your personal observations.**

Some background, I draw with my left, but use a mouse with my right. I believe it's called mixed-handed.

I'm an animator working with Flash CS3. My work requires a lot of drawing by hand. Before today, I used Flash's Brush tool, which has a circular cursor. A circular cursor (or other precise cursor, such as a crosshair) isn't hand-dependent, it doesn't imply either left- or right-handedness.

However, I've just run up against a project that requires I switch to this tool, *the Pencil.*

[Cursor of Dread.](http://i.imgur.com/JnrJn.gif)

As a left-hander, drawing with a right-handed cursor is an unusual torture. I can only liken it to drawing with a hook, your brain anticipates the point approaching from the left, but your visual feedback suggests it's coming from the right. This discord throws every line I draw, making work impossible.

The main problem is, there seems to be no option to switch it around, which is infuriating because it seems the simplest of fixes, but alas I cannot find the option.

Windows have a set of left-handed cursors available to replace the default ones, but they have no effect on Flash's own cursors. Hunting through Flash's directory reveals no cursor files, which likely means they are buried in Flash's code.

You can set 'precise' cursors, but they don't apply to the Pencil tool. If you want to use Pencil, it's a right-handed cursor or nothing, and I have no choice but to use it.

It's hugely disappointing, especially from a ""professional"" product, that a basic accessibility option is non-existent. A few lines of code on their behalf would have saved me a world of frustration. My opinion of Flash is fairly low as it is, however, so I'm not sure if I'm surprised.

The only girl I've been in a long term relationship with is left handed. Both girls that I was attracted to last school year turned out to be left handed as well. 

It extends to friendships too, in my experience. When I did a semester abroad in the netherlands, a group of 6 people formed into a friendship since we were like minded. It turned out that 5 out of the 6 were lefties. 

My two favorite teachers at school were both lefties, and both philosophy teachers. Additionally, I feel like my upper division philosophy classes had more lefties than my other classes, sometimes i would count and there were about 30-40% lefties. 

I feel like I've noticed a trend where I relate much more to left handed people. I feel like we share more interests, are disproportionately liberal politically, have bigger imaginations, and have more of a literary intelligence than a mathematical or physical intelligence.

After the 2nd conference with his pre-k teacher regarding his handwriting and cutting skills, we purchased scissors and a couple of pencils, specifically for lefties.  I hyped him up about getting them, as he hated to write and had great difficulty using scissors.  Although I was expecting somewhat of an improvement with the new items, I ever thought I'd see such a huuuuuge difference.

His letters are almost perfectly formed, but you can sort of tell he starts them in a different place and his teacher watches him write. Does anyone else have this habit? Is it a valid lefty adaption? Should I ask her to back off as long as the letters are well-formed? Or am I being petty?

FWIW, he's a very happy and confident kid and he doesn't really seem to care too much about the criticism. My problem actually lies more with how she documents it. She marks down his grade and makes comments about it in his report card and in his file, but doesn't state that he's left-handed so it seems like he's just really uncoordinated or uncooperative. They have a curriculum for teaching and assessing handwriting; it's actually a pretty good system, but it doesn't address issues like this.

1339313391.0	uucs3	"Fellow southpaws, what is the reasoning behind the ""lefty way"" and the ""righty way"" to hold utensils such as golf clubs and baseball bats? Because to me, it makes NO sense. "	Satans_Paw	40	10	29	"So this has been pondering my mind for a long time. As a lefty, I do almost everything left handed, with the exception of using computer mice and toilet paper, but I'm bothered by the classifications of the ""left way"" and the ""right way"" of doing things. 

For example, the ""lefty way"" to hold a hockey stick is to have your right hand on the top and your left hand on the bottom, with the top of the stick angled towards your right shoulder. And the ""lefty way"" to hold a baseball bat is with your left hand on top and your right hand on bottom, with the bat over your left shoulder. Honestly, this makes no sense to me. In both these scenarios, the non-dominant hand is placed at the end of the equipment, which seems wrong...it seems the dominant hand should be placed at the end since it has the most control. That's how I hold them, with the dominant hand at the end of the utensil.

Here's the way I hold things, and my reasoning:

**Pistol**: Held in left hand

**Rifle**: Left hand on trigger with right hand on forestock with the gun resting on my left shoulder

**Hockey Stick**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom with top of stick pointing towards my left shoulder

**Baseball Bat**: Left hand on bottom, right hand on top, held over my right shoulder, standing on the left side of the plate from the umpire's point of view. (or standing on the right side of the plate from the pitcher's point of view)

**Tennis Racket forehand**: Left hand on grip swinging from the mid/bottom left side up to right shoulder

**Tennis Racket backhand**: Left hand on bottom, right hand on top, swinging from my mid/bottom right side up to my left shoulder

**Bow &amp; Arrow**: Left hand back holding arrow, Right hand forward holding bow

**Lacrosse Stick**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom. With my arms at my sides, the pocket faces the right and the butt of the stick faces the left

**Golf Club**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom, standing with my left foot in front and my right foot in the back. (For someone standing directly behind me, I would be to the left of the golf ball)

Here's the part that I don't get: in some of these situations, I'm apparently holding the utensil(s) as a right-handed person would, such as baseball and hockey. This makes no sense to me, as I'm using the same ""rules"" to hold each object: My dominant hand (left) is on the end and my non-dominant hand (right) is above/below that hand depending on the situations....it's in between my dominant hand (left) and the end of the utensil. 

Why aren't all of these the ""left handed"" way? **I mean I'm using the same pattern for each of them, aren't I?** 

I start my reasoning with guns; a lefty obviously holds a pistol with their left hand. And a lefty obviously holds a rifle with their left hand back on the trigger and their right hand up at the forestock (up near the barrel). Therefore, if a lefty were pointing the rifle downwards, in a similar position to the way a hockey stick is held, their left hand would be on top at the trigger and their right hand would be on bottom, near the barrel. 

Now replace that rifle with a hockey stick or golf club. This **SHOULD** be the way a lefty holds a hockey stick or golf club. But it isn't. **WHY?** Similarly, the technically correct way for a lefty to use a backhand in tennis is with the left hand at the end/bottom of the racket with the right hand above the left hand (in between the left hand and the strings), swinging from the bottom/mid right side UP to the left shoulder...this is exactly how my backhand goes, so I'm performing this the ""lefty way."" Shouldn't this mean that a left-handed golfer should have the same hand positioning, also swinging up to the left shoulder from the bottom right side of the body? I mean that's how I also golf. **BUT NO**, the apparently ""correct"" way for a lefty to swing a golf club is to stand to the right of the ball (from the POV of someone standing directly behind you), with you left hand on bottom and right hand on top--the complete opposite of how I golf. 

**So what you're telling me is that if you take a left-handed tennis backhand, replace the racket with a golf club, and perform the same swinging motion, you're performing a right-handed golf swing?**

For me: zero. All my kitchen implements are standard righty variety, I play righty guitar, in fact the only thing I can even imagine buying lefty would be golf clubs, if I ever took up golf.

I think there's even a hint of a stigma to this for me, like buying left-handed stuff and not just coping is somehow being precious and whiny, or even a Ned Flanders-esque left-handedness geek.

I told her I would not, and chose my left hand. Sadly, I wish I didn't have a stupid (she was a very bad teacher) instructor, as I often wish I were still ambidextrous. And that's my story!

When I was in high school (actually in the summer before my junior year), I broke my right arm in three places doing some incredibly stupid stuff.

Anyway, school started back up shortly after I had a cast put on my arm. When we got into our first writing assignment, I had an epiphany. *""No one here remembers I'm a lefty. I should pretend to be right-handed and get someone to write all of my notes for me.""*

Sure enough, I asked the teacher about my situation. She then asked for volunteers to take notes and copy them for me after class. The girl behind me was more than happy to oblige. Luckily, she was in all of my classes and a very good student. No note taking for about 2 months :)

The guitars from top left(of course):
 
1- Seagull S6 Cedar, not a full dreadnought but a beautiful mellow acoustic.

2- Hagstrom Swede, sounds a lot more like a Gibson than any Epiphone I've heard ever has. Heavy, lots of tones, looks awesome.

3- Epiphone SG, one of the really cheap ones. Sounds like crap, looks like crap, plays like crap. Avoid these turd mountains!

4- Cort Artisan 5 string bass, I love this thing, the B string just sounds evil and the neck is comfy. Requires spare batteries to be kept to avoid down-time, no battery no sound. 

5- The shitty acoustic I take to music festivals because I wont take the Seagull there. Literally cost $20, it is decorated with all those free stickers bands hand out, and beer bottle caps. Made purely of plastic and plywood.

6- Cort acoustic, I dont play it because the Seagull is way better. 

Also pictured! My Kurt Cobain ""Action Figure"". He's playing a Fender Jag-Stang, which never went on sale in lefty :-(

I got into this discussion with a friend of mine when talking about learning with the opposite hand.  I naturally play the uke left handed but I have taught myself to play guitar right handed.  My friend attributes my success with right handed guitar to me being ambidextrous even though I insist that learning it was a nightmare.  

I know a lot of left handed people that can use both hands for certain actions including myself but it's a mixed bag of either being forced to learn right handed or simply wanting to learn right handed.  It's hard to say whether or not the success itself stems from the desire to learn or simply being slightly more comfortable with the opposite hand so what are your opinions?

So, I bought [this left-handed mouse](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-hand-edition/) from Razor, and it's pretty awesome.  It fits my hand nicely, handles smooth, no complaints with performance.  It's just that it's huge and has like an 8 foot cord, so I'm not taking it anywhere with me.  I just leave it at my desk, and have a smaller, cordless mouse I keep in my bag for when I'm on the go.

Since the Razor is automatically a left-handed mouse, it works normally when my computer is set to right-handed mode.  But since the normal mouse is automatically right-handed, I need to change my computer setting to switch the left and right clicks.

So basically, my issue is that every time I switch which mouse I'm using, I need to go into my settings and switch the clicks again, which can be pretty annoying, since I'll inevitably click the wrong mouse button somewhere along the way.  What I'd like to do is somehow reprogram the Razor so that it functions just like a normal right-handed mouse, and then I can just permanently have the setting switched on my laptop.

Now: I am [cross-dominant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dominance). My left hand/arm feels stronger and I use it for most things while my right hand/arm feels more accurate and I use it for writing, using the PC mouse, throwing objects, cutting and things that need precision.

Many years later, one random day, I found out that I could write mirrored script with my left hand. It was not that fast and my hand started to hurt after a page (from lack of practice?) but the important thing was that it came naturally to me and I didn't have to think about forming letters/words. This cursive script even resembles my usual right handed handwriting.

So I'm wondering how I gained this knowledge with absolutely no practice. My brain seems to have simply granted mirror abilities to my left hand with no effort.

PS: Unlike [this person](http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/ogsbe/iwtl_how_to_write_left_handed/c3hvxbk) I have not tried to actively write or read mirrored since it's too inconvenient in a non-mirrored world.

I've had this problem for years. Some say I'm ambidextrous, and others say one or the other.

I write terribly with my left hand, but I seem to feel comfortable using it outside of writing. Additionally, on laptops, I use the track pad 50-50 between both hands.

I did a Google and found something like 10-25% of the population are lefties. (This is a big window based on conflicting stats)

I am an electrician,  and I have noticed a very disproportionate number of left handed people within the electrical field. My current workplace runs well more than half and thats out of about 40-50 people. And it is something I have noticed frequently in the past. Especially because standed cable is twisted in a direction that suits right hand plier use, and us lefties tend to claim one another.

Lefty pushers are more disadvantaged when it comes to writing because their hand smears the ink or lead as they write. Lefty hookers ""hook"" their hands around and their writings so it doesn't smear as you write. The difference happens because of how the brain developes.

Lefty hookers actually have a more developed right hemisphere ( it's bigger than the the left side). Which are you?

The poll was submitted to /r/math and /r/southpaws, which explains the high prevalence of left-handedness.

I started the analysis by [removing some answer groups](http://i.imgur.com/X0y1KLM.png) completely, because they may be biased, useless in the analysis, or only had a single answer.

Next up, I gathered the detailed statistics. I used [Fisher's exact test](http://www.langsrud.com/stat/fisher.htm) and tested *all adjacent groups* for significance, as well as well as testing all three ""algebraist"" groups against the corresponding ""analyst"" groups. [None of them](http://i.imgur.com/FZVHZ8m.png) were close to being significant, with many of them having p-values of over 0.90. Technically speaking, that means we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the proportions being identical. Practically speaking, I don't believe for a second there truly is a statistical difference between the groups, any of them.

This would mean that among all groups with a clear and stated preference for how they [eat corn on the cob](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=345x150&amp;chl=In%20spirals%2C%20%5B191%5D%7CIn%20rows%2C%20ma%20%5B334%5D%7COther%20%5B32%5D&amp;chco=ff9900&amp;chd=e%3AV8mXDr), 66.4% eats in rows and the remaining 33.6% eats in spirals. This ignores the ""other"" group, some of which just wanted to say how much they hated the poll, how they didn't really have a preference, but mostly that they don't eat corn while it's on the cob. For details, refer to the first paragraph of this post.

For anyone interested in why anyone would do such a silly poll: I got the idea after I came across [this article](http://bentilly.blogspot.co.il/2010/08/analysis-vs-algebra-predicts-eating.html) via [a comment by ammicha](/r/math/comments/1j9ghw/between_algebra_and_analysis_are_most_people/cbch57f). Clearly, I couldn't reproduce the anecdote, which in my mind means the author had either a highly unusual sample, or there was simply subconscious copying going on between the relevant groups, perhaps due to biased influences by similar peers. I expect it's the latter, due to the perfect correlation in that sample.

**tl;dr** No differences among groups, for every one person eating corn in spirals there're two eating it in rows."	t5_2ruq7	True

The micro balance I'm using is nicer than the ones I've used before and has a fancy double-sliding case that surrounds the balance. The problem is, the case only opens on the right side. That means I have to load the samples (held by tweezers) using my right hand. I am okay using my right hand for most tasks but I just didn't have the fine motor skills. I spilled a few samples and dropped the standard used to calibrate the balance (an absolute no-no). I felt useless and clumsy. I was close to just walking out of the lab because of the mistakes I had made.

So I guess my question to y'all is, are there any lefty researchers out there that have any advice regarding standard lab equipment? I want the experience of working in a lab, but I don't want to jeopardize the research just because I can't use the equipment.

**TL;DR I look like I'm a crappy worker because of biased lab equipment.**"	t5_2ruq7	True

If I had to guess, I'd say maybe 10-25% of games I have will still use the mouse's left button as the primary click even though I have it swapped.

I have mild CP which luckily didn't affect my intellectual development, but did and does affect my coordination on my right side (which oddly means the left side of my brain was injured).  It could be that I am indeed left handed. However, since neither my mother or father is a lefty, but my older sister is (which only happens about 9% of the time), the odds of two righties producing two lefties is pretty slim.

1301462735.0	gei86	Synesthaesia Anyone?	Theditor	1	1	2	"Hi, I was just wondering if Synesthaesia was more common with us South Paws. I don't know if I'd consider what I have totally Synesthaesia, since the stories i hear of people who have it are pretty trippy, but I know I always view time in a circle, with the times of year always in the same places, and months and weeks always in a order in my head. Also when I think of months, days, numbers, and letters, colors are usually attributed to them.

How about you guys? Any southpaws that can make that claim?"	t5_2ruq7	True

In the past months I have been working to be fluent with my right hand. I brush my teeth with my right hand, eat with my right, and am trying to re-learn to write with my right.  Do you guys think it is ok to try and re-learn everything, or should I just deal with life like a left handed person.	t5_2ruq7	True

As she just graduated from HS and we are in the market for a left handed camera for a graduation gift I thought I'd come here to seek advice.
