1365689471.0	1c4ve1	I used to fight AGAINST people in a cage (UFC) now I fight FOR people in Congo (Pygmies). I'm Justin Wren AMA (verified by Mods)	TheManWhoLovesUs	752	128	228	"I'm Justin Wren. 
-I was the youngest heavyweight on The Ultimate Fighter ""Heavyweights."" (21 &amp; 22 years old)
-Drug addiction took over my life... At 23 I OVERCAME it!
-I'm only 25 and more than capable of fighting against people... But now I'm fighting FOR people. I'm fighting slavery. Maybe one day I'll fight in a cage again.

Congo:
-In September of 2012 I took my second, one month jungle journey to the Pygmies in Congo... I saw with my own eyes 60 men, women, and children slaves be set FREE and on their OWN land for the FIRST time in history. 
-I also ALMOST stepped on a black mamba that was thrown out of the hut next to mine... I would have died in 20-30 minutes if bitten. 
-I had Andibo's blood on my hands, a 1 and a half year Pygmy slave son who was rejected hospital treatment for being an ""animal"" according to the hospital staff... I buried him the next day. 
-I was invited into the Pygmy tribe as family. The name given to me is Eféosa, meaning: ""The Man Who Loves Us""

The ripple effect of helping see 60 slaves free'd has DOUBLED! Now it is 120 former slaves on 60 acres of land and they are getting ready for their second harvest. 

Now I am trying to risk my life to save 1,000. I'm trading this ultimate comfort zone of the USA for the ultimate conflict zone of the eastern Congo... For a full year. I'll live in a twig and leaf hut. I'll sleep on dirt, sometimes mud (in the rainforest).

I'm quitting normal... I'm rejecting the status quo... I'm giving everything I got for my Pygmy family... I quit ""The American Dream"" and pursuing my Congo dream! 

So far I've raised OVER $32,000 to do it! $50,000 will allow me and the oldest &amp; most respected university in Congo free 1,000 slaves... MINIMUM.

In the last 6 weeks it's been featured on Jimmy Kimmel, The Today Show, TMZ, Joe Rogan Experience and last week it was the TOP story pick on Sports Illustrated... Plus Brazilian, Japanese, and Norwegian tv.

BTW: I LOVE CATS!!! Okay, AMA!

***EDIT*** I am back on live! But I am checking to get Mod approval to move this over to IAmA because I have THREE days to hit my goal for fundraising... $17,000 away from setting 1,000 SLAVES FREE! 

***3 days left to hit my donation goal! Help me share it, tweet it, and give if you can!*** You can get the ACTUAL handprint of the slave that you set free! You can get the handprints of the FAMILY you free... Like this! http://i.imgur.com/xM4jI.jpg You can get t-shirts too... Like these AWESOME sweet rough draft. http://i.imgur.com/z43922b.png

1350623898.0	11qfj0	Just Hung out with Jon Jones half an hour ago	beingnonbeing	717	166	169	"I live in the same town as him and ran into him at the bar. When I asked him, he said it's not hard for him to make 205 but 195 would be really difficult (concerning catchweight against Silva). He said he's walking around at 225. We also chatted about other fight-related issues. He was approachable and liked to joke around.

EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting down-voted for saying I'm not Jones... The main reason I posted this was because he was indicating he couldn't make 195 to fight Silva. And no, I didn't take a photo with him.


EDIT: Here are some things we talked about if you care:

-Picked Benson over Nate. He mentioned how Ben's difficult to submit and can kick while Nate doesn't have much kicks. Also mentioned Ben believing in a higher power.

-He asked if people cheered for him at the local Buffalo Wild Wings. And they did. Said he wouldn't have tapped to Vitor's armbar ""I wouldn't have let that happen"".

-My friend challenged a dance-off and he obliged. He was dancing anyway before he came and sat with us (after I told him I was a fan). 

-My friend (casual MMA fan) asked what it was like to punch someone in the face. He said it feels great and he always wished he'd punched harder when it actually lands.

-Said hoped he proved he wasn't afraid to fight Chael. 

-Mentioned he felt John McCarthy was being a bit unfair, telling Vitor to not grab the fence and to push off it (said it sounded almost like coaching). And the fact that ref let Vitor try to headkick him at the start while he was on all fours. Also acknowledged McCarthy is overall a good ref and we both agreed Herb Dean was best. When asked, he said he never felt that 'unfairness' from a ref before. 

-Called Anerson a master regarding last fight. When asked if AS was being disrespectful he said no, it was awesome, it was an art. 

That's about all I can recall. I don't have proof so you can take it however you want. And thanks for the positive feedback."	t5_2qhj4	True

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:UFC_145) is the talk page from the latest event (spoilers).

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mtking) shit stain is Mtking. He slapped the notability tag on every MMA event possible (BAMMA, Strikeforce, UFC, etc.). His excuse is that MMA events are not notable, so they should all be deleted. Look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeforce_Challengers:_Bowling_vs._Voelker) Strikeforce page for instance. Mtking already proposed it for deletion and it will be gone 6 days from now. Check his edit history, you'll see he's been very busy the past few weeks trying to delete MMA pages. If you look at Mtking's edits, you'll notice he/she also *loves* America's Next Top Model. No notability issues there, apparently Mtking enjoys the show quite a bit. My head is about to explode. 

I have no pull in Wikipedia. I'm putting this out there in case any of you do. I'd hate to see the colossal wealth of information there go to waste by one stroke of the keyboard. If anyone can stop this piece of shit from killing that information, please do. "	t5_2qhj4	True

I've had well over 30 fights, including more than a few in some ""wild wild west"" shows pre-regulation (hence why there aren't quite as many fights on my online record). 

Pretty much anything is fair game! And I'd like to start with this: my name has been Weedman for my entire life. I've heard quite a few cannabis jokes, and will **only**be upvoting the most original. 

The gauntlet has been thrown, you cheeky bastards...

Thanks for being an awesome community to the fighters as well, there are lots of forums for MMA on the internet but win or lose everyone here on reddit has been supportive and positive! Thanks r/mma!

EDIT: been typing away for like 2 hours.. taking a short break to play some Diablo.. be back in a bit hopefully the questions don't pile up too high :)

EDIT2: Thanks for all the questions I was honored to be asked to do an AMA and glad I could answer all your questions!  I'll keep an eye on the thread for stragglers who missed out on asking questions yesterday!


Enough people have asked:

Twitter : JimmyCrashBJJ - good quick way to interact

Instagram - JQCrash25 - Don't know why I have this, but I do basically just to post my twitter pics

Facebook - I don't respond to random friends requests anymore my Facebook became a mess of people I don't know.. I post most things MMA related to my fan page Jimmy ""Crash"" Quinlan on Facebook anyway

XBox Live - JQCrash25 - also pretty much ignore random friend requests and messages here.. message me on reddit or twitter or something if you want to play

BattleTag - JQCrash25#1131 for Diablo, multiplayer is kinda dead right now but if you were interested in seeing how much of a nerd I am you can look at my profile"	t5_2qhj4	True

Regardless, he has given a shot to fix the issue, albeit unintentionally. He has cited flimsy justification for his, and the actions of the other wiki editors involved, and he has literally just stopped talking.

Here is the thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/133rqk/wikipedia_isnt_out_to_burn_mma_coverage_to_the/[1]

Take a look. There is something really fishy going on with this whole issue, it's easy to see, and now there are ex wikipedia editors on the /r/subredditdrama thread about this issue confirming some of our worst suspicions, that these guys are power-tripping. Hard. And under the guise of cleaning up standards on Wikipedia. Smh. So if I didn't believe it before, I do now. I would say it would be fair to assume the same on your part.

I started the  thread on /r/subredditdrama[2] because what this boils down to, to me at least, is blantant and unjustified censorship by a small group of editors at wikipedia with an agenda against the UFC, MMA, call it whatever you want, they seem to have a very specific outcome in mind that's not favorable to the every day MMA fan, and they seem like they're not interested in compromise.

Here is the /r/subredditdrama[3] thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/134d12/may_2012prominent_wikipedia_editor_mtking_begins//[4]

I submitted a thread here to not only hopefully highlight hasteur's obviously sketchy agenda to people outside of /r/mma[5] that may be very interested in that behavior by a wikipedia editor, but to also signal to hasteur, that this issue is a lot more serious than he seems to think it is, and if it wasn't before, it certainly is to me now, and I'm one who chose to stay un-involved in the whole issue before this all happened..

If you care about this subreddit, the sport of MMA, and being able to, in some small or large way, prevent our access to it all from being a victim of small group of sketchy people with a sketchy agenda, please do what you can to bring attention to this issue. Or we lose the credibility to ever discuss this matter on /r/mma[6] ever again after today."	t5_2qhj4	True

Shame it didn't get more attention - did horribly at the box office but really is a great movie. Actually made me look at mma quite differently after I saw it. If you haven't seen it yet you def should check it out, it's available for free with [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/Warrior/dp/B006G3MZRQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371588815&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=warrior)

EDIT: It's apparently available on netflix streaming as well

SAME EDIT BUT DIFFERENT THING: I found this interesting, because I think most mma fans would agree that it's great but not THAT great. But to get that many votes I'm guessing lots of non-mma fans must have really liked it - possibly even more than mma fans who find super technical plot holes regarding how promotions are run, who would qualify for a same night tournament, regulations etc etc. Could be that if we're willing to look past those technicalities it really just is a great movie

[SPOILERS]	The_Demolition_Man	452	147	349	"As time goes on, and I learn more about the sport, I always find that I appreciate what a chess match MMA is at the highest levels.    It comes down to so much more than just brawling, but most MMA fans will never appreciate this.

Nick Diaz is a nightmare of a fighter.   GSP was wrong: Fitch was not the Terminator, Nick Diaz is.   Nick Diaz has an iron chin, is not afraid to eat shots, constantly presses forward, and throws an enormous volume of punches straight down the pipe at his opponent's faces.  He never gets tired and he never quits. Once he gets someone pinned against the cage, he's basically unbeatable.   

His little brother Nate used the exact same strategy against Cerrone, and made a multiple time Muay Thai champion look like an amateur striker.   Nick pressed BJ Penn against the cage, and decisively outboxed one of MMA's greatest all time boxers.    Not even Paul Daley, a man notorious for his punching power, could do enough damage to Nick to even slow him down.

Condit knew this, and he refused to fail where his predecessors had.  Much like a bullfighter dodges a bull, Carlos would not have any of Nick's 'bullying' strategy.  He knew how to circle out and not get pinned against the cage.

Make no mistake about it, Carlos was not afraid to trade strikes with Nick. The Fightmetric proves this. But everytime Nick started to get the upperhand, Carlos moved out of danger.    He fought a perfect match.     Carlos's movements were downright graceful, and well timed.  Much like ""Judo"" translates to the ""gentle way,""  Carlos refused to absorb the brunt of Nick's offense.   He traded while he was winning, and immediately moved when Nick started landing.

I don't think most people understand the amount of skill and **discipline** it takes for a fighter to be able to pull off a gameplan like this.    Most fighters with Condit's resume would have fallen in love with their fists and tried to take Diaz's head off when the first taunts came.   But again Condit would not have any of it.   Condit trusted his striking enough to trade with Diaz on his own terms, but gracefully refused to play into Diaz's hand.

Unfortunately, there is a rush of people complaining that Condit refused to actually 'fight' Diaz and that he kept running away.  These people can't understand how masterfully Condit beat Diaz.   It was perfect.   He could not have been any more of a Kryptonite to Diaz's Superman.  

Condit had the brains to figure out the plan, the talent to execute the plan, the conditioning to see it through, and the discipline to stick to it.   This, ladies and gentlemen, is true talent.   It is marvellous.  We just witnessed a great fight, and it is a shame and a blackeye for the sport as a whole that anyone would expect Condit to brawl with Diaz against the cage otherwise suffer being called a coward.


Please, appreciate MMA for not only the violence, but also the athleticism, the talent, and the IQ it takes to not only win, but to win against the best of the best.

**TL;DR  People shouldn't call Carlos a coward.   They should appreciate how masterfully he beat Diaz.**

EDIT:  It seems that a lot of people are bringing up the point that they're upset that Condit chose to fight for points instead of a finish.   There's a lot to be said for this, although personally I would say that Condit did mostly the same things that he always does - flying knees, headkicks, spinning backfists- things that normally knock people the fuck out.   The only difference was the constant pressure that Diaz put on him which didn't let him setup as accurately or with as much power.   Also Nick has a monster chin.  Meh, styles make fights.

EDIT 2: Hmm, seems like most anti Condit arguments boil down to the fact that people are upset that he wasn't willing to brawl.   A lot of people are saying it's 'bad for the sport.'   I don't see how, unless you're appealing to fans who just want to see a brawl.   If that's your position, you may as well advocate banning clinches, ground games, or really anything that doesnt involve standing toe to toe and trading head punches.  "	t5_2qhj4	True

George Sotiropoulos was my BJJ coach for a little over a year. He's a nice enough guy, kind of quite and reserved. I guess as you would expect. Really wasn't training much MMA at the time, and no-one thought his career would take off due to his age.

Also because his talent was eclipsed by Hector Lombard who trained at the same gym, he is the fucking scariest person I've ever met in the flesh. Really intimidating but not in a way hes trying to make a point, he is genuinely just a guy that gives you the chills. 

He didn't have any friends that I knew of. I asked our trainer once why? He said Hector doesn't want friends. To this day I don't know if he's joking or not. But from my experience; Hector views all humans as fleshy judo ragdolls. 

This was in the early days so maybe 2001-2002. Hector would be constantly sparring guys in this little ring in the corner of the gym while my BJJ class was going on. He would be straight up wrecking dudes. No light sparring. All you could hear half the time while rolling was Hector yelling and guys getting slammed all over the place.

So when I heard stories that guys at ATT were saying Hector spars too hard, I wasn't surprised. 

Also, that motherfucker can DANCE. Went to a party once and he was there putting moves on that would make Anderson Silva blush. 

Interested to hear r/mmas other experiences with MMA fighters.

I cant think of any PBP/announcer combo as good as Joe/Goldie.  The timing, volume, &amp; honesty is really the trifecta that makes them so good.  I'm sure a lot of it has to do w/ Joe being a comedian (a large part of comedy being timing &amp; inflection).

Ken Flo &amp; Anik haven't been doing a bad job, i'm not saying that.  But it just isn't the same (or as good imo).

The only other ones that i can even stand listening to would be Bas  (not Michael Schiavello, everything's a porn joke or a ""goodnight irene"" [his wife's name too btw]) &amp; Jimmy Smith (bellator).  Guy Mezger &amp; Mat Hume don't do it much but they seem to have potential too.

Strikeforce is so bad i literally watch it muted.  

That's not a joke, I'm serious; i actually mute it because Mauro Renallo &amp; Frank Shamrock make my ears bleed (that part is not literal).  Everything is over-exaggerated to the point where it's irritating; + it doesn't help that Mauro screams at the top of his lungs non-stop either.  Frank is just boring (&amp; has a history of being douchey), plus talking through braces sounds plain weird.  Miletich is about the only saving grace, but he's still very mediocre imo.

p.s.  if any of you are wondering why i started this thread it was because [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/u1lpo/joe_rogan_and_rampage_jackson_make_friends/) made me realize just how much about-the-sport Joe makes it."	t5_2qhj4	True

1365959968.0	1cc0qc	An Extract From Chael Sonnen's Book Where He Talks About His Wrestling Coach and How He Was Trained	nahin123	332	66	73	"Coach Pitman’s commitment to the team was insane. At one point, he was invited to go on *The Oprah Winfrey Show* to discuss how his wrestling program was changing the lives of kids who’d had a rough go, and he agreed to appear. But when he found out that he couldn’t tape the show on a Saturday or Sunday, that he would have to show up at the studio during the week and miss wrestling practice, he canceled. Yes, Coach Pitman gave up a chance to be on *Oprah* to ensure that we snoty kids got the atention he felt we deserved.

Another time after practice he held up two front-row center tickets to the Bulls–Trail Blazers game. The Bulls had Scotty Pippen and Michael Jordan then. With Nike’s headquarters in Portland, the only place Jordan was more popular was Illinois. So Coach Pitman holds up these tickets and asks which one of us wanted to go. Every last one of us held up a hand. Then he said, “The game is on Friday night at seven, the same time we have practice. Who still wants to go?” Every one of us kept his hand raised. And you know what he did? He ripped those tickets to shreds and vehemently threw the scraps to the ground. 

“Do you know why you won’t go watch Michael Jordan?” he asked. No one said a word. “Because when you are competing on Saturday, he will be at practice. And that is exactly where you will be when he is performing on Friday.” With that said, he made us all do twenty-five pushups. 

Excuses did not exist in Coach Pitman’s world, so he didn’t alow them to exist in ours. There were days when we could hear gunshots outside, and there were days when the windows high above us would shatter, either from bullets or rocks. We never knew the cause because we weren’t alowed to stop wrestling, not even for a moment. When sirens started howling outside, Coach Pitman would simply get up and lock the doors. He would say to us, “You can’t lose focus, not even for half a second. If you suckas think half a second isn’t a long time, then I want you to go home and turn on the burner on your stove. I want you wait until it is glowing hot, and then I want you to set your palm on that burner for a half a second. Then I want you to come back here and tell me half a second isn’t a long time.”

 I can truly see the wisdom behind his words now. A half a second of lost focus can be an eternity, and it can also shater a man’s hopes and dreams. Need an example? Look no further than my fight with Anderson Silva. '

He did the whole damn press conference all in English, with no earpiece or translator, answered all the questions well, and only once or twice did he seem to slightly hesitate. His accent is very minimal, on par with Maia and Belfort (to be fair and compare him with other Brazilians), the former being well educated and the latter having spoken English for 15 years or so. If we all remember, when he fought Gonzaga, Cro-Cop, etc. he didn't use English at all, it wasn't even that long ago.

I do have SOME friends, but their ignorance is just aggravating at times. I can only take so many jokes about a guy being in guard looking homo or complete disrespect of all ground-fighting in general. 

How well accepted/enjoyed is MMA around your area?

Edit: I am absolutely shocked at the number of lone-viewers. I was hoping that MMA had progressed further in popularity, but as some have said the hype machine fallacy is strong.

Who here has an existing streaming service that would allow some of us foreveralones to have a session? A google hangout perhaps?

It seems that MMA regulating bodies, particularly the NSAC, have deemed  it acceptable for a fighter to be on TRT if they are prescribed it by a doctor as part of medical therapy.  Dan Henderson, Frank Mir, and Chael Sonnen have all received exemptions for fights in the past.  While fighters who have been prescribed medical marijuana by doctors, Nick Diaz and Matt Riddle, have never been offered such an exemption.  I understand that marijuana is currently a federally banned substance in the US, which adds a legal compliance issue to the debate over offering fighters exemptions for THC.  I don't believe that the two drugs should be compared to each other because they are completely different in their effects, but I am against offering exemptions for one drug prescribed by a doctor while not doing so for another, but hey thats just my two cents.  I am interested in hearing how other fighters and fans feel about the issue of drug use in MMA.

1338759746.0	uj473	"I just finished reading ""Big"" John McCarthy's book. Some thoughts..."	iluvurkidz	274	41	105	"Just finished John's autobiography, [Let's Get It On](http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Get-It-On-Ultimate/dp/1605421413), and it's an absolute joy. You learn about his days in the LAPD (22 years), including the LA riots following the Rodney King incident (John knew two of the guys in the beating video), his family, his referee certification and training center (COMMAND), funny and interesting moments on the road and with fighters and fans and officials, the inside workings of MMA, and lots of other things. 

Some points in the book:

* John worked incredibly hard for the legalization of MMA. He did amazing work behind the scenes that fans don't know about, including endless meetings, presentations and lobbying, especially in the beginning when MMA was combated. Whenever there was trouble with a politician or commission, ""send John"" was the usual solution. 

* The boxing establishment worked very hard to kill MMA and used corrupt politicians like John McCain to achieve that, that's well known. But what I didn't know is that McCain is a huge boxing fan, and his wife was tied to one of the distributors for Anheuser-Busch, one of boxing's biggest sponsors. McCain watched boxing matches in which people died later from the head trauma and said nothing, yet attacked MMA mercilessly for its 'barbarity'. One of the most pathetic moment in his anti-MMA war is when he complained that MMA fights have no referees, exposing the fact that he never watched a single MMA match, despite all his anti-MMA bullshit propaganda.

* McCarthy does not like reffing fights where one fighter has a huge advantage over the other one. He made his opinions on this issue known, and this cost him more than once. One time was when he was pulled from the main event of UFC 59. It was the first time he didn't officiate a UFC main event. The reason is that a month before that, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) offered McCarthy the job to ref a fight between Cesar Gracie and Frank Shamrock in Strikeforce, which would've been the first regulated MMA event in the state. McCarthy turned it down because it was badly uneven, as Shamrock is a veteran and Gracie is a BJJ fighter with no experience dealing with strikes. CSAC didn't like this, so they pulled him from the UFC's main event as punishment. And John turned out to be right: the fight [ended in 20 seconds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AljXZHxts9s) after Shamrock struck Gracie in the face. 

* Another was UFC 67. Mirko Cro Cop was about to debut in the UFC, and they gave him Eddie Sanchez, who was far inferior in striking capabilities, and McCarthy felt Sanchez was being fed to Cro Cop merely to be a part of his highlight reel. Members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission asked him when they were all on the set of The Ultimate Fighter about who'd win that match, and McCarthy told them that it's not a matter of who'd win; it's which row would Sanchez's head land in after Mirko uses his lethal left kick to kick his head clean off, and Keith Kizer (the executive director of the NSAC) called him and told him he'd pulled him from officiating the card because of those comments. Apparently NSAC is composed of vindictive and gossippy little girls.

* The reason the commissions can do this is because they are the boss and John reports to them, like other referees. In the beginning, the refs had only one boss: the UFC, or whatever promotions they were working for. 

* Nick Diaz verbally taunts his opponents, with stuff like ""Come on bitch, fight! What's wrong, bitch?"", and McCarthy threatened to deduct points if Diaz persisted, since that stuff is apparently not allowed as per MMA commission rules. 

* When he was about to open his MMA gym, Dana White discouraged him because MMA gyms bled money (Dana owned two), but White helped him anyway, hooking him up with suppliers and advice. 

* As a police officer, he was shot at more than once, and as an MMA referee, he saw some bloody and gruesome things (not all televised), but his most frightening moment was when his son Ron almost drowned in the ocean and he jumped in to save him. 

* Pride folded because of a magazine article linking them to the Yakuza mob, which confirmed suspicions surrounding Pride for a while.

* After working day and night to kill MMA, the boxing establishment now wants a piece of the pie, after the regulation and success of MMA. The state athletic commissions have been hiring MMA-inexperienced boxing referees and judges, some of whom ""can't tell an armbar from a heelhook"", according to John, and many bad calls have been made and fighters well-beings jeopardized. 

* When a fighter is caught in a submission and he screams in pain, it is considered a tapout. John explains this rule (along with all the others) to fighters before every event. In UFC 71, Din Thomas had Jeremy Stephens in an armbar and Jeremy screamed in pain as his arm was deeply hyperextended, and John stopped the fight. Stephens immediately protested, and when John reminded him of that rule, he ""deflated like a balloon"".

It's over 400 pages, yet there's never a dull moment, something I almost never see in books. There's tons of fascinating stuff about MMA and John's life, including his interactions with the gangs of LA (he says he believes now those gangsters cannot be rehabilitated, and they will live and die as criminals, seeing so many of them that he arrested get released and then commit crimes and get arrested over and over again). Time just flew as I read it. I highly recommend it, it's a gem of book, and John has led one of the most interesting lives I've come across."	t5_2qhj4	True

And then Joe starts the interview and the people in arena are fucking booing him. **Booing** him. Sorry, but this really pissed me off. JDS is a genuinely nice guy who was at the lowest point in his career (possibly his life) at that moment, and they fucking boo him. Disgraceful.

I had read he was moving back to New Zealand for his camp and thought I'd be able to go to a signing or something at some point, but never expected to see him walking around. He was with one other guy, going into a movie theater.

Our exchange went like this:

&gt;Me: Hey, Mark [extend hand]

&gt;[Hands were shaken]

&gt;Me: Good luck with JDS

&gt;Mark: Thanks

I think he was just as surprised as I was. He didn't even stop walking. Knowing how much of a recluse he is, I decided not to bother him any more and let him go about his business.

After watching MMA for so long , my eyes just scream fake and the suspension of disbelieve in regards to the plot just goes out the window.

[What do people think of something like this?](http://i.imgur.com/sL6rk.png)


I wanted to make something sooner but have been flat out with other commitments as of late. I'm happy to bounce ideas around but I figure this is a decent starting point as far as refreshing the logo goes?

Anyone agree/disagree?

Junior genuinely sounded like his heart was broken when he said ""Why do you guy do dis?"" It was honestly one of the grossest displays of MMA fandome I've seen in the 10 years I've been watching the sport. Shame on all of them.

For 4 weeks I trained every day, I watched what I ate (I had to go from 77kg to 72kg) and I admit, I could not sleep last night. I went to the gym 2 hours earlier because I couldn't stay at home, I felt like my head was going to explode. My mother cried for me (""OMG YOU ARE GONNA GET KILLED!"") and my father was not very happy either (""I never knew you were so fucking retarded"").



Match was 9minutes (3mins x3) and ones it was over I could barely stand. Worst part was waiting for the judge to decide who won the fight, all I could think was ""God just let me sit down before I fall"". But in the end I won, got the trophy, drank beer with my opponent and now I am getting ready to celebrate.

Instead though most of the new posts get deleted for spoiler rule violations and what's left is too vague to generate a strong reaction. By the time the spoiler period is over most of the enthusiasm has subsided and most discussion is responding to articles about the fights instead.

What percentage of the 34000 subscribers care about spoilers? If it's small, is it fair to ask them to unsubscribe before events? I know that people can use RES to Ignore Keywords, so maybe *anything* should be fair game as long as it includes ""SPOILER"" in the title? I'm guessing that it's a lot of the same people who want spoiler protection for each card so maybe they should be responsible for their own content. 

Another idea was maybe to have separate *post-event* discussion threads for each fight since the official thread is really just for immediate reactions. 

Any ideas? Personally I think the RES keyword feature would keep everyone happy with minimal effort.

1352642120.0	130c46	I was there live at UFC Macau; here are a bunch of random thoughts. (SPOILERS obviously)	Mr_FreNezY	253	56	75	"It was my first UFC event... I had been to small/medium-sized shows before, and I was pretty stoked to see the actual UFC, after watching it for years. Here is what I thought:

- The view was excellent! I was in the upper balcony, and could see really well. My ticket cost ""only"" 680 MOP, about 80$ I think.

- People told me that the crowd really makes the difference and can add or take a lot out of the whole experience. Well, as can be expected from a place like Macau, the crowd was pretty damn eclectic: most Chinese/Hong Kongers were clearly first-timers, pretty quiet and just appreciating the show, there was only a handful of muscular dudes in matching kickboxing/MMA/grappling gym t-shirts and hats (compared to upwards to 50% at other shows I've been to), and some rich little brats from every ethnicity possible accompanied by dolled up trophy whores who didn't seem to care about the fights and were often seen walking in and out. 

- What I was dreading though were the douchebags, and there definitely were a few: there was a painfully 'Merican stereotype a few seats ahead of me, booing all the time, screaming ""Stand them up!"" when a guy had full back control and was working, and saying dumb shit like ""Chuck Liddell would destroy them both!"" or ""They should do like boxing, where if they clinch they separate them!"" *cringe*

- There were also quite a lot of Brazilians, including a group right in front of me. They were nice and undisruptive enough, except when the Thiagos were fighting of course. Cheering for your guy is cool, but never shutting the hell up is not, and then one of them started screaming some racist shit; even knowing no Portuguese I could hear the words Buddha, sushi and even at some point ""puta japonês!""... I told him he (DHK) is Korean, not Japanese, and he said ""Oh really?! I thought he was Japanese because of the flag over there"", pointing at the Korean flag... *double cringe*

- It was cool to see the little details that go in the preparation of the TV show, the guy giving visual cues to Bruce Buffer and the refs to coordinate with the commentating, the camera crews moving around the place, the guys opening the doors, little things like that I knew existed but never saw just from watching the events on TV. I was surprised there was not much downtime either, maybe there would have been if there were more finishes, but no, once they started it was pretty fluid.

- Bruce Buffer tripped and almost fell when stepping in the cage once. Also, he doesn't even read his cue cards, he must rehearse pretty well  beforehand. I still think he's got a pretty damn sweet job.

- Jon Anik should never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever attempt to speak Chinese again. And while we're at it, why didn't they just get a random Mandarin speaker (there are 1 500 000 000 worldwide, mustn't be hard to find) to teach them the proper pronunciation of Tie Quan Zhang?! That made me grind my teeth in pain every time I'd hear it...

- Speaking of the wolf, seems like it was his fight to lose but the guy's got some balls. I thought he was a FW, for sure he was much smaller than Tuck and lost some grappling exchanges because of this. When he got this weird inverted triangle at the end of R1, I was screaming, because I though he'd won.

- While it wasn't the best card eva, I did enjoy all the fights. Sure, it was decision-heavy, but to me it means the fights were well matched and the fighters tough as motherfuckers. Urushitani and Houghland would have been knocked out silly by those shots if they were not crazy tough. My highlights for the lower card were Caceres vs Tezuka, and Gomi vs Danzig, although it always pains me when at the end of such a close and entertaining fight only one guy has to be declared winner... ah well. Their enthusiasm was contagious though, and the post fight of Gomi/Danzig was hilarious!

- DHK vs Thiago, I was ambivalent: of course, part of me wanted more action (for my own sake, and to shut the aforementioned douchebag up) but at the same time, I appreciate every style of fighting and Kim's for that one was a pretty smart and effective one... sure, it might be boring to watch, but the dude's here to win (to not get to 1-3 in his last 4), not just entertaining our asses, and it is still kinda cool to see a legit badass like Thiago get completely neutralized. Plus, when he went absolutely Godzilla Smash at the end it's hard to deny that was some pure violence. I could hear the thuds all the way where I was!

- Nedkov kinda disappointed me... I thought he looked good against Cané last year, but he is pretty undersized and gassed crazy. Maybe at 185 he could be a good gatekeeper, but I can't see him doing much at LHW. 

- And the main event... need I say more?! I too almost thought Franklin had died. He was on the canvas, completely still for minutes. Good for Le, both guys are such nice dudes that you can only get happy and sad at the same time when one of them triumphs like that.

So that's it... your thoughts on the event?"	t5_2qhj4	True

1250614926.0	9bsfm	Here's a cool anecdote from Forrest Griffin's book that I thought other Redditors might like. Yes, I typed out three pages just for you. Enjoy!		230	30	120	"The toughest dude on the planet is not competing in the UFC or any other MMA organization. He doesn't train in the martial arts, shoot roids into his ass cheeks, or even hit the heavy bag. He couldn't have. From the looks of him, it's impossible. I don't know his name or what he's been up to for the past six years, but I'll never forget his face.  


Back when I was attempting to play football for the University of Georgia, I'd occasionally catch a ride with a group of meatheads who were also attempting to play football. One afternoon, four of us were packed into a Jeep with the top down, cruising around for a while, when someone had the bright idea to go down to Georgia Tech and harass some of the smart folk. With nearly a thousand pounds of muscle, fat, and attitude weighing down our ride, we trolled around campus. I wasn't exactly sure what my cohorts had in mind until one of the guys jumped out of the Jeep while it was still rolling and headed straight for the only person in sight. The target happened to be the biggest geek I had ever seen. Now, I'm not calling this kid a geek because he had more brains than all of us combined and actually *went* to class, but he was five nine, packed at best a hundred twenty pounds, wore a button-down shirt, and had, in his breast pocket, half a dozen pens crammed into a plastic protector. But there's more. He had on horn-rim glasses and hugged a handful of books to his chest like a ten-year-old schoolgirl. Hands down, he was the most pathetic-looking kid in existence.  


So what does the dickhead who jumped out of the Jeep do? He goes straight up to the kid, slaps his books out of his hands, and then begins laughing at him and calling him names. Dork, dipshit, fuck nuts--he let this kid have it. Pretty early on in the verbal assault, I suggested that we get moving and, to expedite our departure, started to say that the cops would be showing up. Now, I was certain this short, scrawny kid would begin wailing and running in circles, which only would have prompted this asshole I was with to chase after him. It would have been a horrible (although hilarious) sight to watch--a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound linebacker chasing down a hundred-and-twenty-pound kid, pens flying everywhere. But that's not what our geek chose to do. Out of nowhere, he charged directly at my dickface associate and swung for the hills.  


I couldn't fucking believe it. Swear to God, the football player was so big that even if you had ten buddies getting your back, you'd still think twice about charging him. And here, this little kid was doing it all on his own, petite fists looping through the air like mosquitoes. But before the kid could land a single shot, the football player cracks him and he goes down. I thought that would be it. The kid had probably watched too many kung fu movies and thought he was some kind of tough guy. Daniel-san or some shit. Anyone who saw this exchange would have figured now that he'd taken one to the face, he would stay down and play dead. That's not what happened. Getting socked only seemed to fuel his passion for justice. He popped back up like a weeble-wobble and again charged forward.  


By this time, another one of the guys in the Jeep had jumped out. Harnessing the pack mentality, he grabbed the kid by his neck, dragged him over to the edge of a grassy slope, and threw him down it. The kid tumbled head over tail, but when he reached the bottom, he didn't lie there in a tattered heap. He came storming back up the hill. When he reached the top, he stopped for a moment, casually removed his glasses, set them down on the grass, and then panned his eyes back and forth between his two assailants. The four words that came hissing out of his mouth will be etched into my frontal lobe for an eternity.  


""I'M READY TO DIE!""  


He began to charge at five hundred pounds of muscle. He ran straight into one of them and knocked him backwards into the Jeep, producing a decent-size dent. This naturally angered the driver, so he jumped out and joined in on the ""fun."" Together, they began beating the holy hell out of this kid. They'd throw him down, kick him in the guts and back, and then begin to walk away. Before they could make it five feet back to the jeep, the kid would leap up again and charge them. So they'd smack him around, throw him down again, and do some more kicking. All the while the kid threw his fists for all he was worth, head butting, trying to bite. Meanwhile, I'm urging these boneheads to get moving.  


After this went on for a little while, I could see the fear growing in the eyes of my fellow football-player wannabes. They weren't worried about this kid causing them damage with his fists--they were scared of his heart and soul. It suddenly dawned on these geniuses that they had started something they couldn't finish, not unlike a twenty-pound burrito. The kid really was prepared to die for the sake of his dignity. Unless they were willing to go to that end and actually *kill* this kid, the *could not* win this fight. Eventually, the three of them picked the kid up, carried him back to the hill, and threw him over. The second his sinewy frame left their hands, all three of them came scrambling toward the Jeep, scared that they wouldn't make it back before the runt clawed his way up the slope and began his next charge.  
 

All of them fell inside, as though they were trying to escape some terrible onslaught. The driver revved the engine and peeled out. As we sped away from the scene, I looked back over my shoulder. I saw the kid come over the top of the hill in all of his hundred-and-twenty pound glory, and a chill went down my spine. His face was bloody, and his button-down shirt was torn and grass-stained, but there wasn't a trace of emotion on his face. Instead of running for the police, the kid dusted himself off, put his glasses back on, and then headed casually off, I assume, to Gryffindor or Hogwarts or wherever, hugging his books in his arms. Right then, I realized that not only was that kid the coolest guy in the world, he was the toughest son of a bitch ever to walk the face of this earth."	t5_2qhj4	True
