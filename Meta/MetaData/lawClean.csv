1344182643.0	xpuoc	Want a job? Try this. 	MenorahMan	905	184	248	"After my last post, I received a lot of PMs. Most were death threats because I dared mention that someone from a bottom law school was able to succeed, but others were legitimate questions about how I did. Here's my tips. I PROMISE these work. For everyone. Especially number 4. 

1) Make business cards for yourself. Vistaprint makes like 1000 for five bucks. 

2) Attend every single event your school has that you have even a slight interest in. Stay after, meet the speakers, get their cards. 

3) Offer to help set up these events! Two of my job offers came from people I originally met by scheduling them to speak at my school. 

4) Make an excel sheet numbered 1-100. Go to your school, google, whatever, and find some attorneys in the current field you are interested in. Email every single one of them. Every one. Simply ask if you can buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain. Of the 50 or so times I did this, only 3 said no. 2 never got back. It works. 

At these small interviews, make sure they don't last more than 15 minutes (unless you're KILLING it). Ask them how they got where they are. What classes they think you should take. Any advice in general. Feel free to ask them things like, ""was it worth it?"" or ""do you like it?"" Then finally, ask them for a referral of others you should speak with. 

Full that excel sheet 1-100. I promise you'll find something promising before 50, and in most cases before 20. My father was in jail my whole life, my mother was absent, I have ZERO money, and I'm not a minority of any kind. I did this on my own. This works. 

Do it. Many here will say, ""Fuck you MenorahMan! This doesn't create jobs. This CAN'T work for everyone!""

Screw them. This actually DOES create jobs. One of my offers was a new position the CEO had been wanting to add and he felt I'd be good for it. Even if it doesn't for you, most students don't do any of this. I promise if you do, you will stand out.

For the uninitiated: to bolster her claim she presents a ""signed document"" promising not to pull it away. Acting on that he proceeds and, of course, she pulls it away anyway. While he's lying there she presents the document and says it wasn't notarized.

Now, obviously they're minors and we don't have any further details as to the document. But assuming that it's legally valid and binding, etc., it's my understanding that notarization only really validates signatures. If that's the case then it doesn't really matter if it was notarized since she claimed (or at least, implied) that she signed it.

So if that's the case, what kind of action could be taken against her? Would that count as assault at all?"	t5_2qh9k	True

1340892566.0	vqohp	Supreme Court UPHOLDS the individual mandate as a tax in the Affordable Care Act	MSkog	295	47	191	"Per SCOTUSBlog. Opinion by Roberts. [HERE IS THE OPINION](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf)

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English, per SCOTUSblog: 

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, a majority of the Court has accepted the Administration's backup argument that, as Roberts put it, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act. By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion, a quick look at pp. 31 and 32 of Roberts' opinion tells you why the Court is sustaining as a tax measure.

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government's power to terminate states' Medicaid funds is narrowly read.***

According to SCOTUSBlog, ""Chief Justice Roberts' vote saved the ACA."" So 5-4, with Kennedy...in the dissent?

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.***

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue, a majority of the Court holds that the Medicaid expansion is constitutional but that it w/b unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions.

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding."" (p. 55)

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues, having upheld the mandate 5-4.

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn't matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, for herself and Sotomayor, Breyer and Kagan, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent, Kennedy says: ""In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.""

**Commentary on Commerce Clause, Necessary &amp; Proper:**

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation, saying: 

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11, re: options under the law

&gt;Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the opinions collectively are a monster. The Chief's opinion is 59 pages, Justice Ginsburg's opinion is 61 pages, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders. We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions."""	t5_2qh9k	True

I'm in a niche practice that can be litigation intensive and recently wrapped up a case where opposing counsel was unproductively contentious and just stupid. I asked opposing counsel to settle numerous times, each which he vehemently denied and actually guaranteed he would prevail.

I filed and served my Summary Judgment motion and opposing counsel actually calls my office to argue the merits over the phone.  This is not a back-and-forth intellectual discourse - it's why I was 100% wrong and he was 100% right.  I told him to file an opposition instead of wasting time on the phone.  This moron then tells me ""there's no way you're going to win"" the Summary Judgment motion.

We had oral argument and the judge was tearing apart my adversary's opposition (or lack thereof) and absence of evidence.  My Summary Judgment was continued, unfortunately, due to a very technical discovery issue that would take about a week to resolve.  As the judge step down, this idiot, still on record, begins peppering the judge with how the Court would rule under numerous hypotheticals. This judge, famously patient and nice, explains that each such hypothetical question is inappropriate.  When the judge finally leaves the room, this moron gleefully remarks on how my Summary Judgment Motion was not granted and how he ""creamed"" me. 

A week turns into three months.  Opposing counsel writes numerous 4-page letters (10-pt, single spaced) to the judge (a) requesting adjournments of the Summary Judgment Motion, (b) characterizing me as wanting to delay this matter because of ""damning evidence"" he has discovered, (c) conditioning resolution of the discovery issue on something legally irrelevant and out of my control, and (d) babbling on public policy like a law school exam.  The judge grants the first two extensions (defendant did have very sympathetic facts) but denies the third request.  I don't like getting involved with ""correspondence duels"" and I am front of this judge all the time, so I hang back and let my adversary show his lack of experience with these letters.  Of course, he never supplements the record with his ""damning evidence.""

The Motion is for 11:00 AM and the judge comes out on the bench at 11:05 and my adversary isn't there, yet.  The judge explains that he tried calling my adversary with no response and that, if I had no objection, he would proceed to grant my Summary Judgment motion, which he would have done on the papers but for my adversary's request for oral argument.  Of course, I had no objection and the judge but his findings on the record. In the middle of this, opposing counsel tried entering the court room, but the Sheriff wouldn't let him as the judge was on the bench.  The hearing concludes, the judge leaves, and my adversary walks up to the defendant table thinking we're next.  The judge's secretary walks out with copies of the Order in my favor and he just can't believe it. He tries arguing the merits with me again in front of other attorneys, but I just point to the Order. He's livid, asks the secretary to get the judge for a re-hearing, and assures me that the judge will have to vacate the Order he just issued and that there's ""no way you can get away this."" The judge's secratary said there was no way the case would be heard. Opposing counsel asks the secretary what he should do. I laugh and the secretary responds ""Don't ask me, you're the lawyer.""

TrueWarrior	229	36	36	"Opposing counsel files a Motion to Dismiss because my client failed to satisfactorily provide responses to OPC's 250+ vague and ambiguous discovery request.  In my specific practice, all you need is about 20 discovery requests maximum to obtain all necessary evidence.

The judge has a status conference instead and advises OPC that 250 is way too many, that most of the requests were irrelevant, and that my client was right in taking so long to provide responses to this huge discovery request.  The judge continues the Motion for 4 weeks and advises OPC to reduce the number of requests, make those requests more specific, and serve them in 5 days.  Of course, the judge is giving OPC a chance to get better discovery and withdraw the Motion.

A few days later, we get 175 requests.  This was actually the original set, minus 75 requests and with the same ambiguous language!  We respond with our same 175 objections.

By way of background, OPC has some vehement grudge against me.  I'm not sure why as I always make an effort to be courteous to all parties.  OPC generally refuses me any courtesies (e.g., simple request to adjourn an unimportant hearing), tries to draw me into correspondence duels by trashing me in letters with the judge CC'ed, and is just rude to my office.

We are at the motion hearing he's so cocksure he'll prevail.  He opens on how lousy an attorney I am for providing the exact same responses to the second set of discovery.  The judge is getting impatient with this guy and explains that he served me the exact same questions and wasted his opportunity at meaningful discovery.  The judge then analytically shreds OPC's Motion before turning to me.  The entire hearing is in my favor at this point, so I lighten the tense mood by conceding that the judge just stole my thunder and I have nothing to add with my rebuttal.  The judge and the court staff have a laugh.  OPC is now clearly upset and starts repeating his argument about 10 decibels higher and ratchets his personal attacks on me.

The judge is extraordinarily frustrated with OPC at this point and beautifully adds this to the record:

**""What's wrong, OPC?  Did Mr. Truewarrior hurt your feelings?  I know you don't like Mr. Truewarrior based on your correspondences and phone calls to the court.  I'm sorry, get over Mr. Truewarrior.  I cannot litigate your hurt feelings.""**

The judge denies the Motion and OPC literally runs out of the courtroom.

I believe they're not.

This is a subreddit about the law, not the politics surrounding the law or scandals not involving legal actors. Since /r/lawyers came around it seems the quality of the posts here has gone significantly south. This is a problem for non-lawyers who have a legitimate interest in law, rather than people who inseparably equate law with politics and all the nonsense around it. 

I don't think we need AskScience level moderation, but more like TIL where misleading, off-topic, irrelevant, or misplaced posts are cleaned up in a hurry. We could maybe add seeking legal advice under this new policy.

There's no context. No knowledge of the actual situation. Obviously meant to be inflammatory. Most of all, the poster presents absolutely zero actual legal discussion.

Given these posts aren't terribly common it shouldn't be too much of a headache, but they have been showing up more than I'm really comfortable with. They're beginning to get annoying.

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the University’s investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's],"" wrote Justice Souter, ""[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. 

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent.

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the father’s name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the father’s registration. The mother listed Baby Girl’s ethnicity as “Hispanic” instead of “Native American” on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an “Indian Child” under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couple’s petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a “parent” under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the father’s consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define “parent” to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. 

* CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. 

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,""Indian, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6.""

**UTSW v. Nassar** 

* *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassar’s productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassar’s presence, “Middle Easterners are lazy.” In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keiser’s presence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassar’s productivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar applied for a promotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levine’s harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a position at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding positions to be filled by faculty doctors. In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back pay and compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to support the claim of constructive discharge.

* *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive, or does the provision require only proof that the employer had mixed motives for taking an action? 

[Oral Argument.](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_484)

Due to length constraints I will recommend checking out this [post](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2013/06/sole-motives-and-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar.html) on the subject. Eyer believes this might be one of the most important civil rights cases this year along Shelby. What does the role of mixed motives play in employee discrimination? No act has a single motivator and the Court is divided.

I filed a Motion to Disqualify the other attorney (long story).  It was set for hearing today.

Thirty minutes before the hearing, opposing counsel calls me on my cell phone and tells me that he has an ""interesting situation,"" that there is a fire across the street from father's house and his driveway is blocked by a fire truck and he can't make it to court.  Would I please agree to a continuance?

Fuck to the no.

So I mosey on down to court where the attorney reiterates his request for a continuance and asks for attorney fees because of my refusal of his ""reasonable request"" given the ""circumstances.""  I told the judge that I doubted the veracity of his client's statements.  Opposing counsel then pops up that he has proof, his client has texted him a picture of the fire truck.  I asked to see it, and it clearly shows a fire truck - parked ACROSS the street, with driveway clear.  Opposing makes an argument that the firemen would not let his client drive over the hoses or some bullshit.  I asked for a five-minute recess.

I went into the hallway and called the fire department and asked for dispatch.  I got the dispatcher on the line and asked if there had been a fire at that address today, and indeed there had been, but the crew was off the scene by 12:30 - a full thirty minutes before opposing counsel called me.

I returned to the courtroom and relayed this information to the judge, who suggested to opposing that he call his client and urge him to get to the courthouse RIGHT. NOW.

Now, knowing that the guy is a notorious alcoholic, and knowing that he was not intending to appear in court, I knew he would be drunk.  He currently has a suspended DL and a 3rd DUI (felony) pending.  So I go ask some of the bailiffs to stand next to the elevator and give them some identifying information, and ask them to tell me if they smell the odor of alcohol on him.

They do.  They relay this to me.

We conduct the hearing (now starting two hours late).  The judge takes it under advisement, but I know I've won.  By the end, the judge is cranky and it's after five and she wants to be done with it, but I put my ass on the line and risked getting ripped a new one and said, ""Judge, one more thing.  Upon information and belief of your bailiff based upon the odor of alcohol, Father is currently intoxicated.  I would request that this Court order that he immediately submit to a blood alcohol test.""

Opposing counsel goes apeshit.  ""This is harassment!  Blah! Blah!""

Judge grants my motion and orders Father to appear at a specific drug testing facility in thirty minutes.

Mother goes to the drug testing facility to pre-pay for the test because the order was made upon her request, and the grandmother sits in the courthouse parking lot watching Father's truck.

Father doesn't show up at the drug testing facility.  Mom waits around until it closes at 7.  He's a no show, so it's a presumed positive.

Instead, Father stands around until the courthouse clears, then gets in his truck once he thinks everyone is off his back.  Grandma follows him, calls the police department on suspicion of DUI, they pull him over, and arrest him for DUI and DUS.

You hear people often say the burden of proof rests entirely on the prosecution in our legal system. Yet, in this instance, it appears that no one actually *saw* the shooting in question. Yet, we do know for a fact that George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin. So, at this point, the defense necessarily *has* to prove that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, does it not? I understand the concept of Affirmative Defense, but people are saying that Florida's bill doesn't consider SYG as such. 

So my question is this:

What, at all, prevents someone from shooting an unnarmed person in the middle of nowhere with no witnesses (or at best, highly conflicting accounts of what happened) from claiming self-defense, and then clamming up in the courtroom, waiting for the prosecution to try and *prove* something in which the only other person who actually witnessed the events is dead? 

As I understand it, if there are conflicting stories/eye witnesses, then the tie is supposed to go to the accused. But that only makse sense if the question at hand is *if the person on trial actually committed the crime or not*. It would seem to be a similar situation if someone claims insanity. If they do not testify in their own defense, nor submit to a psychological evaluation, how is it possible to **prove** that they are not insane?

I'm just trying to understand the implications of such a law, if it is true that ""a judge will almost certainly dismiss this pre-trial"" as I've heard many say. "	t5_2qh9k	True

-------
**1) AMP v. Myriad (Thomas writes, 9-0)**

*The Court holds that natural isolated DNA is not patentable. Synthetic DNA is patentable.*

*The synthetic DNA (cDNA) is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.*

From the opinion: ""Myriad’s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception. Myriad’s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v.  Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new “with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature,” id., at 310. Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry.""

**2)  Tarrant Regional Water Dist. V. Herrmann. (Sotomayor writes, 9-0)**

(1) Whether Congress’s approval of an interstate water compact that grants the contracting states “equal rights” to certain surface water and – using language present in almost all such compacts— provides that the compact shall not “be deemed . . . to interfere” with each state’s “appropriation, use, and control of water . . . not inconsistent with its obligations under this Compact,” manifests unmistakably clear congressional consent to state laws that expressly burden interstate commerce in water; and (2) whether a provision of a congressionally approved multi-state compact that is designed to ensure an equal share of water among the contracting states preempts protectionist state laws that obstruct other states from accessing the water to which they are entitled by the compact.

*The Court rules that the compact does not preempt the state water laws of Oklahoma. This involves an interpretation of the Red River Compact.* 

*The Tenth Circuit is affirmed.*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-889_5ie6.pdf)

------

**3) US v. Davila (Ginsburg writes, vacated and remanded)**

This was a case in which the issue was whether there must be an automatic reversal if the judge played any role in the plea bargaining.
Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that any degree of judicial participation in plea negotiations, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), automatically requires vacatur of a defendant’s guilty plea, irrespective of whether the error prejudiced the defendant.

*Under the Federal Rules, vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davila's decision to plead guilty.*

*""Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 prohibits judges from participating in plea agreements, but another subsection of the rule also provides that a 'variance from the requirements' of Rule 11 is 'harmless if it does not affect substantial rights,' so this one did not come as a huge surprise.""- Amy Howe*

*The decision of the Eleventh Circuit is vacated and remanded.*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-167_d1oe.pdf)

**4) American Trucking v. LA. (Kagan writes, 9-0)**

Whether 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1), which provides that “a State [or] political subdivision . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property,” contains an unexpressed “market participant” exception and permits a municipal governmental entity to take action that conflicts with the express preemption clause, occurs in a market in which the municipal entity does not participate, and is unconnected with any interest in the efficient procurement of services.

*The Court holds that federal law expressly preempts the agreement- two provisions dealing with displays by trucks in the port with regards to placards and parking.*

*Ninth circuit is reversed.*

So, as I stated in the title, at the end of the month a delegation of law students from Iceland, including myself, will sit down with Justice Antonin Scalia (an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of USA) and discuss, well, pretty much want we want, I guess.

I've been thinking lately what exactly to ask, since I want to show up well prepared. Although he is an important figure in the US, he´s mostly out of the daily focus in Iceland. That's why I turn to you guys. If you had the chance to ask a Justice of the American Supreme Court any question, what question would it be?

Up to now, I've thought about the themes of abortion, Iraq-Afghanistan and death penalty. SOPA has also been mentioned. Got anything to add to that list? Any advice would be well received.

Edit: Thanks ever so much for all the comments, good people of r/law. There are some good questions here that might make it to my meeting with Justice Scalia (some definitely will!). I'm sorry if I gave the impression I was just slacking off and letting Reddit do all the work, I've been investigating this curious man over the last couple of days but still, it's marvelous getting good advise from those more familiar with the American society."	t5_2qh9k	True

Here is the TL;DR	Vogeltanz	136	34	66	"So, wrapping it all up into a neat, little package:
 
1.  The state charged Zimmerman with Murder 2, which means the state bears the burden of persuasion to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman (1) killed Martin, (2) with ill-will towards him, (3) and while acting in disregard for human life.
 
2.  Zimmerman is pleading justification, which requires evidence that Zimmerman used deadly force in the reasonable belief, under the circumstances, that Martin would cause him imminent death or bodily harm.
 
3.  If Zimmerman can produce enough evidence to permit a juror to reasonably find that Zimmerman acted with justification, then the state must not only prove all the elements of murder 2 beyond a reasonable doubt, the state must also prove that Zimmerman did not act in self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Or, stated another way, **if there is a reasonable doubt about whether Zimmerman acted in self defense, the jury must acquit.**

* * *
Edit 1:  Here is the snippet from my post specifically addressing the burden of persuasion for justification under Florida law:

* * *

This is the big question that's tripping most of the people up in /r/law:  **who has the burden of persuasion on whether Zimmerman was justified?**

The answer?  There is no answer, because that question is a red-herring.  As explained below, Zimmerman must only produce enough evidence of justification to allow a reasonable juror the *possibility* of believing his defense.  Once that minimal amount of evidence is produced, the jury must find Zimmerman not guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of whether Zimmerman was actually justified in the killing.  Stated another way, assuming Zimmerman can produce that minimal amount of evidence, the state bears the burden of persuasion to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. 

Huh?

Let me explain.  Dealing with affirmative defenses in criminal law is tricky.  Why?  Because, remember, the defendant carries with him the presumption of innocence unless the state can prove his guilt by proving each element of the offense.  From this simple, but very profound statement, we could easily go really deep into criminal law and due process and talk about defenses that negate an element of the offense, or simply provide an excuse to the offense.  But, luckily, it's not necessary here because the Florida courts have already ruled on this exact issue:  

**if a defendant on trial for Murder 2 can raise enough evidence that a reasonable juror might believe he acted in justifiable self-defense, then the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.**    [*Mosansky v. Florida*, 33 So. 3d 756 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. 2010)](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1520091.html); [*see also Montijo v. Florida*, _So. 2d_ No. 5D09-3434 (Fla. 5th Dist. Ct. 2011)](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1563649.html).

From *Montijo*:  ""When a defendant claims self-defense, the State maintains the burden of proving the defendant committed the crime and did not act in self-defense.""

And a more thorough explanation from *Mosansky*:  ""[I]n a criminal prosecution the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt never shifts from the state and, as a result, when self-defense is properly at issue, the state effectively has the burden to prove that defendant was not acting in self-defense during the commission of the criminal act.""

For those interested, the minimum amount of evidence that Zimmerman must produce to force the jury instruction on self-defense is called his ""burden of production.""  He must ""produce"" that minimum level of evidence.  Once produced, the state bears the burden of persuasion to prove that Zimmerman did not act in self-defense!

* * *
Edit 2:  FWIW, based on the evidence and probable cause affidavit we've seen, I think the state will have a very, very difficult time winning a conviction.  Both as to the ""ill-will"" element of Murder 2, and overcoming justification.

Details: **Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.**

As part of an effort to increase voter registration and turnout, in 1993 Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act.  The Act requires states to “accept and use” a specific federal form for voter registration; that form asks, among other things, whether the would-be voter is a citizen of the United States and over the age of eighteen.  In 2004, Arizona voters approved a law that requires election officials in that state to refuse to register any would-be voter who cannot prove that he is in fact a citizen.  Arizona residents, along with voting and civil rights groups, challenged the state law, arguing that it could not stand because it conflicted with, and was trumped by, the NVRA.  The challengers won in the lower court, and the Supreme Court granted review last fall to consider not only whether the state law can survive, but also whether the lower court used the right test in making its decision:  that court held that because the Constitution allows Congress to make or change election rules established by the states, Congress can veto any state laws relating to elections, even if it doesn’t make clear that it intends to do so.

Today the Court held, in a seven-to-two decision by Justice Scalia, that Arizona’s law cannot stand in the face of the NVRA. The Court first recognized that under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to dictate when, where, and how elections are held, and state election laws that conflict with federal ones are therefore preempted and without effect. The Court thus held that by requiring states to “accept and use” the federal form, the NVRA effectively required the states to treat the federal form as sufficient evidence of citizenship without any additional proof, so that Arizona’s proof-of-citizenship requirement was contrary to the NVRA, and therefore invalid.  The Court recognized that the words “accept and use” do not necessarily carry such a broad meaning – they could mean only that the state was required to consider the federal form – but based on the context and the other provisions in the NVRA, the Court concluded that the requirement to “accept and use” the federal form has the stronger effect of requiring states to treat the federal form as sufficient. On the question of which legal test to apply, the Court made it clear that while preemption under the Supremacy Clause (which provides that federal law generally trumps contrary state law) requires Congress to clearly state its intent to preempt state requirements, preemption under the Elections Clause is more easily found because federal elections law will alwaysdisplace state law.

Finally, the Court held that in the future, Arizona can ask the federal Election Assistance Commission, which creates the federal form, to include a requirement of additional proof of citizenship in the form, and to bring different legal challenges if the EAC refuses to do so.

Justice Kennedy drafted a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment; Justices Thomas and Alito each filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that Arizona’s requirement should not have been held preempted.

**Salinas v. Texas.**  

Texas CCA affirmed.  Issue: Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant’s refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.  Alito opinion says the defendant did not expressly invoke his 5th Amendment rights so the prosecutor can comment on this silence to police questioning.

Details: **FTC v. Actavis**
This case is an antitrust challenge to an increasingly common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name companies faced with generic competition pay the would-be competitor an amount of money to stay out of the market.  The payment comes in the form of settling a dispute over the validity or infringement of the brand-name company’s patent.  Because generic entry reduces drug prices, these “pay for delay” or “reverse payment” agreements are alleged to reduce competition and increase drug costs.  The Federal Trade Commission sued drug companies over one such deal.  The court of appeals rejected that claim, explaining that the brand name’s patent includes the right to exclude competitors.

Today, by a vote of five to three, the Supreme Court reversed and held that the claim can go forward.  Justice Breyer wrote the Court’s opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas.  Justice Alito was recused from the case.

The Court held that the government and private parties may seek to prove that these payments violate the antitrust laws.  It refused, however, to hold them presumptively illegal.  The ruling is likely to essentially put an end to such payments in the future.  Litigation over previous deals will continue in the lower courts.

Details: **Maracich v. Spears**
A federal law, the Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), prohibits the use of a driver’s information from a state DMV without prior permission from the driver.  In this case, lawyers sued South Carolina car dealers on behalf of four individuals who had recently bought cars, alleging that the car dealers had violated a state consumer protection law.  Using contact information from the South Carolina DMV, they then tried to find additional plaintiffs for their lawsuits so that they could form a class action lawsuit.  However, lawyers for the car dealers then filed a lawsuit on behalf of other South Carolinians who had recently bought cars, alleging that the use of the information from the DMV violated the DPPA.  At issue before the Court was whether the original lawsuit against the car dealers was allowed under a provision of the DPPA that creates a “litigation exception” to the law’s general ban on use of driver data; that “exception” allows the use of driver data “in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any Federal, State, or local court . . . including . . . investigation in anticipation of litigation.”

Writing for a five-Justice majority, Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court held that the litigation exception does not apply to attorney solicitations of potential clients using DMV data.   Because the statute generally protects highly sensitive information, any exception should be read narrowly, the Court held.  The reference to an “investigation in anticipation” extends only to activities to decide whether a potential claim has sufficient merit to warrant a lawsuit, or to locate witnesses, but not activities designed to sign up clients for a case.

The Court remanded the case for the lower courts to decide whether, viewed objectively, the “predominant purpose” of the use of the DMV information was for client solicitation (in which case it was illegal) or for some other permissible litigation-related purposes (in which case it was legal).

Joining Justice Kennedy’s opinion were the Chief Justice, along with Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito.  Justices Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

**ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES.**  

Issue: Whether this Court’s decision in Harris v. United States, holding that the Constitution does not require facts which increase a mandatory minimum sentence to be determined by a jury, should be overruled.  

Held: Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “element” that must be submitted to the jury.  Thomas went with majority.  He is into juries deciding things at least.

Harry_B_C_Dresden	115	18	75	"I'm giving a presentation later this week to a group of new associates on how to deal with opposing attorneys who are bullies, assholes, or perverts.  Does /r/law have any good advice, stories, or sources for material? 

**Update:** Thanks for all the great suggestions.  The presentation went well and we discussed several of the topics raised in the comments.  I'll add one more suggestion. Beware of the passive aggressive bully.  The passive aggressive bully is the opposing counsel who says he's trying to help you avoid malpractice and ethics violations, but is really trying to scare you into doing what he wants (e.g., dismissing claims or defenses, not asking certain question at a deposition, settling, etc.).  For example, this bully takes you aside and tells you he's concerned that your making a pretty big mistake and he just wants to help or ""mentor"" you.  My advice is to listen politely and then run his ""advice"" by someone you trust ASAP.  During my first year as an attorney, I had a couple of sleepless nights because the OC, who had a good reputation in the Bar, took me aside after a deposition and told me that my defenses were borderline unethical.  I didn't have the knowledge or experience to know whether he was right, but because of his reputation, I was worried.  I explained the situation to a partner at my firm who I respected and she told me he was full of shit.  We ultimately obtained a great settlement, based in part, on the defenses OC told me were borderline unethical.  Bottom line, if you're unsure, talk to someone you respect."	t5_2qh9k	True

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the “supervisor” liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim’s daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to “hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline” their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.'

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held – in clear conflict with this Court’s decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group – that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf)

* First Circuit Reversed 

* Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. 

-----

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-418_7k8b.pdf)

* The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

----

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Court’s decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austin’s use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuit’s judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  University’s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. 

* Eugene Volokh asks the big question of the day: ""Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?"" Some back and forth obviously occurred between the justices.""

* The NYT has their [analysis/blog](http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/2013-06-supreme-court-decisions?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;WT.z_sma=US_LAO_20130624) up on the decision.

* Ilya Somin has some analysis on the decision over at [the Volokh blog](http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/24/preliminary-thoughts-on-fisher-v-university-of-texas/). 

-----

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

* Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) 

-----

Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. 

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

I'm curious to know what others think about this. Here's the link on the video Setting aside outrage for a moment, was the judge's complete refusal to watch the video the right call legally? A few specific thoughts I had:

1. Does the fact that this was a bench trial change anything in terms of how strict the Federal Rules of Evidence should be applied?
2. Is video from a police cruiser more reliable than other video evidence, especially when used against an officer for criminal matters?
3. Why weren't other authentication avenues explored? This could potentially fall into the business record exception to hearsay, or perhaps even the catchall via Rule 807. In the very least, why didn't the judge take the video into consideration while remembering the authentication concerns, and judge it accordingly?"	t5_2qh9k	True

1366752630.0	1cypl6	Proposition: UK banks blocking transfers to Bitcoin exchanges is illegal and in violation of UK Competition Law	matt608	106	21	59	"I've posted this in r/Bitcoin and got a great response, but being the wrong breed of nerd (tech nerd vs legal nerd) we need the help of r/law to find out the truth of the matter!

**What is bitcoin?**
For those of you who don't know Bitcoin is: Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency that uses an algorithm to generate bitcoins at a steady rate.  It's basically web-cash.


Banks don't like it because it allows people to send money to each other (bitcoins) without banks.  It's competition to banks, which currently have a monopoly on money transfer.


**What did the banks do to bitcoin exchanges?**
Banks, especially UK banks, have been shutting down the bank accounts of bitcoin exchanges.  To get bitcoins, you have to send money from your bank account to an exchange, then once you have the bitcoins you can send them to anyone around the world anytime, without using a bank and trade them for goods and services.


**Proposition: UK banks blocking transfers to Bitcoin exchanges is illegal and in violation of UK Competition Law:**


From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_competition_law#European_Union_law

""Like all competition law, that in the UK has three main tasks.

 - **Prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business entities.** This includes in particular the repression of cartels.
 - **Banning abusive behaviour by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position**. Practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing, tying, price gouging, refusal to deal and many others.""


I know very little about the details of the law (specifically UK law) but isn't this exactly what the banks are doing? (And this is not just happening in the UK) They are defending a monopoly that should never have been allowed to exist!


Examples of this happening:
 - Mtgox, the biggest bitcoin exchange had their bank account in the UK closed.

 - Today transferwise has just been banned from sending money to Bitstamp: http://transferwise.com/blog/2013-04/notice-to-bitcoin-users-april-2013  Bitstamp is a major bitcoin exchange and transferwise allowed UK citizens to send GBP to Bitstamp at a good rate.  Now they can still do it but with a SEPA transfer, which in the UK has an great big fee (e.g. £15 for barclays) plus a very expensive exchange rate.  

 - Bitfloor, another bitcoin exchange closed due to their bank account being closed. 

Can someone provide a watertight argument for why the banks refusing transfers to Bitcoin exchanges and closing accounts of bitcoin exchanges is illegal?
Can we take the banks to court over this? (or something that will prevent from doing this)"	t5_2qh9k	True

1337260715.0	trlfw	AMA I am now a licensed attorney who was convicted of plagiarism in law school AMA	Crumpledupthrownaway	102	18	94	"Here is the basic story:

**Background:**

To earn my final credit for law school, I submitted a paper for which I was found guilty of having committed plagiarism.  That is an entire story in its own right, but is unimportant for this thread.  I finally finished law school after a one semester suspension.  The earliest I could have taken the Bar was in July of that year, but I was moving and dealing with many things, and I had been warned that the time between the conviction and application to take the bar was important.  My application for the Bar in my home state was (and is) still pending, but I applied to take the February Bar in my new state.

**Process:**

The application was due in November and I disclosed as much as I possibly could.  There was a 500 word limit so I called the Bar to see if I could/should submit additional attachments.  I was told to wait and any additional requests would be sent later.  Then I waited.  I called my application analyst a number of times and she was really great, but she could tell me very little.  I heard nothing regarding the ethics issues and instead received my ""ticket"" to take the bar.  Although this was unexpected, the back of my mind entertained the idea that the rest of my application had been so impressive, that they had forgiven me for my flaws.  I studied for the Bar, took it, and passed.   Only, my name wasn't on the online list of those who had passed. When I received the letter informing me that I had passed the exam, it also stated: ""...our review of your application and supporting documentation has disclosed issues relating to your character and fitness to practice law which will need to be addressed.""

**Results**

Although I had expected it, I was still scared.  I contacted attorneys who specialized in representing other attorneys accused of malpractice and was eventually directed to an attorney who specializes in representing people in my exact situation.  I set up an initial consultation with him which cost me $500.00.  I then went to work for myself and gathered the following:

1. Additional reference letters.  I collected these from prior supervisors, friends in admirable places (doctors, other lawyers, etc.) and people who had participated with me in other organizations.

2. In the intervening year and a half since I graduated, I have written to every single law school in my state and offered to speak about the ""Perils of Plagiarism.""  Only one school has taken me up on the offer so far, but  I have offered again.  I collected copies of my offer letters.  I also asked the Professor from the school where I gave a speech to write a letter for me.  

3. When I was tried before the law school's Honor Council, I had hired an attorney to represent me.  As a broke law school student, by ""hired"" I mean, ""asked a friend who had been an attorney for 3 years"".  I asked him to write a letter as the school has not been helpful.  He wrote a letter that helped show my mindset at the time and give a bit more of ""my side"" of the story.

I then had my initial consultation.  By this time, I had received a letter from the bar providing a panel date and location.  My attorney explained the process to me which was very helpful.  First, there is an ethics panel of a small contingent (in this case, 3) of  the Board of Examiners.  At the panel, I'd be given about 30 minutes to talk about what happened and answer questions.  The panel would decide whether I was approved, denied, needed to provide further information, or they would assign me to a hearing.  If I was denied, I could request a hearing as well.  The hearing would be in front of the entire board, would be very similar to a trial (witnesses, discovery, a prosecutor, the whole nine-yards).  My attorney also told me that he did not think my chances were very good at the panel level.  In fact, he said that he thought it would be a waste of my money to pay him to attend the panel with me and advised me that I should save my money for the full blown hearing, which he advised would cost me between $10K and $15K.  As  there is NO way that I could have paid for his representation at the hearing, I knew that I had to do whatever I could to pass at the panel.  So, I paid the attorney $500 for 2 more hours of his time to strategize and discuss before the panel.  Although I am not sure the attorney's advice actually changed anything that I did, I am very glad that I paid him because it made me feel more prepared for the panel.

I went to the panel with a sense of calm.  There was nothing more I could do.  I handed them the information I had collected (I had made five sets, each color coded and organized in the most professional folders I could find).  They asked me a number of questions regarding the timeline of events and a few other details.  I told them about the packet I created for them.  I did not hide anything and, as painful as it was to discuss, I told them everything I could.  I was given five minutes for a ""closing argument."" My attorney had suggested that I use this time to draw their attention to my recommendation letters, but that had already been covered.  So I told them simply that what had happened, happened.  If I could change it, I would, but clearly that wasn't possible.  Instead, I was doing everything I could to make up for what had happened, including giving speeches  to fresh law school students.  Additionally, I am now hyper diligent, following up on all deadlines, having my things reviewed, and telling people, if necessary, that I just cannot handle another task.  

After I left, I told my attorney the members of the panel.  He told me that it was a long shot, but that I had the best panel for which I could have possibly hoped.  A week later, the Bar mailed me a letter telling me that I had been approved and that my license was in  the mail.  I had not expected it, but I am so relieved after the entire ordeal.  

The story is quite long, but I tried to keep it to the essentials.  If you have any questions, I will happily answer them.

**TL; DR:** I overcame a pretty big ethical issue and figured I'd share the process for the curious.

One of the trainees in the office is having his room renovated, and as such has to share with one of the partners in their super offices for a week or so until his room is finished. This partner is my boss, and I warned the trainee that he could be a little bit quick-tempered and prickly, but it shouldn't be a problem as he'd only be with him for a couple of days.

So, the move happened, and Trainee went and sat beside Partner, plugging his phone into the VOIP system so that he could quietly shadow his phone calls whilst taking notes. The ICT monkey was in there as well doing stuff to the server (which is stored in Partner's room)

As he had been warned, Partners mood went from tepid to foul within 4 phone calls. Every person that he hung up from was a nonce, every problem stupid and caused by the person who had made the call. Trainee is one of those people hellbent on being happy, and kept making quips and observations to lighten the mood. He had noticed a single photograph adorning his wall, and after a particularly bad phone call, he pointed to it and said:

""Hey mate, what's this picture of? Is it you dressed in drag?"" 

As soon as he spoke the words he knew how utterly wrong he was. It was obviously not Partner now that he'd looked at it for more than 2 seconds. It was obviously just a slightly blokish looking woman. 

Partner stopped his rant-mid sentance. After about 15 seconds, he looked at the picture and coldly replied.

""Actually, that's my Fiancee.""

ICT Monkey knew that was Partner's fiancee and was silently gagging with laughter and the ****storm Trainee had brought on himself. Then, in an attempt to make it better, Trainee looked at it for a few seconds and stammered the follow-up

""N-No, that's impossible. It can't be a woman."" 

Trainee was removed from Partner's office and is now doing his work in with the Secretaries, who all hate him for putting Partner on the warpath. He hasn't got a phone or computer in there as nothing is spare, so he's just doing what he can by hand."	t5_2qh9k	True

*The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people*

Basically, if my interpretation is correct: The 9th Amendment explicitly protects all rights that are not enumerated in the Bill of Rights/US Constitution and was part of an effort to avoid specifically enumerating every single thing the People want protected (because that gets clumsy).

In fact, the 9th Amendment seems to stem from an early conflict with the *need* for a Bill of Rights because the Founders believed that such a document would only protect a few specific Rights while not protecting any other ones.

In retrospect: what does the 9th Amendment actually protect?

If the 4th Amendment doesn't protect the right to *privacy*, can the People of the US cite the 9th as protecting that right?  What of the right to things like internet access and healthcare?

1374412081.0	1iqyeg	New Legal Research Tool	pabloLA	89	13	73	"A prototype of a legal research engine I built is available, for free with no sign-up required, at www.wellsettled.com.  

The engine has two search modes:

**Case Holdings**
Leading legal search companies employ armies of attorneys to read judicial opinions and generate written summaries of them. At the same time however, judges (and their clerks) are also reading and summarizing prior decisions.  Specifically, when citing to an earlier decision, judges will often include a parenthetical that concisely conveys the legal substance of the decision. To date, these judge-generated case summaries tucked away in parentheticals have been grossly underutilized. The wellsettled.com engine seeks to change that by enabling users to run queries against, and only against, these summaries. 

**Unequivocal Articulations of Legal Principles**

Occasionally a court will issue a written opinion containing an unequivocal articulation of a legal principle. If the common law were a biological genome, these articulations would be the “genes”. Luckily, these ""legal genes"" are frequently introduced by specific phrases, the most prevalent of which are ”It is well settled that…”  and “It is well established that…”
Leveraging this convention, the wellsettled.com engine allows users to run queries against, and only against, concise articulations of law.


The engine does not link to full-text opinions and can only supplement, not replace, full-fledged legal research engines. Functionality at this very early stage is rather spartan, and there are no doubt some glitches. I would welcome feedback on all the ways it can be improved. "	t5_2qh9k	True

1335377369.0	ss3vg	"A thread about our collective fear of ""giving legal advice"" on /r/law"	Vogeltanz	87	16	98	"I would like to share a few thoughts I've been having about redditors who ask specific legal questions pertaining to their lives, and /r/law's general (and often shrill) response of ""we don't give legal advice!!""

I don't think offering an opinion or guidance to someone on this forum, based in law, violates any of our respective rules of professional conduct.  Clearly the people in this forum are not our clients.  Are they ""prospective clients""?  I think not.  Both ABA Model Rule 1.18 and my own rule 1.18 here in Louisiana define ""prospective client"" as ""[a] person who discusses with a lawyer the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter.""  There might be exceptions of course, but I haven't yet seen a person on /r/law that appears to be soliciting representation from a lawyer.  Instead, what I see is people asking for legal insight, guidance or advice on a given issue separate and apart from a desire to hire an attorney.

What about Rules 4.1 through 4.3?  While those rules deal with making truthful statements to third-parties and unrepresented parties, each rule applies only to conduct that arises during the course of representing a client.  In other words, on their face, these rules do not apply if the statements are not made to a third-party on behalf of an actual client (which, we've already established, does not typically exist on /r/law).

**So, my question to my fellow attorneys is this:**  what rule of ethics or judicial opinion can you cite for the proposition that giving legal guidance to a person on /r/law -- who is not actually or even apparently seeking to retain representation -- in unethical?  I say it's not unethical.

Moreover, I find it laudable that an attorney on /r/law would share his/her legal expertise for free to those who are curious of the law or need guidance.  So long as it is clear that neither the OP is seeking legal representation, nor that the attorney is accepting such representation -- I don't think there's any ethical issue.

Lastly, I have four quick, final thoughts:

1.  If the reason that an attorney doesn't want to give legal advice is because either (a) the attorney just doesn't want to, or (b) the rules /r/law has adopted prevents it, then that's fine.  But use that as your excuse -- not that it's unethical.

2.  I am completely open to changing my mind on this.  If anyone has an advisory opinion, ethics rule, or judicial opinion on point, please share for all our benefits.

3.  In re: the unauthorized practice of law -- I'm not sure this applies either given that there is no attorney-client relationship.  But, assuming you base your reasoning on the law of your jurisdiction -- and you give that disclaimer to the OP -- I don't think it applies if the OP is located out of your jurisdiction.  By analogy, if a person chatted you up in your hometown restaurant about a legal problem in another state, you could obviously give general legal advice and not be practicing unauthorized law vis-a-vis the out-of-state jurisdiction.  I find posting on /r/law no different.

4.  As a general comment, ethics issues are all about the fine line between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.  Everyone knows you can't co-mingle client money with your own.  Most attorneys aren't getting in trouble for that.  The real rub is issues like this -- potentially close calls that have big ramifications for honest people.  If giving legal advice on /r/law is unethical, we shouldn't do it.  But if it is unethical, I'd argue that we have at least a moral duty to share our legal expertise with those who need a little guidance.

Thanks!

* * *

**CONCLUDING EDIT:**  To summarize the thread, I read the following thoughts:

(1).  Some posters don't want to offer legal guidance to redditors simply because they don't want that to be the focus of /r/law, regardless of any ethical or malpractice issue.  That's reasonable enough, in my opinion, though I'd still like to know the answer to the more substantive legal/ethical issue Internet-based advice raises.

(2).  A majority of posters think that offering guidance opens them up to an unacceptable amount of risk for either (a) ethical violations, including the UPL or (b) malpractice.

To quickly respond -- **malpractice** is only an issue if there is an attorney-client relationship.  EncyclopediaBrown has a good citation to the Restatements on point.  An A/C relationship might be established if the redditor **manifests to a lawyer** the person's intent that **the lawyer** provide legal services for the person.  But a redditor who posts a question to a forum (and not via PM to a specific person) is not manifesting an intent to hire any **particular** person.  At least under that definition, a one-off comment in response to a redditor's comment could not likely meet the definition above.  

Of course, that's just one particular argument for malpractice.  I just have not read any comment below that impresses me on the malpractice issue on either a legal or practical basis.  No citations either.  Though, to EncyclopediaBrown, I'd actually be very interested to read a case or two about the radio call-in shows you mentioned.  That sounds very on point.

What about **UPL**?  Again, no citations from the group.  But the question (at least how it's framed here in Louisiana) is whether you're offering ""legal services **in violation of the regulation** of the legal profession in that jurisdiction?""  Again, in Louisiana, we have very broad definition of ""legal services.""  To wit:

""(1) holding  oneself  out  as  an  attorney or lawyer authorized to practice law; or (2) rendering legal consultation or advice to a client [or a bunch of more specific stuff].""  So, here's the real question:  is rendering legal advice to a pseudonymous person on the Internet a violation of any state bar rules?  I don't know the answer to that question.  Any thoughts?  Any advisory opinions out there?

Absent the malpractice and UPL issues, I don't read any comments below that raise other ethical concerns absent an attorney-client or prospective client relationship (and I think the cited ethics rules on point pretty well flesh out that there's little chance of an A/C relationship being formed).  And, in response to PainfullyBlunt in re confidentiality, I'm not impressed.  Confidentiality requires an A/C or Prospective A/C relationship.  I've seen no good arguments on how that relationship might be formed when a pseudonymous person posts to a general forum on the Internet, and there's no follow-up agreement (or appearance of agreement) on representation.  I feel pretty entrenched in this position.  I'll need to see case law to the contrary.

(3).  DownandOutinParis wants everyone to know that he's a French lawyer, dammit!  Tres bien, mon ami!

(4).  Thanks very much to Mr_Academic for his link to [the ABA compilation of each state's definition of the practice of law.](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf)  Tres bien!

(5).  I really like the idea of adding a jurisdictional tag and a ""I'm a lawyer"" or ""IANAL"" tag to each user's name (that wants it).  I've been thinking about doing this over in /r/lawfirm for the past month.  (yes, that was a shameless plug for /r/lawfirm)"	t5_2qh9k	True

What am I doing wrong?	attythrowaway	83	16	155	"I'm writing because I feel I am completely out of ideas and am in need of some brutally honest advice. I graduated in Spring 2010 with a law degree from a mid-ranked university. I then moved out of state to New York, which perhaps was my first mistake, as I had not attended an ""in-state"" law school. My law-school grades were OK (3.09 GPA), and I did have the opportunity to intern at a law firm one summer and a legal clinic the following fall. However, I didn't do a clerkship or sit on law review.

After the move I continually applied for jobs, legal and non-legal. I volunteered for a few months then sat for the NY State Bar in February '11. I passed on my first try. While I did land a few jobs to help me pay the bills, none of them were law-related. Now that I have finally been admitted to the NY state bar earlier this year, I am itching to get into a firm somewhere and start working my way up. 

I'm currently working as a volunteer attorney, but I can tell this position isn't going to lead to anything. Unfortunately, no one else has given me a chance yet. I've had a total of 2 interviews for legal jobs, both of which were pretty embarrassing. I have no courtroom experience. I know quite a bit about immigration law but don't speak another language fluently. I'm not an expert in any other field of law, but I'm confident that if someone hired me, I would be ""up to speed"" within a week. It's just getting that chance to prove myself hasn't come yet.

There were several reasons I didn't apply myself in school as much as I should have - health reasons (severe IBS), uncertainty as to what I wanted to do after law school, and little to no guidance from my career advisors. Nevertheless, I know that I am somehow to blame for much of this, that I'm ultimately responsible for my actions. I must be doing something incredibly wrong in my career search. I'm writing here in the hopes that someone wiser than me can shed some light on my situation. Am I going about this all wrong? Should I go to a less competitive job market? Did I ""mess up"" law school and am now sitting on several years of wasted time? Should I get my LLM? Feel free to ask or tell me anything.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice, even those who had generally negative things to say, as I did ask for brutal honesty. I'm going to take the weekend to think on all of this, as it's clear that I'm going to need to make some major life changes in the next few months. As a few other posters have mentioned, my move to New York was also motivated by love, which makes relocation an even more difficult option. Lot of hard decisions to make, but at least I have all the information now. Thanks again."	t5_2qh9k	True

Synopsis from [Volokh Conspiracy](http://www.volokh.com/2012/12/21/can-a-police-officer-lawfully-pull-over-a-car-for-a-traffic-violation-based-on-an-erroneous-understanding-of-the-traffic-laws/):

&gt;An officer spotted a car with a broken rear right brake light. The officer pulled over the car, and the traffic stop eventually led to the discovery of drugs in the car. The defendant was convicted, and on appeal persuaded the North Carolina Court of Appeals to adopt a rather surprising interpretation of the traffic laws. According to [a long statutory analysis from the North Carolina Court of Appeals](http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=2&amp;xmldoc=In%20NCCO%2020110816606.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR&amp;SizeDisp=7), interpreting several archaic sections of the traffic code, it was actually **legal** to have one broken brake light as long as the other brake light functioned properly. The state government saw the opportunity: It accepted this interpretation of the statutes, and it petitioned the North Carolina Supreme Court only on the Fourth Amendment question of whether the stop was constitutionally reasonable even though it turned out that the officer’s belief that a broken tail light was unlawful was not correct.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina [ruled by a vote of 4-3](http://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=1&amp;pdf=MjAxMi8zODBQQTExLTEucGRm) that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to execute a seizure based on a reasonable mistake of law.  However, when a civilian makes a reasonable mistake of law the rule is that's no excuse.  IANAL so the mental gymnastics that must have been performed to generate this ruling are beyond me.  Could anyone help me out?

Also, what is preventing North Carolina's law enforcement agencies from slashing their training budgets in the light of this ruling's ""it's okay for officers to pull you over even if you aren't breaking the law"" take on the Fourth Amendment?"	t5_2qh9k	True

If you're a solo or small-firm attorney, or if you're thinking about going solo, please read over our plan and think about signing-up.  It’s time to make the Solo relevant!	Vogeltanz	76	14	17	"Hi everyone.  First things first:  please don't troll the solo/small-firm practice in this thread.  If you're aren't interested in solo/small-firm work, that's cool.  Feel free to read or not read, but there's no need to troll our project or our profession in this thread.

* * *

**WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?**

So, here's the deal: we started /r/lawfirm about three months ago specifically to provide support for solo/small-firm attorneys (""SSFers"").  We're trying to provide the same level of support you'd get at a big firm, and maybe something even better using a crowd-sourcing model of Reddit attorneys.  We have some very big projects in the works, the first of which is the ""Referral Network.""  Here's the link (which contains the overal plan, phases of implementation, and how you can join):  http://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/t716x/the_great_referral_network_project_please_read/

* * *

**MORE SPECIFICALLY . . .**

The idea is this:  grow a list of Reddit-based SSFers by jurisdiction, subject-matter expertise, and years of experience.  Begin to personally network within your jurisdiction with your newfound colleagues.  Maintain a record-based system of referrals and outcomes.

The goals are two-fold:  (1) if an SSFer gets a client and the lawyer needs help with either the subject matter or handling the actual litigation/engagement, they can solicit other SSFers to sign onto the litigation for a fixed/hourly/contingency fee.  Not an ""employee"" relationship.  A contractor relationship.  (2) if an SSFer gets a client that they aren't interested in taking, they can refer the client out to another lawyer on the SSF list.

Why is this important?  A BIG reason that young attorneys fear going solo is (1) cost to hang the shingle, and (2) a fear of failing because of inexperience.  We're designing a project to address the first point, and the Referral Network addresses the second.  If you get an employee-discrimination client and you've never litigated an ED case in Federal Court, just look up a fellow SSFer on the list and approach them for either some free advice (we're a very giving group of lawyers) or to sign on to the litigation for a fee so you can learn the ropes!  It's just that easy.

Or, you do transactional work but a buddy is asking for a DWI referral?  Great!  Send that potential client to your newfound colleague on the SSF list.  Or, same situation, maybe you get a PI inquiry?  Refer the case out and *split the fee* and *split the work* with an SSFer who does PI full time.  And, at the same time, you're learning a new field of law.

Right now, /r/LawFirm is small but we're trying to grow.  We have about 12 attorneys signed up to Phase 1 of the Referral Network at the moment.  I'd love for you to sign up too if you're interested.  If so, please sign up in the comments section **of the original post linked above.**  Feel free to PM with any questions.

* * *

**THE REFERRAL NETWORK IS JUST THE FIRST PROJECT**

Interested in our other projects?  We're doing a start-up guide for creating your own **paperless** law firm -- from nothing to an honest-to-goodness shop, webpage, support services, marketing, etc.  And -- FYI -- going paperless means going cheap and lean.  I'm only interested in solo's setting up shop for less than $1,000/mo overhead (malpractice and health-insurance included).

And, of course, the big big project that dovetails with the referral-network:  creating a space for attorneys to share work product and workflows among each other to build knowledge expertise.  Like a members-only wikipedia for lawyers on the substantive and procedural practice of law, broken down by jurisdiction and practice area.

Again, /r/lawfirm is about creating a meaningful support network for SSFers the kind of which they'd get a big law firm.  And, just maybe, something superior to even that.

* * *

**TL;DR**  /r/LawFirm is creating a referral-network to help Solo/Small-Firm lawyers get paying work, paying clients, life connections in their jurisdiction, and overal improve their quality of work-life.  Read all about it and sign-up if you're interested here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/t716x/the_great_referral_network_project_please_read/

1370379817.0	1fodss	How many years should I wait for employment as a lawyer?	law_r	75	13	140	"tl,dr: Lawyer since 2009, no full-time regular job since 2006, unable to get any interviews since 2010, no easy solution. Also, QQ. 

I worked for five years in a corporate setting, and topped out on promotion potential for people without an advanced degree. I enrolled in law school in 2006 thinking it would make me more marketable. I worked summers at a medium sized firm after my 1L and 2L years, and there was every indication they would welcome me back after graduation as a full time employee. 

I graduated law school and was sworn in as an attorney in 2009. I'd kept in touch with my would-be employer, and in October they kindly let me know the job they had for me was no longer available. I scrambled, I was lucky enough to get a paid internship working in a GC's office pushing paper. I did this for a year, until I was able to interview for the job I originally expected to have when I graduated from law school. 

My interview went fine, but not great. I learned that the employer was able to hire someone with 5 years of experience to the entry level position I interviewed for. The GC's office politely, but firmly, encouraged me to find work elsewhere about a month after I got my rejection letter from my original job prospect. 

Of course, I was crushed, but continued hustling and trying to find work. I opened a solo practice and took on cases in 2011 and 2012, while I continued to look for full time regular work. My case volume was low, but I did enough work to keep the lights on. I was just treading water, though, and it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. As such, I've been winding down my book of work while still looking for any full-time opportunity to work as an attorney. I recently wrapped up my last client matter, and am taking my shingle down. 

So far I've been unable to even score an interview anywhere since my interview in 2010. My contact at the old firm moved to a different state, and I can't get my foot back in the door.

I was in the top quarter of my class, although I went to a third tier school. I have good recommendations from respected people in my field, although they are from 2009. I was active in law school in groups and activities that supported my intended field. That is to say, I put my money where my mouth was. 

Despite being in solo-practice, I have a fraction of the experience of people who've been fully employed since 2009 or 2010. And every day I'm not working, I'm losing ground on my peers. 

I recently got a rejection letter for a job that was almost identical to the one I expected to have after law school. 

Again, I didn't even manage to get an interview. That was pretty much the last straw, as if I can't even get an interview for something to which I tailored my entire law school experience, I think it's a sign from God to move on. 

I have not explored contract positions, part time / limited term work, or volunteer work. I suppose those are the logical next steps, along with non-lawyer work. But at this point my confidence is basically shot, and I'm sure I'm starting to sound like a drunken guy hitting on a hot bartender to potential employers. In other words, the desperation is obvious at this point. 

I spent a lot of time being optimistic, and I kept my head down and trudged forward. I counseled my friends who were unemployed to do the same, much to their annoyance. But, now I'm ready to say it. Law school was a huge mistake. 

I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I know others have it the same or worse, and there isn't really anything special or unique about my version of the last four years. Just felt like sharing. "	t5_2qh9k	True

* I hear /r/SCOTUS is quite lovely this time of year. 

-----

**Opinions** 

**1) Koontz v. SJRWM (Alito writes, 5-4)**

*Issue:* (1) Whether a land-use agency can be held liable for a taking when it refused to issue a land-use permit on the sole basis that the permit applicant did not accede to a permit condition that, if applied, would violate the essential nexus and rough proportionality tests set out in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) and Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) (2) whether the nexus and proportionality tests set out in Nollan and Dolan apply to a land-use exaction that takes the form of a government demand that a permit applicant dedicate money, services, labor, or any other type of personal property to a public use.

*Holding summary:* The government's demand for property from a land use permit applicant must satisfy the Nolan and Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1447_6j37.pdf)

* Florida State Court is reversed 

* Justice Kagan dissents, with Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor.

* ""Significant victory for property rights advocates.""

* [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_1447) with the facts of the case and oral argument.  

------

**2) Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl (Alito writes, 5-4 )**

**This is a victory for the adoptive parents**

*Issue:* (1) Whether a non-custodial parent can invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-63, to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law; and (2) whether ICWA defines “parent” in 25 U.S.C. § 1903(9) to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent.

*Held:* ""Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a “parent” under the ICWA, neither §1912(f) nor §1912(d) bars the termination of his parental rights. Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of parental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the parent’s “continued custody of the child.” The adjective “continued” plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary definitions. The phrase “continued custody” thus refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a result, §1912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child...Section 1915(a)’s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Biological Father is not covered by §1915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought by Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-399_8mj8.pdf)

* Justice Scalia dissents, and Sotomayor dissents which is joined by by Ginsburg and Kagan. 

* [Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) on the case from earlier this week

------

**3) Shelby County v. Holder (Roberts writes, 5-4)**

**Section 4 is unconstitutional**

**""Section 5 is now dormant""**

*Issue:* Issue: Whether Congress’ decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution.

*Summary holding:* Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. The Court emphasizes that: ""There is also a “fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” among the States, which is highly pertinent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin, supra, at 203. The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles. It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own...Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in [Section] 2. We issue no holding on [Section] 5 itself, only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf )

* Ginsburg dissents, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan 

* [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_96) page with case facts and oral argument. 

* [Voting Rights Act](http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf)

* [Statement](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/statement-president-supreme-court-ruling-shelby-county-v-holder) by the President on Shelby. For those of you who do not know, President Obama was a constitutional law professor who had taught entire classes on voting rights. 

* Amy Howe: ""Today’s holding in Shelby County v. Holder, in Plain English: Today the Court issued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder, the challenge to the constitutionality of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act. That portion of the Act was designed to prevent discrimination in voting by requiring all state and local governments with a history of voting discrimination to get approval from the federal government before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures, no matter how small. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, the Court did not invalidate the principle that preclearance can be required. But much more importantly, it held that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which sets out the formula that is used to determine which state and local governments must comply with Section 5’s preapproval requirement, is unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus, although Section 5 survives, it will have no actual effect unless and until Congress can enact a new statute to determine who should be covered by it.""

I just finished my first year of law school at a top 50 ranked US law school and have been a little disheartened by my grade performance. I ended up in the bottom 10% of my class for the first year and I have to say it really feels shitty to be in that position.

My question is, of all of you current lawyers, who was in the bottom 10% of their class (or thereabouts) but still went on to have a successful career in the law? I've heard the arguments that ""there has to be someone in the bottom 10%"" and other similar platitudes, but I want to see if anyone in my position actually ended up being successful in their career.

I'm a high school junior who's quite active in politics and interested in politics and law. They're both my passion, but I've been very discouraged by my peers, parents, and others about my aspirations of going into law. They say there isn't any jobs in the field, that I should just stick to Technology or Science. Is this true? Should I just plan on getting a BS in Comp Sci instead? I don't think it'd interest me nearly as much as law... If not, what should I do now to help with this? I really don't know what to do.. and with the SAT, ACT and other entrance exams coming up... I've been thinking about this quite a bit. 

To be honest, my grades in high school aren't so great (I've been really lazy and have terrible study habits. I've heard law school is demanding, but the reason I'm lazy is because the subjects I'm forced to take don't engage me... I ended up passing my AP US Government exam and making a 96 in that class because it's something I'm passionate about...)

I desperately need a fresh perspective on my situation.  I gave up a highly respected public interest job to join a small firm as partner.  I liked the prestige that came with my old position, but the work was rote and there was no room for growth.  At the firm, we operate on an ""eat what you kill"" model, and after a couple of years I'm still barely covering basic living expenses with my current practice, which consists primarily of transactional and small business startup work.  My clients have to scrape to come up with retainers of only a few hundred dollars, and they're constantly haggling or looking to cut corners, which means a lot of time editing documents they found on the Internet and then struggling to get them to pay for it.  Because I don't have money to live on, I can't afford to take contingency work.

I love the practice of law, and general consensus seems to be that I'm good at it, but advancing the business seems to be an endless struggle.  I give lectures every couple of months, and each one leads to one or two new, low-dollar clients, but I can't understand how any solo or small firm practitioner makes ends meet this way.  We have a small advertising budget, but none of our efforts have borne fruit.

The more accomplished attorneys I've sought out have all basically said, ""we'd send you referrals if we had them, but times are tough and we have no resources or advice.""  

Has anyone out there been in this position and come through the other side?  In my ideal world I'd be focused mostly on contract negotiation and drafting for institutional clients, but at this point I'd be willing to do anything that would pay the bills and even marginally hold my attention.

I honestly don't know what to do, or where to go from here.  Some days I feel like I'd be happier working at Starbucks- at least there the clients would say ""thank you"" and I'd have health insurance.

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for your thoughtful responses!  Feel free to keep them coming.  This really does provide some much-needed direction.

SUMMARY:

 
We, T. (a professor of legal writing) and H. (a recent law school grad) have an idea.  We are in the early stages of co-authoring a law review article.  Rather than muddle through it on our own, we want to involve Reddit in the writing, editing and publishing of it.  It would be, as far as we can tell, the first ever crowd-sourced law review article.  
 
Our questions: Should we do it?  If so, do you want to be a contributor?
 

THE BACKGROUND:
 
We have been working together for a few years.  H. was T.'s research assistant and, before that, a student in his class.  In addition to collaborating on some projects, we enjoyed sending each other interesting articles, most of which were directly relevant to law, but not always.  
 
One piece was this one [http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all] from Wired.  It discusses the inventor of ""Super Memo,"" and the power of spaced repetition to aid in memorization.  The discussions we had got us thinking about the role of memorization in law (specifically for things like preparation for oral argument, but also for bar prep or exam studying).  T. discovered that no one had written a law review article on the topic of memorization and its role in lawyering and he started to draft an article.  Then, as things happen, he got waylaid and the idea was pushed aside.  
 
Fast forward to May 2012.  H. graduated, and it was time for him to start prepping for the bar.  Remembering what he'd once read on spaced repetition, he decided to try that technique to aid in his bar studying.  He researched on Reddit and elsewhere and used what he learned to create bar prep flashcard decks using Anki (one of the free programs available to help one memorize through spaced repetition).  
 
H. liked the spaced repetition method so much that Anki became his main mode of outside-of-bar-class-preparation.  Indeed, he liked it so much he convinced some of his classmates to do likewise.  H. is confident that using Anki worked like a charm for him, and anxiously, and confidently, awaits his bar results.  His enthusiasm got T. thinking that maybe it's time to finish that article to share the usefulness of spaced repetition for law with the world.
 
WHY WRITE A LAW REVIEW ARTICLE WITH REDDITORS?
 
For a few reasons.  First, because a lot of our ideas came from Redditors and we believe in the power of Reddit.  Second, because academic scholarship tends to be stale, uninteresting, and disconnected from reality.  We think Reddit is full of folks who would help us do something different than that.  Third, it's cool to be the first one to plant the flag on the moon.  No one's ever done anything like this, so why not us?  Finally, because we think it will be fun, challenging and valuable to participants and readers alike.
 
WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE?
 
Well, we should talk it through as a group (meaning all of you should ultimately weigh in if we go forward), but we favor having no artificial guidelines.  The project would benefit from the work of folks who have both highly specialized knowledge and those who are just generally attentive and bright.  In short, if you're smart, work hard and are enthusiastic, there's almost definitely a place for you.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR CONTRIBUTORS?
 
On the concrete level, your name would be added as a contributor (hopefully, we'd get a nice long footnote that in a paragraph explains how we wrote the article and lists all participants).  Assuming some law review publishes us, your name will be in Lexis and Westlaw forever as part of a fun and new project and you'll get a resume line out of it.
 
But that's not really what it's about.  More broadly, you'll get to do a little research, hopefully meet/work with some interesting folks, and also play an important role in passing along information that should be useful to others.
 
WHAT NOW?
 
We'd like your input.  Are you interested?  Should we do it?  If there's some enthusiasm, we'll lay out some ideas we have about how to pull it off efficiently and and ask for input and advice, then use the group's advice and move forward.

We've created a subreddit for this topic, which is r/redditlawreview.  Feel free to post/respond there.

Considering law school just for the sake of learning. I love to read and analyze things. Honestly didn't consider becoming a lawyer however, since picking up an LSAT book, the past few weeks of studying a few hours a day for fun has changed the way I thought and considered my environment around me. I'm more assertive around my friends when I used to be passive. I enjoy this positive change and wish it to be a part of who I am. Took a practice LSAT, scored a 165 (top 10%) with time left. Pretty high undergrad GPA.

I'd like to go into a top 20 law school and see where that takes me. Advice on applying or doing anything in the meanwhile?

I majored in bio/chem and minored in math/psych/scihonorsprogram/biochem while working full time as an education director, conducting research, and volunteering at a hospital. Lots of good recommendation letters. Was gonna do medicine but recently decided against it. Considered finance/econometrics/training for olympics (next 4 years or never)/PhD in education or psychology/or law school. Kinda don't want to practice law but I feel like I can learn to enjoy it. I'd also love to pursue a career in acting sometime in the future if ever possible but that might be for different post.


I immensely enjoy studying for the LSAT and I find it highly stimulating and personally rewarding. Studying a few hours and run a few miles a day makes me feel fulfilled.


Not sure if this matters but my father's side were all lawyers and judges in his native country. My dad is a math professor and my mother is a nurse.

I'm a strong introvert but can master things rather quickly including adapting to social situations and climbing tall hierarchical ladders and perform very well when needed (gave some great speeches at school [managed my SGO parties campaign and ran for senate] and scientific conferences). [INTJ] with INTP INFP tendencies in necessary situations.


**People with law degrees, have any of you guys ended up doing anything besides law?** Or if you ended up practicing law, like it? love it? hate it? learned to love it? Any introverts in law school or practicing law? Any advice is highly appreciated.

TL;DR - I think I'm smart enough to do well in law school. Willing to work my butt off but wondering if people can give me guidance to the tools to be able to figure out what I can do with my life. Maybe internships before/during/after law school? Clerk-ships? Tips for what I can do right now before possible matriculation in 2 years? Anything?

I then resold the books in August for $275. I probably could have gotten more if I wanted to. 

Your BarBri course is basically going to be a series of lectures going over the outlines in the BarBri books. I know because my girlfriend took the course and failed her bar exam. You are not getting one bit of additional information from going to the lectures.

**1) Descamps v. US (Kagan writes, 8-1)**

Issue: Whether, in a case under the Armed Career Criminal Act, when a state crime does not require an element of the federal crime of burglary, the federal court may find the existence of that element by examining the record of the state proceedings under the ""modified categorical approach.""

Decision summary: *The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes that contain a single indivisible set of elements. ""In Plain English, it is now harder for the government to use the facts of a prior conviction to enhance a federal criminal sentence.""*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-9540_8m58.pdf)

9th Circuit reversed.

Justice Alito dissents.

-----

**2) AmEx v. Italian Colors (Scalia writes, 5-3)**

Issue: Whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts, invoking the “federal substantive law of arbitrability,” to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a federal-law claim. 

Decision summary: *The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff’s cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. ""In Plain English, this means that if you have a contract with a business in which you agree to arbitrate a dispute but it says you can't get together with other plaintiffs in a ""class action,"" that contract will be enforced, even if it may be too expensive for you to pursue your own claim given what you might win.""*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-133_19m1.pdf)

2nd Circuit reversed. 

Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan dissent. 

Sotomayor recused.

**3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes, 6-2)**

Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C. § 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.

Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program. The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-10_21p3.pdf)

2nd Circuit affirmed. 

Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

Kagan recused.

- We can now confidently speculate that Shelby County v. Holder will be written by Roberts. This is due to Scalia writing the AmEx decision today. This favors the plaintiffs in Shelby County. 

- We can now confidently speculate that Koontz v. St. Johns River will be written by Alito. This is due to Kagan writing the Descamps decision today. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Alito will write the opinion in Vance v. Ball State. This favors the respondent Ball State. 

- We can confidently speculate that Kennedy will write the opinion in Fisher v. UT-Austin. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Roberts and Kennedy will be writing Perry/Windsor. No consensus on what this means for the decision.

1357938696.0	16eexi	29-year-old attorney having trouble with older opposing counsel.  Any suggestions?	burgler	56	9	35	"Hi Lawwwit (if that's what it's called), I'm in a bit of a frustrating situation with opposing counsel.  I practice in a mid-sized community; most of the attorneys in the county ""know of"" each other, if not know each other.  I'm 29, and have only been doing litigation work for about a year or so, out of a small office where I work with family.  I'm very much the new guy.

I've got a sticky case involving a claim against an estate, and the estate is being represented by a well-known attorney around town.  He's got the perfect LEGO dome of white hair, the tasteful suits, the new A5 coupe, the two-page spread in the yellow pages, the professional website, the works.  A purportedly nice guy, but I'm beginning to wonder about how he's treating me.

We went to mediate this case last month, where we spent all morning at opposing counsel's office while the mediator ran back and forth between us in opposite conference rooms, hashing out a deal.  I reached what I thought was a good deal with the mediator, who conveyed it to opposing counsel, who accepted it.  Mediator and clients left, and I asked opposing counsel to sit down and put it into writing.  Here's where it goes south.

He claims that a piece of property which I and the mediator thought was going to my client would instead remain with opposing counsel's client.  He repeatedly asserts that his interpretation of the deal is right (it's not, I checked with the mediator and he's with me), and that regardless of the deal we thought we had reached, surrendering that property is off the table.

I don't know if he was honestly confused.  I highly doubt that's the case, since I sketched out a diagram showing what property went to whom, and I'm sure the mediator showed it to him.  I'm starting to think that he said one thing to the mediator, and then once the mediator left, he said a different thing to me, thinking he could just steamroll me into giving up $130,000 that everyone had agreed was going to my client, and I'd have to just take it, because I'm the new guy in the county.

Also, there's been a pattern of behavior where he doesn't seem to want to hear what I've got to say.  He speaks non-stop during our meetings with the judge and the judicial attorney, and it's hard to get a word in edgewise.  His staff is really blunt with my staff; they are not pleased to see his office come up on the callerID.  In general, I get the feeling that he doesn't really care much about what I have to say.

I'm not asking for a pick-me-up, or platitudes about sticking up for yourself.  I'm not a passive person by nature, and I handle other attorneys of varying ages just fine.  I just wonder if some of the other young attorneys have been in a similar situation, where you felt condescended to, because of your age or status as the new person in town.  What did you do to get opposing counsel back in line without being a jerk about it?  I'd be happy to just write it off as a personality clash and avoid working with him in the future, but in the here and now, I've got a lot of my client's money to get back.

Thanks for any thoughts, y'all.

I can surf reddit for hours even though I have work to do. I haven't been too busy this month and maybe I feel like I'm underutilized at work, but for example, aside from my normal workload, which I feel like I can do standing on my head at this point, I have had this one freaking agreement to review sitting on my desk for *weeks*.


Part of it is that I'm not familiar with the type of agreement it is, and it's a little bit stressful doing work you don't know how to do, but I feel that another part of it is that I'm just a fuck up junkie addict. I finally got the agreement done last night and this morning after pissing off my client with the delay.  I hammered it out in maybe 5 hours to get it out fast, and then in my final draft, my client pointed out glaring typo in the freaking table of contents. I'm making a very bad impression. I feel like a slow motion train wrecking dumbass, seriously. Perhaps I haven't been using my brain to its fullest capacity and I am getting dull. Perhaps my reddit/internet addiction is slowly destroying my professional aptitude. It's hard for me to read bs on the internet for four hours and then jump straight into sharp, discerning, legal brilliance that most of us are completely capable of when we are focused and put our minds to it. 


I call up one of my closest lawyer buddies and confess to him. He admits that he does that kind of thing all the time. He will have to review a document and is completely unfamiliar with the area of the law and just let it get buried for weeks. That only makes me feel a little better because I have the impression that he's super productive and I'm still surfing reddit. 

I don't work in an environment where I have to bill hours or meet production quotas or perhaps those types of things might help me stay away from time wasting on the internet. I'm just supposed to be a subject matter expert more or less on call for 2-3 major clients. I answer their emails, return their phone calls, keep a seat warm at their meetings, and occasionally draft what they need. 


So any other lawyers here have internet addiction problems that interfere with their work? What are your strategies for fighting it and staying motivated?

1302631089.0	godo0	A law student in need of wiser, more learned perspectives on the law school, the legal culture, and lawyering in general.  	OliveDiPace	57	7	46	"So my first year of law school is near its end (!!!) and I've been reflecting  a lot on my impressions and concerns about law school.  Actually, this post is more related to my concerns than my impressions.  I'm just wondering if these concerns and observations translate outside of school into the actual legal industry, and what practicing lawyers have to say about my thoughts. I've come to love law school and suppressed any doubt about my place in it.  A lot of things, however, do bother me and I'm wondering if these are realities outside law school that I will have to cope with in the industry...

**[1]** For one, is it just me, or do a lot of people who are really smart, but sheltered and naive, do well in law school?  I can think of a lot of people in my class who work hard, earn good grades, but have no common sense or understanding about the practicalities of the real world.  What happens to these people?  Do they do well in the real world of practicing law?  In your experience, do street smarts, intuition, social skills, and practical knowledge of the real world help you more than good grades will (given your performance in legal analysis and writing is satisfactory)?  

**[2]** Second, there have been moments this year where I've observed the culture of the legal profession to be culturally insensitive.  For example, I was at a ""networking workshop"" which was set up as a cocktail reception.  After they allowed us to practice networking for 45 minutes, a District Judge advised everyone to never drink at these events.  She told us that she ""would never hire anyone that was having a drink or eating at receptions because it looks sloppy.""  Was this just one uptight bitch I ran into, or is the culture of this industry really this stringent and prudent? 

**[3]** Third, I feel like too many law students isolate themselves from real world issues and the world outside the law.  I feel that, because the general public respects authorities on the law, we as future attorneys have a duty to be informed about the current events in our country and the political process.  No joke, some of my peers make fun of me because I like to read the news and talk about politics;  before law school, I thought law students would be all about this.  I get called a liberal hippy for some of my beliefs that remain unacknowledged by my peers.  I'm actually still shocked at the number of students that actively chose to remain ignorant and not have an informed opinion on issues, or avert themselves from having these kind of discussions.  Sure there are students who get into public interest law and the school requires us to do community service hours, but I've had difficulty finding those that take a genuine interest in social and political justice outside their career.  Maybe its just my generation, but are practicing attorney's equally detached from issues of social and political justice in the real world?  In the practicing world, will I make a better impression with others by talking about the last Yankee game than I will if I talk about the most recent statute passed by Congress?  

**[4]** Lastly, so many of my peers have *too much* confidence that its makes me blood boil.  Its strange to me that the law teaches us to be critical and to look at issues from both sides, but at the same time, there are many students who cannot look beyond their own side.  I think my observation is best illustrated, in an extreme, by that racist email that leaked from a 3L at Harvard Law.  What is especially scary about that e-mail is that the racist belief is written in such an eloquent way but we disbelieve it because its undisputed that the argument of it is fundamentally wrong.  This makes me think of how often law students argue minor ideas that are fundamentally wrong, but remain unquestioned because their words sound ""reasonable"" (whatever that means anymore) and bolstered by confidence.  In the past year, the law has humbled me and made me always second guess my thoughts, but it seems to have had the opposite effect on a lot of my peers.  Thus, my question is do law students carry on their ego after graduation, or does a taste of the real world shut them down?  Of course as an attorney you have to have confidence is your speaking and communication, but does the real world of practicing reveal all the unknowns of the law that school hides from us, which requires a whole new learning process to gain confidence in our abilities and thinking?  Are a lot or few attorneys apt at separating their confidence in their legal work from their confidence or self-value as a person?  

I guess what I'm really getting at here is what parts of the culture of law school remain in law school, and what parts carry on into the legal profession?  Working is a much different environment than school, so I imagine that a lot of the dynamic changes.  Did any of you feel this way in law school?  The points above are just things that I noticed and would like more perspectives on, but all perspectives and input are sincerely welcome.  These are all questions that I've wanted to ask, but never really mustered up the confidence to ask because I don't want to hurt my reputation as a negative nancy or insolent.  And if you got this far in reading this, thank you for time and interest.  Have a wonderful day.  

**tldr: what parts of the legal culture in law school remain in law school, and what parts carry on into the industry after graduation?  Do law students change when they actually start practicing?  After graduating and practicing law, what qualities and characteristics of older attorneys were you pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised by, that were different from the law school environment?** "	t5_2qh9k	True

In everyday English, a person might say ""That's a sound argument,"" ""Did you hear that sound?"", or ""Her laugh sounds odd."" All fairly conventional usage.

But in legal writing, one will often see something like, ""The Plaintiff's claim sounds in contract, not in tort."" After glancing through the free online Oxford, I don't see any definition that quite covers that usage. 

Another example is  _cabin_. Although not as peculiar, the word is used to mean ""confine,"" e.g., ""Congress therefore did not attempt precisely to cabin the scope of the Securities Acts.""

The precise wording doesn't change between companies, which makes me suspect that it's legal language.  Either that or they all use the same PR firm or something.

From a computer science standpoint, [direct access](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/direct+access) is simply a way to read data from a disk without starting the read from the beginning of the disk.  Direct access is usually the most efficient way to read data, unless you are copying entire drives or something like that.  An alternative to direct access is sequential access, where the pointer begins at the start of the disk and continues until it finds the data it is looking for.

From a business standpoint, [direct access](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/direct-access.html) means that a person is given access to a resource or individual with no intermediary.  If you have to go through a security check point to enter a building or if you have to use a password to access a database then that means your access is not direct.

If I have time to prepare for an exam or thoroughly research a very narrow, specific issue, I feel like I can write about it intelligently.  But if I'm put on the spot in a social situation when the topic of conversation turns to the law, whether it's a general conversation about current legal news or conversations about classes with law-school friends, I feel like I don't contribute anything.

On the other end, I see a lot of Prop 8 &amp; DOMA opposition attempting to argue that the equal rights of citizens aren’t subject to democratic vote. Both views reveal a basic misunderstanding of how U.S. law works. 

The US is a constitutional republic, meaning citizens are free to vote for or against anything they want, including the rights of their neighbor citizens, so long as what they’re voting on is legal within the confines of our constitution at that time.  The US Constitution is, of course, democratically designed – first by our founding fathers and then continually via our amendment process.  We can legally strip a particular class of citizens of certain rights that others might enjoy by (not so) simply amending the Constitution pursuant to its Article V.  

The courts didn’t free the slaves; the Thirteenth Amendment did. The courts didn’t legalize abortion so much as they interpreted it as part of the Right of Privacy that is implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The courts didn’t give citizens a personal right to firearms within reasonable limits so much as they interpreted the Second Amendment as granting such a right…and that was only really solidified in DC v. Heller in 2010.

Consequently, the courts cannot unilaterally grant gay citizens equal marriage rights unless the Constitution requires it - a Constitution that was already voted upon and ratified by our elected national and state representatives via a process that requires a much higher level of democratic agreement than either DOMA or Prop 8 required.  This is what the cases at bar are addressing.

In other words: are Prop 8 and/or DOMA violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and, therefore, overriding the democratic process in order to deny a certain class of citizens a right enjoyed by other classes? 

Please let me know if I'm interpreting this wrong. I'm a lawyer but not a Con Law scholar by any means.

I have a few questions and would very much like to get some understandable answers. I got in a heated debate about the legality of some of the stuff reddit is so upset about atm. One of the arguments was that something illegal happened regarding the publication of the private info of some redditors but I really didn't get the point exactly *what* was illegal about this whole doxxing thing.

So, these are my questions:

1.) Is it illegal for a normal person to ""doxx"" someone (compile his publicly available information - including the stuff on reddit - without hacking his private accounts) and release this information on a blog (not including telephone numbers afaik but picture and name)?

2.) Is it illegal for a journalist to do the something similar and publish it as part of a newspaper article / a news website? Does public interest play a role if he can do so? Are there instances where this has been forbidden?

3.) What is a newspaper allowed to publish about a private citizen (picture, pixelated picture, name, last name, shortened last name) and in what instances?

4.) Does tortius behaviour have anything do with this? 

I hope this doesn't come across as circlejerky, but I actually find this quite interesting because it's this crossroad between privacy/freedom of speech that will get evermore important on the internet in the following years."	t5_2qh9k	True
