Like every other teen I was eager to get my paws on the most amazing game out there.  I spawned on Grove Street and went for a stroll around the neighborhood with my trusty camera equipped.  After beating a few Ho's to death my mother walked in to ask about dinner.  I quickly did a 180 turn and started walking down the sidewalk by Carl's house.  

She looks over my shoulder, ""What game is this?  *Pause and pull out camera* ""It's simply an urban photography game mom."" ""Oh neat,"" she replies.  She continues to watch as I nervously take photographs of section 8 housing.  As soon as I pull down my camera, a bitch whore walks into me and says something to the extent of ""You want a good time honey?""  to which Carl replies back something along the lines of ""Out of my way bitch"" and my mom simply says ""Well, it's pretty realistic.""  One week later she bought me a $100 headset and said, ""I don't want to hear it.""

1365869202.0	1c9ut8	Something hilarious I witness while playing GTA IV	crazyassfool	127	26	28	"Last night I was at a friend's house playing some GTA IV, just messing around. I was at an intersection and saw a guy driving a car that I wanted. There was also a cop directly across on the other side of the intersection, but I didn't care so I stole the guy's car anyways. I was prepared to outrun the cops, but they didn't seem to care, so I was at 0 stars. Well the guy whose car I stole opened the door and yanked me out, and started punching me. I was trying to switch to my knife so I could shank him, but before I could do that, the cops that were on the other side of the intersection came over and pointed their guns at the guy. He walked over to their car, got in the back, and they drove him away. My friend and I busted out laughing.
I have never seen anything like this in a GTA game. Didn't even know the civilians could get arrested.

TL;DR - Stole a guy's car, cops didn't care, he tried to beat me up, then he got arrested."	t5_2ra77	True

Of course a cab decides to merge and I rear end him, my body flies about fifty yards near pedestrians and of course I die.... The thing that got me was right as I died a pedestrian yelled, ""My god I want to go back to San Andreas!""

I just chuckled and realized I can't wait for this game. 
Just my two cents...

You have one person playing as either a prison escapee/wanted criminal, everyone else on the team are cops tasked with apprehending him. 

The criminal is  allowed a small time of head start to flee from the cops, before they begin a manhunt for him. They have no indication of him on the radar unless the criminal commits a crime/remains in the open or close to NPCs/civilians for too long. Being spotted in this way gives a radar location similar to the Wanted level in GTA4, where its a small circle around the criminal until they are out of sight/out of the circle for a period of time.

The cops **must** subdue the criminal in a less-lethal fashion and apprehend them unless they have used some sort of deadly force or killed someone."	t5_2ra77	True

I posted this in the V subforum, but it didn't seem to resonate with the people there. No one actually bothered to tell me why they're downvoting it (it's a self.post anyway, so it's not like I'm out for karma), so I'm trying it here. Don't misunderstand, I can totally accept if people think this is a bad idea, but some feedback would be appreciated.

I always loved rare and unique vehicles in the GTA franchise. That got me thinking, what about a side mission that involves rebuilding a special/classic ride in GTA V (or the DLC).

Here's how I picture it being implemented: You're on a story mission which involves breaking into a house to steal something or to kill the tenant (not really important at this point). You get in through the garage and spot a classic American Muscle car or a stylish old Cadillac stripped down to the bare essentials. Your character takes note and proceeds with whatever the original mission is.


After it's completed you get the optional side mission to retrieve the vehicle. But first you have to get your hands on a deed to a garage/chop shop. There are several possibilities for missions here. Win it in a race, extort the owner into signing over the deed by catching him with his mistress, or to simply buy it.

Once you have a place to store and rebuild the car you actually need to get it out of the place you saw it. Problem is that it's on lockdown/surveillance by the criminal organization (or even the police since it's a crime scene) you pissed off by completing the original mission. Clear out all hostiles to move in with the truck and load up the ride.

Now there'd be two, three more missions getting parts to rebuild it. Perhaps there's a shipment rolling through town that has the wheels you want, or a notorious street racer has the engine you just have to have for your ride. There are quite a few ways to create interesting and varied missions.

And at the end of it all you'll have it, your one-of-a-kind ride that handles like a dream. What do you think?

There have been many times where I could have used this, but the most recent I can think of was my last time re-playing GTA IV, I was doing a mission and I saw a cop just standing outside of some guys house, kinda like he was Witness Protection, but for the life of me, I can't find the alley-way to go back and investigate. 

Just something small that would be nice! 

TL;DR: A blip that you can put on the map to remind you to investigate at a later time.

GAME 1: Guess who's packin'

In GTAIV I go to shady neighborhoods, pull out a gun, and target people at random. If they aren't carrying a gun, they will put their hands in the air or run. I just let them go. If they ARE packing, then I run and duck behind a car, call the cops, and watch the awesome shootout.

GAME 2: Taxi Taunting

In GTAIV I get a police officer near me either by going to a police station, calling the cops, or finding an officer standing somewhere. Once the cop is in close range I take my fist and hit the door of a taxi cab. This won't alert the cops, however it will piss off the cabby and he chases you. I position myself to where the cop is between myself and the cabby when the cabby swings to punch me. This results in the cabby punching the police officer and the cabby getting arrested.
(For a fun twist, I taunt a security guard instead by punching him away from the cops. The guards are always carrying guns so when the  cops show up a gun fight breaks out.)"	t5_2ra77	True

And especially in GTA IV. The fact that I can hail a cab, shoot some pool, go to a show, tip a street musician, ride a train, watch TV or check my fucking ATM is incredible - things that were only backdrop with no interactivity whatsoever in other games are part of the experience of living in Liberty City.

I can't wait to see how Rockstar delivers in GTA V - from what I've read, it promises to be even more immersive, interactive, massive and detailed than anything I've ever seen...from anyone.

In my opinion, we already have next-gen gaming...and its name is Rockstar. Because nothing I have ever seen from any other developer has come close to what they have done - and are about to do again."	t5_2ra77	True

**Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers   Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers**









I just recently got the game, and this is the first game I actually payed attention to the story line. I loved every.minute.of.it. I just found it to have a great story, I was really immersed. I found myself to get emotionally attached to the characters. Oh, they blew up Romans shop? Ugh I feel terrible, this is all my fault.
 
I got really attached to Michelle, before I went on dates with her, my driving would be complete shit. I would go out of my way to impress her! I learned that she really liked the Admiral, Comet, and PMP 600 (Later on I learned there is a wiki for all this). Before showing up to her house, I would HAVE to get one of those (or settle for a Patriot). Once I went and got a nice suit, thinking it would impress her. Only to find out later she likes the Russian looks better. My driving improved while she was in the car. And then, she shows up as a cop, my heart SUNK, I felt ( I WAS) betrayed. I drove my car home slowly, like I was depressed, and drank numerous times. For that matter, I always took out my dates in nice cars. 

I was actually REALLY happy when I heard Roman and Mallorie were getting married. 

I felt horrible, and hated Frankie when he made me kill his brother. I thought I had no choice. He is a sly son of a bitch too, his contact didn't clear my wanted level, always voicemail. Asshole...... 

When Roman was kidnapped, I was enraged, I stocked up on so much fire power. I unleashed hell, that entire mission. I killed everything in my way. 

I have a question. Am I the only one that would get more impressive cars when going to something important? Whether it be a date, arriving to the funeral/wedding, any mission that gave you two choices. 

Anyways, when I finally met draco, I was really pumped. I went to one of the gun stores. I bought full mags for every weapon, a dozen rockets, and a few grenades. I picked up Roman in my nice black PMP 600, and sped my way to the airport, surprisingly I avoided all collisions. I didn't think twice, I unloaded all my Deagle ammo, and start raining lead on his ass. Didn't feel any remorse. 

This is the part it really hurt. I knew Roman wanted the money, he could have an amazing time with the money, and I could too. Fuck Kate, she doesn't understand how I felt, and frankly I really don't give a shit about her as a character. I immediately thought ""If I got the money, Roman will live"" (I knew the choice would leave one of them dead). Without much thought to the matter, I hopped in my Infernus and zoomed my way to the money icon. I was happy I stocked up on explosives too, I got through that warehouse in a 5 minutes tops. Pissed off that I was once again fucked over, I wasted no time retrieving the money. Took out my deagle, shot away both back tires. And before he even got to the highway, his brains were splattered over the dashboard, and heading straight into the corner of a building. 

I decided I needed to show up in a classy car with really nice clothes, I picked up the most expensive shoes, and matching suit. Quickly took a white PMP (I like them :D ) and casually made my way to the wedding. I enjoyed the cutscene. But my heart sank the second I saw the man behind Niko....I hated Niko, which made me hate myself. I WAS NIKO. I hated that my instinct pushed the gun away from myself. I DESERVED THAT BULLET. Like I went on to say later, ROMAN NEVER DID ANYTHING, he loved me, he put up with my shit, when I ditched him and drinking to go fuck and kill a hooker, he would still send that stupid pussy-crazed maniac to drive me around. He had my back, it was clear he was happy to see me in America. Everything bad that happened to him, was MY FAULT, I NEVER thought about the ramifications that would be instilled on my family and friends. He was my best friend. My titty buddy. He was my family. My ONLY FUCKING FAMILY on this god damned island. 

My gut instinct was to kill that fuck face Dimtri the second I had the chance, but I had a moment of weakness, at the time I thought it was strength. For a second, a split second, I remembered ""He keeps telling me to think, and EVERY time I don't think, he gets in trouble"" I told my self that only this ONE time, not exacting revenge would be the right move. And it was the SOLE reason he is dead, I went against my gut. And he is fucking dead, FUCKING GONE. That stupid bitch kate. 

Fast forward a few minutes later, I'm pursuing Dimtri in the chopper. My knuckles are white from gripping the mouse and pushing the buttons so hard. The second I land on Happiness Island I dont let go of the trigger. I shot 500 rounds of AK before killing him. I killed all the pedestrians, cops, and I finally get to Dimtri. The sound of his death, the scream, the bullet holes in his chest. Gave me a sort of satisfaction I never thought possible. I said to myself, in real life, ""This is for you my cousin.""

Then it hit me. Roman is still dead, I am not getting him back, ever. With this thought I became sad. Very sad. I walked over to the dock, I imagined my self throwing all my weapons into the ocean, and there I stood. My view shifted to provide a cinematic view of my front, with the statue in the background, I stood. For a half hour, I shed tears, I swear to you it looked like I shed tears in the game too. 

I wanted to die. I had been shot, fallen, and beat unconscious before, but I don't want to wake up in those fucking hospitals. I want to be dead. With this I plotted my last stand. I was going to go out with a bang, a big bang. I took a boat, then a car to the first gunstore I found early on when I arrived in this gone-to-hell country and worse state. I bought all the ammo for all my weapons, I bought twenty rockets, and 15 cocktails. With  full body armor and health, I went to the map. I decided the end would be the start. In this, I mean, I started at Mr.Faustins resident. I stood in front of my phantom, I chose this because it is a beast. But moreover, I hoped it would would help become just that, a phantom. I casually walked out in my ""Double Breasted Jacket in Granite &amp; Turtle Neck with Basalt Pants"" and took out my sidearm. I shot two rounds in the air. Before the people had a chance to run, I took out my RPG. The rocket tore its way into a  Premier before exploding, taking out a beater and voodoo. This set off a chain reaction, before I could get moving four cars had exploded, and  my rushed counting showed 18 people dead. I had a two star level already. I rammed my way through the sea of abandoned cars and made my way to my first stop. 

If this is popular I will edit with the rest of the story....I have to poop.

EDIT: Part 2

My mind was completely clear, or so I thought. As I rolled up to my first stop. I had several cruisers and a helicopter after me, but I wasn't intimated. Somehow I got lucky with traffic, the cops were a few blocks behind me. I took advantage of this moment, I casually got out of my Phantom and muttered to my self ""See you in hell you slimy fuck"" as I fired a rocket at the row of police cruisers parked in front of the building. Four blew up, I know for a fact eight officers were killed, countless civilians. I unloaded a few clips into the building, sending a message that, I, Niko Bellic, am not a force to be fucked with. I got back into my truck just as the first few cruisers closed in on me, I gleamed with happiness as I got a fourth star. Again I plowed through the abandoned traffic again. Chuckling at the sound of all the screams, sirens, explosions, and crunching metal made. Snickering as I honked my horn, as if I expected the cars to move.....

The next part played out perfectly in my planning, but I basically had to wing it, it couldn't be setup. As I barrel down Panhandle road, I make a very nicely timed jump from the overpass, onto catskill ave, I land on a roof. The adrenaline is racing through me now, it is working better than planned.  While my now nearly-in-flames Phantom rolls down the freeway, along with a few badly driving cruisers, I jump down quickly and jack a parked sedan. Suddenly my wanted level increases, I wasn't expecting this really. I am caught off guard by a speeding NOOSE patriot. My driving skills are already proficient, but this startled me. I somehow manage to level out my vehicle after being knocked to two wheels for about a block. 

My palms are sweating at this point, I take a sharp turn onto beaver head ave. I am almost out of range when I reach my final destination. You guessed it. The old casino. I try to run over a few bums as I pull in, fucking scum. I remember that there are two way to get onto the roof, in a quick change of plans I stashed my sedan in front of the main door, bums are trying to run out as I run in, FUCK YOU I scream. I unload shell after shell of my shotgun into each of their dirty fucking chests. I can hear the cops ramming each other as they pull into the lot, those fucking pigs, worse driving than me when I'm drunk. I run up the stairs, and take a post. Its far enough that they can't/won't shoot, but I can still see.   

I reached the limit at somepoint. I have a lot more done though. Where should I post it? Should I make another submission or what?

But in hardcore, it'd be just like real life.  
No speeding, and if you crash your car you are either fined or arrested if its your fault.

The magic criminal: When doing one of the vigilante side missions, I was intercepting a gang in star junction. They were in an alley, just behind the chocolate fountain. I drove pretty rough through traffic hitting several cars. I hid behind the chocolate fountain as the crooks fired at me. I heard some commotion behind me but thought nothing of it. I lined up my pistol with one of the guy's heads and was about to take a shot, when a taxi landed on me upside down, crushing me. The driver and passenger mocked me as they climbed out in black and white slow motion. 

The Ghost Rider: Driving down a road on a new bike I had just stolen, I noticed an old man, on an even cooler bike. For some reason I decided to follow him as he pulled into a car park. I got off my bike as he stopped on his, and began walking towards him. He got off his bike, but just as he did this the camera moved as I walked and a tree blocked my view of him, but only for a brief moment. As it re positioned itself, the old man was gone. Vanished from thin air. He couldn't have walked away that fast and I was close enough for him not to despawn. 

The hobo troll: During another vigilante mission I was sneaking up on a gang in an alley. They had their backs turned to me, so I pulled out a rocket launcher and aimed. But as soon as I did, a homeless guy laying on the floor next to me immediately shouted ""HE'S GOT A WEAPON!"" in a very comical manner. The gang turned around and pumped me full of lead, but not before I sent them packing to Hades with an RPG. I popped a cap in that filthy bum's bum soon after. 

The smart guys: Near the swingset of doom, I was starting fights with black guys in hopes they would pull a gun out and have a firefight with police. I hit one of their cars, 2 got out and hit me. A cop began approaching, so the unarmed one ran to the cop, so the cop arrests him, and turns his back to the other one. The armed one proceeds to pull out a mini uz and whack the cop in the back of the head then making him swiss cheese.He began shooting me again so I dailed 911 and had the cops take care of him. His buddy was taken out by two cops on the floor, while his friend took down three other officers before dying. 

The Crazy Russian: I got in a fight with a russian gangster, when 2 cops got involved. I hit behind a dumpster watching the battle. A cop ran towards him when the gangster blasted him in the face with his pump action shotgun. The cop wasn't dead, as he was calling for help on the floor. The gangster started walking away, when he slowly turned around, walked up to the cop and blasted him one last time, killing him. The cop's friend was killed by another gangster with a uzi. The guy with the shotgun came after me, so I blasted his kneecaps and kicked him until he died.

Anything with gibbing would be cool too, but I sort of doubt that exists.

Lastly, anything to make weapons sound even more badass would be welcome, although not necessary.

I wouldn't come here and ask, but the two mod DBs I've found are horribly organized and the extent of reviews for mods is people saying ""cool"" or ""faggot"". So I come here, humbly asking for any mods you've used in the past."	t5_2ra77	True

But there is a great new system in that game called something like ""Glass Box"". This engine, allows each individual person in a city to be their own person. You can follow a doctor to and from the hospital, when they go shopping, etc etc. It adds a whole new level to the environment. 

One of my favorite things to do in GTA growing up was to try and act like a normal person every now and then, or to follow people around and see what's going on around the city. How amazing would it be, if you could pick ANY pedestrian, and follow them around. You follow them, they go out and get food, go on a date, go home, go to work...what ever people do on their spare time. Now imagine a darker side of that. You can follow someone down an alley and watch a drug deal, or follow someone to a gang war/someone else getting beat up.

I don't think this were be a very demanding task in terms of computer power. You only have to attribute these new ped details to the peds on screen. Multiple peds can have the same thing in mind. There is no need to keep track of relationships or motivation. The player will make that up. Or the peds need to do is know where they are going, and what they are doing there when they arrive.

I think this would add an amazing new level of dynamic activity around the city and make the environment far more immersible. Just something that came to mind."	t5_2ra77	True

Zit: if you like a song and want to know what it's called, dial 948-555-0100. This is the number for Zit who will text you the name of the song. 

Action camera angle lock: on the action camera angle (The one that follows you in a helicopter or a pursuing police car etc) hold the right stick down for about 5 seconds on the angle you like, and it will lock you to that angle. 
911: Dial 911 and you can call the police, ambulance or fire department. 

Police department database: Go on the in game Internet, and on the homepage you will see the Liberty tree. Click on it and you will see an ad for crime zones, click on it and you will be on the lcpd website. Scroll to the bottom and click on the link saying database. On it is info on almost all the characters in the game! 
Advanced boat controls: when turning a boat, hold RB and it will turn alot quicker. Also hold the LS stick up or down, depending on which way you want the boat to pitch. 
Statue of happiness Easter egg: fly to the statue of happiness, and land on the level where there are 4 doors, one on each side. Go to the door that says ""No hidden content this way"" and go through it. Climb the ladder and you will see the beating heart of the statue. 
Quick travel: If you're fed up and want to get somewhere with no hassle, hail a cab (LB) get in as a passenger (hold y) and set a waypoint to where you want to go. Select the waypoint in the cab and press A to quick travel there.
Balaclava (Niko only): After completing the mission Three leaf clover, go to your wardrobe and go to hats. Keep scrolling through until you see the balaclava, then select it and wear it!
That's all I can think of for now. I know it was a long list but I could'nt keep it any shorter than I did. Thanks for reading!

And because you can't save manually, and auto saves are few and far between, I always end up in that same spot, and everything's just a bit... dull.

I'm sure it gets better the more you play (obviously) but I don't always have a lot of time in a week to play a game, so when I do I prefer to not have to buy pants or go bowling with some girl.

So I bought EFLC today and started playing The Lost and The Damned, and it's *awesome!*  Instant action, tons of fun, no waiting or going on dates.

However, I stopped playing 40 minutes in because I became afraid that I would miss out on something because I haven't played GTA IV, and I heard the plots intersect.

Can anyone give me info on this?

Thanks!

With GTA V release date closing in I thought it would be a nice to replay GTA 4, just to get back into the genre I guess.
Yesterday I was playing some multiplayer and I tried to get as many cops as  possible to chase me, and some other players were doing the same. We all had a 5 star wanted levels so A LOT of cops were spawning. I also noticed there were more helicopters than in singleplayer (In singleplayer the max is 2 helicopters at the same time I think).
So here is my question: if all (32) players have a 6 star wanted-level will there be spawning 64 helicopters and hundreds of cops? Or is there some sort of cap to the amount of cops that can spawn?

Has anyone ever tried this? I searched youtube but couldn't really find anything.

I have had the same experience with all the GTA games that i have played and was curious as to whether or not anyone else here on this subreddit did it. I loved the missions and the story of course, but my favorite activity was just causing random chaos as is always fun in gta. However, above all, I loved to make long chaotic and bloody last stands against the police. I would usually attain enough stars to have swat on me, then i would back myself into a corner of a building and hold out until i was killed. Originally, i cheated weapons into the game for these last stands like rocket launchers, grenades, assault rifes etc. But then i started giving myself a challenge by limiting myself to only guns i pick up off of the dead. Eventually, after much bloodshed, the police would kill me and i would just do it again. I would do this for hours and thought it was one of the most exhilerating parts of the game. I was wondering if anyone did anything similar. I know that im probably not the only person out there, but i was curious as to what others did differently. "	t5_2ra77	True

When i'm in game independence FM does not play my custom music only radio advertisements. I made a playlist(**general collection of songs in a folder on my pc. NO DRM**) of about 15 or so songs to play through the radio station all mp3 format. 

After putting them in the appropriate files and running a full scan, quick scan, turning on/off autoscan, changing file names, trying wma files, trying wav files, trying less songs, trying more, putting the files directly in the folder, adding shortcuts to the song folder, adding shortcuts to each individual file, choosing sequential/shuffle/radio, restarting the game and my pc and nothing has worked. 

There are dozens of people complaining about the same problems on different forums but none of the threads were solved or none of the solutions have helped me. Surely someone has had this problem here and possibly fixed it?

~~EDIT:Thanks for the immediate downvote asshole. I just wanted help.~~ &lt;Was being a bit of a dick here.

for the ones who want a nice cover for itunes, I made one just for you http://imgur.com/QRID0

I allready explained how to upload a cover to itunes in my last post but here is it again:
to add it to the album click the album once (not twice, dont open it ) then press ctrl i (cmd i if you have a mac) then click yes on the warning page. enable artwork field, now drag the cover directly on the artwork panel. or click it twice and select the cover and select 'open'

it should look like this: http://imgur.com/QSytI

I took Michelle on a date to the Steinway beer garden. Parallel parked my car nicely out front, right behind another car--must be okay to park here. After a few drinks, I stumble out all drunk ass and the car is gone. Walk around the corner and still can't find it.

Damn, did I forget where I parked it? Did it get jacked? It is starting to get dark, and this neighborhood is kind of sketchy. Walk to the subway station and it's closed. I doubt she'd be okay with me jacking a car (on our last date I got in a fist fight with some guy who made a crude comment to her and she flipped out and ditched me). I don't know how to call a cab, so, finally sobered up, we end up walking/running all the way to her place...

She almost gets run over a couple of times, but I finally get her home. After a 6+ hour nightmare date, no way am I going for a goodnight kiss.

If anyone knows of a fix I'd appreciate the help!

edit: Another issue is the camera. It won't stop moving. It keeps spinning clockwise around CJ and I have no idea why.


Second edit: I fixed the start issue. By creating a custom controller profile in Motioninjoy I set start as a keystroke, rather than a button. So by setting it to Keystroke &gt; Escape, it makes the game think that Start is Escape.



**Grand Theft Edit III:** Fixed all the issues I had after a lot of Googling. 

For anyone curious who wants to do it themselves, I created a custom profile and after changing all settings to [match this](http://i.imgur.com/dw4H0.png) everything is working fine.

I just got some chills when I realized some of the morals GTA actually instills in you. For instance, you get all this money, ungodly piles of fucking cash and what do you do with it? Look at Niko at the end of 4, he's nearly a millionaire or actually a millionaire if you played right but he's lost everything that he's ever truly cared about. Roman is dead, his mother is still in his homeland, every woman that he's loved has betrayed him, and revenge, his only motivator, only further dissatisfied him. But at least he's rich. Maybe that's what GTA is about. You start out somewhat morally rich and as your wealth increases, you become morally poor. Media bashes GTA because of the indiscriminate violence that can be committed against civilians, but really, those are purely your choices. No one forces you to kill the innocent. Instead of people looking to Rockstar for blame, they should look within themselves and realize that these games don't make monsters, we do.	t5_2ra77	True

Basically, playing GTA IV, or any GTA on a very difficult way.

The rules:

1 - You can only use fists, melee weapon, pistols and body armor. Grenades and Molotovs also are allowed. Anything else is banned unless required by a mission: you have to get rid of it later.

2 - You can only run from the police on foot. You can try to use a car, but you need to get rid of it before getting out of the flashing zone, unless it is absolutely required (IE: During missions). Pay'n Spray is only allowed to repair cars. You can also only drive up to 50% out of the flashing zone. After it, abandon the vehicle and go on foot.

3 - You have only three lives. Get wasted three times, and you have to start over. You can get busted as much as you want, through.

4 - Only Little Jacob and the gun stores can be used to obtain guns. No gun spawn bullshit.

I'm playing with no Radar or HUD, it adds a new element to the game. The city's atmosphere is so real. I constantly hear new conversations while walking down the street. 

Also some new random events I never saw before like an old guy just died in his car in the middle of the road for no obvious reason. 

Also I walked down an alley way across from Romans cab depot and two random guys who were in the alley started telling me to go back to where I came from. Then they both attacked me, one had a knife. It was crazy. Has anyone else had any of this stuff happen to them?"	t5_2ra77	True

1375508376.0	1jm37o	I propose a challenge in GTA 4 to wait for GTA 5	HighClassPenguin	26	9	16	"So I am not sure if many know about this sort of gametype thing that I have a lot of fun doing but basically it is this. You Go to the very tip top of Alderny where you usually spawn in party mode, get a six star, and simply run all the way to Dukes airport. Only two rules are 

1.You can't swim to the airport(Algonquin park unincluded)

2.You can't get in a vehicle at all, only run.

I'm not sure if it is just me that finds enjoyment out of this, or even if a lot of people even know about it for that matter but it is simple as that.
Well, it doesn't have to be. the idea is to get from one part of the map to the other in a hard difficulty. So it would be smart to throw in some things to make it harder because the challenge of six stars running and gunning isn't really that hard. Anyone can do it. But maybe you can throw in some friends who try to kill you on the way. Or maybe try to do the run with only a pistol, or a shotgun, or without body armor, or try to kill all police that come your way, or even try to destroy every police vehicle before moving on should make it harder. Anything to make it a bit more challenging. Hopefully you guys enjoy this simple idea as much as I do, if you decide to try it out anyways, or already have."	t5_2ra77	True

This cut version was realeased in Germany and even though I live in Switzerland, Steam refuses to give me the uncut version, even after contacting support.


Is there a way to get the uncut version on Steam? I wanted to pick up Vice City for speed running and need the proper version.


I heard that when replacing the VC exe from an uncut game with the cut exe, would solve this problem. Is that true? Would any of you be so kind and help me out here?

Today this douche comes up to me after I'd just been driving around doing nothing and starts shooting me. That's all fine, I get out and we have a bit of a shootout until I notice he isn't being injured. Then I suddenly catch fire and die. I message him saying that he should just play normally and stop ruining peoples fun. Next thing I know I can't move and my character starts flying around and dying all the time. I had to leave the game which I had been enjoying with all the other random people until this ass showed up :/ 

Here's a video of what was happening: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18RtlDQASqU

Sorry about crappy phone quality. I'm also guessing it's pretty simple to do since so many are doing it now. Anyone here try their hand at these mods before? 

I can't wait even more for GTA5 now since 4 online has been ruined like this! 



  
Also to add to this post: We should have a ""reddit server"" type free game to play on with others from here. I don't really have any friends who play GTA online anymore and it'd be cool for us to get a group going for those of us who don't want to play public modded matches anymore! "	t5_2ra77	True
