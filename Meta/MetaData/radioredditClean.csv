1337126764.0	tp3ej	radio reddit is at risk of shutting down. We need your help. 	HarryMuffin	166	16	43	"So here’s the scoop. I apologize that it will be long winded, and I hate making posts like these but it is necessary at this point.  

As you probably know, [radio reddit](http://radioreddit.com) is a community founded, funded, and operated project. We allow independent reddit musicians to upload their music, and we play it on our streams while users vote on the songs. All for free. More popular songs are played more and vice versa. We also have [talk radio](http://radioreddit.com/listen/#talk) for non music lovers. On the operational side of things, we have for the most part two people. Octatone, and myself (we still get tons of help from everyone).  We do what we do 100% as volunteers and have never received any financial compensation (in fact we started with our own money).  

That being said we are currently hurting very badly right now as far as project funding goes.  At first it was easy and we just covered it out of pocket for the fun of it.  Over the past few years our project has grown exponentially in size causing of course, increased costs.  We’ve outgrown multiple servers and bandwidth agreements.  Luckily we’ve had the nice guys over at [Voxel](http://voxel.net) take care of us by giving us a good rate, but a dedicated server is not exactly cheap even with the discounts. The bottom line is that we currently are closing in on having 0 operational revenue and this is we, as lovers of independent music and musicians, asking for help.  

It seems only fair to give a rundown of our current costs. We’ve always been transparent about our operations.  

Per month we currently pay between $100 - $150 USD per month for our main server that runs our transcoding and website. The fluctuation is because sometimes we have overages.  As it stands this is our only monthly recurring cost, however we have a number of yearly costs to keep ourselves legit, and our artists and ourselves protected.  

This includes: 

* $100 for DMCA compliance
* $350 or so to make us a legal entity
* $100 or so for business registrations
* $46 quarterly for a PO Box
* $99 yearly for an apple dev account to sell the iphone apps (of which we are currently lapsed)
* Various nickel and diming throughout the year

This comes to roughly $2,000 USD per year.

Our income comes in the form of:

* Ad revenue (you’d be surprised how little we make from this. I think last month we did about 15 bucks. Some months we do only a few dollars
* [Sponsorships from listeners](http://radioreddit.com/sponsor)
* Revenue from iphone apps (of which we still owe a percentage of to the awesome developer, and will pay off, mind you)

I’m trying really hard to keep this from being a begging post, because that is not the intent. We will get through this. As of this month we are about $120 dollars behind to have this month’s server cost covered and our apple developer account reinstated.  

Here is how you can help:  

* You can put a dollar or two towards a radio reddit sponsorship
* You can help us get the word out there. We need to let people outside of reddit know what we are doing for independent musicians. 
* You can come up with a way to volunteer. We need help with various things, from social media people to street team coordinators, etc.  We’ve come this far on this foundation.
* Ideas. We love ideas. Have a good one? Join with us and let's make it happen.   

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. We feel that independent musicians need to be heard.  They need feedback and support just like everyone else. We think that listeners need to be in control of what they hear. Don’t like a song? Downvote it. Our stream will adapt and you’ll hear less of it. If you like what we’re trying to accomplish, please consider giving us a helping hand. To all of those that say radio reddit is ""shitty"" and ""sucks"", we encourage you to begin voting on what you don't like to build the ultimate stream that is a reflection of what everyone as a whole likes hearing. 

If you are not familiar as a listener, please [check out the random stream](http://radioreddit.com/listen/#random).

All of our hard work over the past few months is paying off.  We have been contacted by the site admins of Reddit who have offered to give us sponsored ad space and promote us officially.  This opens up more opportunity and will help get our music heard on a larger scale. Thanks to everyone so far that has helped on this project.  A few things that have been mentioned is the possibility of having Radio Reddit blast at the global meetups, merch, among some really cool other brainstormy things. So if you have any ideas on what we can do to promote Radio Reddit as related to this community as a whole, let em rip. 

A huge amount of thanks go out to hueypriest and the other Reddit admins for their show of support.

As many of you know we started, and have always run as a group of volunteers (two of us, now three of us plus our volunteer app devs) from /r/wearethemusicmakers.  We've never made any money personally, and in fact have put a lot of our own money into this project because we believe in it.  

We aren't exactly swimming in the money because people believe that we are funded by reddit or a private source.  In truth we are licensees of the reddit trademark and logo people reddit, inc. is just that awesome, and believes in what we are doing.  

That aside, We have a pretty good opportunity to make some money for our project without putting out a penny.  

[Goodjoe.com](http://goodjoe.com) has started selling the first round of Radio Reddit t-shirts to help benefit our project.  We were basically picked out as an project that they wanted to help support because of our cause.  After holding a design contest that got the designer a few hundred dollars plus a percentage of sales, we came to the agreement that we will be getting $2.00 per shirt.  

That is $2.00 per shirt that we can use to sustain and grow our project into what it is truly meant to be..the vision that we all have for it.  Believe me... it adds up quickly.  Ultimately our goal is to promote and empower independent artists and musicians, and the more server resources and ads we can put together, the closer we can get to that goal.

The shirts come in multple designs and multiple colors, as well as multiple shirt types.  The two designs are:

HarryMuffin	60	9	12	"Based on the overwhelmingly positive response that we received about he idea, we've decided to do ""Best of Radio Reddit"" compilations in the following manner:  

**Monthly downloadable packs.**  
The top 20 songs for the month will be included in this release. We are hoping to start providing album art, radio reddit fan art,  artist bios and notes, etc...  the intent will be a ""sponsor what you want"" approach. Since we don't want to sell the releases (it wouldn't be fair to the artist to not get their permission first) we encourage people that download the album to [kick us something](http://radioreddit.com/sponsor) to help with the costs of everything.  Additionally, the only songs included with these releases are ones that are set to ""download"" by the artists.  

**Yearly Best Of**  
This one will be a more involved and planned release.  We intend to sell these are hard copy cd's / thumb drives, as well as a download release.  All artists on this will have agreed to be on the album, and will get legal documents ensuring that they retain all rights, etc... This is something we want to do up nice. If it works, we'd like to start doing quarterly hard copy releases.  

If it all works out, it would be awesome to do like CMJ used to do (are the still around?). Release new sample tracks by upcoming artists along with a magazine that has a bio and pictures and such.  

We did a sample pack for July, without anything fancy, or correct formatting, just to see how people felt about the musical side of things. [You can download it here](http://radioreddit.com/?q=content/monthly-best-example).

For those of you who don't know about SOPA please [read up on the basics of it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act).  In a nutshell, SOPA would restructure the laws of the internet as well as the actions that can be taken against people that break these newly defined, and restrictive laws.  

We have a small voice but we want to start by joining to movement to transfer our domain from SOPA supporter Go Daddy.  While they have changed their point of view after everything hit the fan, I am not buying it.  

Let me lay out what radio reddit is. radio reddit is a free music service made by musicians that wanted like minded individuals' music to be heard. The few of us that run and develop things are unpaid volunteers that are not especially thrilled with the way the music industry is being run and where it is headed.  We feel that the listeners should be able to decide what should be heard by themselves and others. And we feel that musicians should in turn, have a fair chance to be heard. No payola, no bottom line, no sniffing coke on the mixing board while making a backroom deal (well for most of us). ** All music uploaded by radio reddit goes through a strict upload process that guarantees that the music is owned by the individual uploading it.** 

**Now let me explain where SOPA would be bad for radio reddit**  

Let me show an example that explains things in the most simplistic terms.  Say we have a user that uploads music to our [upload page](http://radioreddit.com/uploading). This user agrees to our terms of service that they are the copyright holder of this song and that they exclusively own the rights to broadcasting and give us permission to replay said song(s), or make such available for download.  According to SOPA, if this user is not telling the truth and uploads Britney Spears songs, we volunteers that run the website are now subject to a maximum of 5 years of prison for each 10 violations within six months. In essence we risk being heavily punished as well as our families, for having an opportunity for struggling musicians.  

This is only a small example of the harm that this bill can do. Not only independent projects like radio reddit, but other projects that fall under open source, indie game development, etc etc... The damage would be widespread. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm on a soap box (sopa box?) and what I'm saying here doesn't necessarily fall under radio reddit's official stand, but I think that our side of the story needs to be heard.

Please help build the list of links here and I will edit them.  

tl;dr: I don't think it's a great idea if we let our parents make the laws of the internet. That would be like us making the rules of significant parts of their generation that we just don't understand.

We are a small group of volunteers that run and operate the Radio Reddit platform.  

Radio Reddit was founded in 2009 by users of /r/wearethemusicmakers.  We operate the website http://radioreddit.com which allows reddit based artists and bands to upload their music to be heard by the masses in the forms of radio streams, downloads, mobile apps, and on demand plays for free. In other words, we are not reddit, though we are officially recognized.  We do this for the love of music. 

We give artists and bands a fair chance to be heard and recognized.  For example, we recently did a Best of Radio Reddit CD using the highest voted tracks for 2012, to raise funds along side with VH1 to help put music education back into the classroom environment. Just to stress again, we do not profit personally from this. We do this in our spare time despite families and full time jobs.  We pride ourselves on getting deserving artists heard as much as possible.  In addition to our base services, we offer Radio Reddit Live.  This allows bands to stream live using our system.  This also gives the ability for Live DJ’s to broadcast curated content, such as what we broadcast on Friday nights on our main stream. 

**How we work on the inside**

We used the reddit API's and available code to develop a system that tracks songs using [/r/radioreddit](/r/radioreddit) as well as matching entries in our own database that tracks reddit urls, artist names, genres, scores, tags, rr username, reddit username, plays, and on and on and on.  

Using these scores (i.e. upvotes that we track on reddit AND our database) we build a custom playlist for each of our music streams on the hour.  Higher voted songs have more of a chance of being played, and vice versa.  Eventually lower voted songs disappear altogether.  The majority of our website operations are automated (minus our custom approval queue program for uploads). 

Artists also have the ability to see how many times their songs have been listened to, downloaded, or rotated in the stream, along with timestamps.  

**Humble beginnings**  

When we started we literally had an ftp site and a computer in my living room broadcasting a single stream of randomized songs.  Now we have 3 servers in high end data centers across the world.  The first Radio Reddt broadcast literally involved me kicking off the event from a computer hooked to my TV while I was drinking beer.  We hit the max limit of listeners 10 minutes before the stream even started, and it snowballed from there.  

Talented individuals flocked towards the project and help build a workable prototype pretty quick, notably octatone and JohnCub. [Here is a funny archive of the build process](http://web.archive.org/web/20091224130330/http://www.radioreddit.com/). We switched servers 5 times I believe before we got to where we are now because we kept outgrowing ourselves. reddit, Inc. has been there for us the whole time to help us grow.  From Keysersosa to Hueypriest to Jenakalif we've had support from the top since we began, despite us fearing a shut down message or scolding. Truly, reddit staff are awesome people. 

**Where is Radio Reddit headed?**  

An excellent question! I am glad you asked.  We are currently working on version 2.0.  It is going to take into account all of the things we’ve learned along the way.  We’ve gotten many critiques and praises and we’ve listened to every single one along the way.  

We plan on delivering a personalized user experience for each listener that allows them to have the option of a Pandora type experience, a custom playlist type, or music discovery service that uses voting habits and likes and dislikes.  

We are currently rebuilding from scratch in Python over Pyramid.  We have some pretty solid mockups that I will post shortly.  Also, if you are a Python dev and want to join into the fun (which will all be open sourced) toss an email over to team@radioreddit.com  

In addition to the website changes we plan on releasing more “Best Of Radio Reddit” CDs and downloadable albums.  Our goal is to have a Radio Reddit Records where talented artists and musicians can publish albums on the cheap and distribute to a widespread audience.

1329943602.0	q1exw	radio reddit, /r/300songs, and Grooveshark are joining forces. We are kicking things off with a new project and a contest that will give the winner a huge promotional opportunity. 	HarryMuffin	52	9	17	"Edit: The deadline for idea submissions is next Thursday, March 1st. 

radio reddit, [/r/300songs](/r/300songs), and [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com) are joining forces to empower you, the hardworking independent musicians of reddit.  Our first project together will be collaborating on the [/r/300songs](/r/300songs) project.* In a nutshell, communication and collaboration will occur on /r/300Songs, uploading and voting will occur on radioreddit.com, and streaming/downloading/promotion will take place on Grooveshark.  

That said, all song submissions for this project must be uploaded to radioreddit.com.  When you upload your song, simply add “300songs” as a tag on the upload form. This will allow your song to be identified easily. The end goal is to have an easy way to vote and listen to songs, as well a simple way to implement an exclusive radio stream that will get you more exposure.

**But wait, there's more!**

Staying true to our democratic roots, we’re kicking off a contest to let you guys contribute ideas for our homepage takeover on Grooveshark.  The winning idea will receive a 100,000 play radio campaign on Grooveshark, 100,000 banner impressions, and featured placement in the Explore section which gets over 1 million views per week.


**What you need to know to contribute** 

* The overarching theme of our campaign is: democracy in music.   
* You can view examples of other homepage takeovers by going here: http://grooveshark.com/#/themes.    

We need you to submit two things in your post:

**1. Design concept:** what images, graphics, logos, videos, links, do you propose the takeover includes?  
**2. Messaging/copy:** what taglines or calls-to-action do you think we should include?  
  
  
  
**tl;dr:** radio reddit, /r/300songs, and Grooveshark are joining forces. There will be an awesome contest for artists and bands. All /r/300songs submissions will now be uploaded to radioreddit.com

**For the un-initiated, the 300 songs project is a Reddit community that holds a monthly contest for musicians to showcase their original songs. Every month artists collaborate on &amp; submit their original songs and the community votes on their favorite tracks. The top 12 tracks are then compiled and released as an album."	t5_2rb6n	True

We can take the highest voted tracks for each month (that allow downloads) and release them in a .zip file.  We are thinking about including other things like album art, etc...  

[Here is a downloadable example](http://radioreddit.com/?q=content/monthly-best-example) of the top voted songs for July.  This is just an example, and not an actual release, so don't read too much into it.  

The thought would be to lead this into a ""Best of"" for the year that is released physically, and who knows... maybe even have a Radio Reddit Records label. 

Edit:  Perhaps we can tie this to our ""sponsorships"" on a pay what you want model.  It's a sensitive issue for us to ""sell"" such a thing without each artist's permissions, so we don't want to do that.  Maybe we can include something on the download page. Thoughts?"	t5_2rb6n	True

1346840608.0	zdxue	If you download a track from Radio Reddit, please upvote or submit it.	mage_g4	47	9	4	"When looking at my song stats, I noticed a discrepancy between downloads and votes. Take one of my tracks as an example:

**Play Stats**

Artist | Title | Plays | Reddit Score
:--|:--|:--:|:--:
Without Sanity | Virtue and Reward | 14 | 1

**Download Stats**
  
Artist | Title | Downloads
:--|:--|:--:|
Without Sanity | Virtue and Reward | 5

As you can see, this track has had 5 downloads but only one upvote. [Here's the link to the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/radioreddit/comments/x4rgn/virtue_and_reward_by_without_sanity_mage_g4/) and from that we can see it has had two upvotes and one down. Given that it has been downloaded 5 times, it should have at least 5 upvotes.

I'm not saying this because I personally want more upvotes (although I do, of course) but because if you liked a song enough to download it, it's only fair that you give it an upvote or submit it, if it has not yet been submitted. The artists who provide the music that makes Radio Reddit so brilliant work hard on their music and if they're kind enough to give it away for free, it's only fair that we give the track an upvote when we download it.

The [Radio Reddit Charts](http://radioreddit.com/?q=charts) rely on upvotes to ascertain what tracks are most popular and with the the advent of The Radio Reddit Best Of, it's more important than ever that we vote on the songs we hear.

Currently we have the ability to broadcast redditor’s live performances, but we want to open up the discussion of us stepping it up a notch.

We would like to continue our expansion and to make radioreddit's live@ more accessible to our artists and listeners. For the moment we are calling it RadioReddit Live@OTR...On The Road.

What's different about Live@OTR? Simply put we will be bringing recording/streaming equipment to those artists and bands who wish to perform live on RadioReddit. This way we can cover the streaming/recording technicalities and equipment so that the artist/band can focus on their performance. We have had a few artists who have performed live on RadioReddit already, and although there were technical difficulties to overcome, all performances were successful.

We realize that trying to handle technical setup, sound checks, and quality control for live performances can be extremely stressful and also quite improbable. Our goal is to provide our own independent system and sound tech so that the artist only remains concerned with his own set and performance.

Unfortunately for now,  routes and destinations will be dependent on a completely unrelated circumstance with little room for detours, but I will be carrying the equipment with me at all times and I will be posting my routes and destinations with daily updates as I wind my way through the interstates. With a little luck and some help from the universe we hope that my route takes us near your show.  It will take huge amounts of communication by all parties, but we want to come see your show and stream it live on Radio Reddit. If this plan is successful we are looking at getting dedicated equipment and the funds and means to go where the show is.

Tell us what you think, good or bad. We are trying to brainstorm as a community to offer new services that are of benefit to everyone."	t5_2rb6n	True

1309986884.0	iig13	We'd like to move into the next phase of radio reddit: compensating artists. 	HarryMuffin	36	3	8	"As you may or may not know, our original intent with radio reddit was to have independent musicians heard and compensated outside of the traditional record label model.  We've always thought that the musicians and the listeners should come first as they are the masters of their works, and they know what they want to hear.  Since we started very small and very humbly as a group of reddit community members we never actually had a solid foundation on how to go about getting monetary compensation for artists on radio reddit (especially since we are just now able to cover our server bills).  We'd like to propose some ideas for discussion to see what you think and to get input and ideas so that we can start to move into the next phase of radio reddit: Changing the way people discover music and changing the way that artists have their music distributed.  

The most interesting idea that is on the table is about having ""Best Of"" compilation albums in the form of lossless torrents and hard copy professionally printed CD's. Each compilation would feature the highest voted songs of each variable (i.e. 2011,  electronic, etc).  The thought is to have a [kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) project that will release a torrent of the compilation once X amount of dollars are pledged.  Those who pledge over a certain amount will also have a hard copy CD sent to them.  

**Here's the cool part**:  We'd like to have all of the artists on each compilation compensated with a yet to be determined percentage of the income from these projects. We'd like this to be the start and foundation of where we are going with this whole thing as far as artist compensation.  

Of course all of this would be pending approval from reddit.com's licensing, so it may be something that never happens, or something that is highly praised. This is really just a brain storming session.

Currently (as of this posting) there are 4,060 songs in rotation created by 1,298 artists (1,155 redditors - some redditors have multiple bands, projects they are involved with) representing 133 different genres.


The most upvoted song has a score of 448.
The most downvoted song has a score of -16.


The total average positive score (out of 1,613 submitted songs) is 6 with 288 songs in rotation greater than or equal to that average (7%); songs with above average scores (for their particular genre) have a higher probability of being played on the stream during a genre block.  The threshold (average positive score) is much higher per genre.


The average negative score is -2 with 74 songs less than or equal to that average (songs with -10 or lower are excluded from rotation).


1613 songs (40%) in rotation have been submitted to /r/radioreddit for votes.  2447 songs (60%) in rotation have not been submitted for votes.


This month there were over 10,000 downloads and song plays on http://radioreddit.com (this is site interaction, song previews and downloads - not plays on the live streams).


Our daily listenership on the live streams now peaks at over 50 listeners each day with hourly averages consistently around 30.  A year ago we had peaks of 5-10 listeners each day.

&gt;The VH1 Save The Music Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring instrumental music education in America's public schools, and raising awareness about the importance of music as part of each child's complete education. Since its inception in 1997, the VH1 Save The Music Foundation has provided $48 million in new musical instruments to 1,800 public schools in more than 100 cities around the country, impacting the lives of over 1.8 million children.  

We have approached the charity about our desire to support such a project, and were promptly ""approved"" and provided with logos and banners to help drive the project.  

As always, we will run this in a transparent fashion and we will run any major decisions by all artists involved in the ""Best Of"" to make sure that they are OK with this.  We plan to use an 80/20 model that give 80 percent of revenue to the charity and 20 percent back into our project (no one on our side profits as an individual).

* A website that will at least display title and artist of the currently playing song along with a download link, a link to the artist's website and/or Reddit handle, and the ability to up/downvote the song.  I'd give bonus points for a Reddit-like discussion thread displayed for the current song, too.  Put that info in an RSS feed, too.
* A web interface for uploading MP3's and providing that information.
* Dedicated shows, at least to the most popular music based on votes and music uploaded within the last 24-72 hours.  
* Perhaps a show discussing topics from /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers
* A bot that allows IRC chatters at our channel to upvote/downvote music, as well as retrieve current song info (title, artist, artist website, upvotes, downvotes).

Due to the [TIME](http://techland.time.com/2012/09/18/50-best-websites-2012/?slide=radio-reddit#radio-reddit) article, and a /r/music post about it being very popular, we received a huge amount of traffic to our site and streams over the past 24 hours.  

This has caused our server to be verrrrrryyyy slowwww.  This is because our single server is our web server, our database server, our stream server, and our encoding server all at the same time.  

We've done over 20,000 page views, which by itself isn't huge, but it is with a low powered server that is doing a LOT. 

Luckily Internap has stepped up and offered to upgrade our server on the cheap. This will occur over the next 24-48 hours and will fix issues when we have traffic spikes, and will also allow us to offer more services.  

Our current setup is like this:

* Virtual server
* 4GB of Memory
* 2 cores
* 125GB of SAN storage

In the past few days there have been a large number of posts that link to Soundcloud and other sources, using the same title format as radio reddit tracks.  This is completely understandable, and obviously a misunderstanding, but I wanted to let our new users know about submitting to radio reddit.  

Each of the tracks that you see on /r/radioreddit have been uploaded to radioreddit.com via [our upload form](http://radioreddit.com/uploading).  Once they are uploaded and approved there, users can submit and vote on them while listening to our streams, or browsing our website, and they in turn, become links in our subreddit.  

Once they are links in our subreddit, our streams take the voting into account. Each hour, our algorithm takes these votes and builds the new stream programming.  More popular songs rise to the top, less popular songs are lowered and eventually phased out.  

I hope that clears up a bit of what is going on around here.  I don't want anyone to be offended when their song is deleted from the subreddit (even if it is great!)  

With this, know that the more votes we get, the better the stream will be. Don't be afraid to submit!  

Also: We encourage you to discuss, collaborate, and help come up with ideas in this subreddit. We don't want it to be exclusively for song posts. "	t5_2rb6n	True

Just to throw it out there, I made a quick mock up (I'm not a graphic artist, don't bash me) to see if this is something you'd like us to start leaning towards.  Please feel free to make your own mockups of what you'd like to see RR look like.  Of course keep in mind server resources are always an issue, but it looks like that may not be a problem in the future if we keep doing what we're doing.

1. There are two songs that have been ""PENDING APPROVAL"" for over a year now.

2. There is an artist I would like to delete entirely to clean up my page because I accidentally misspelled the name on my first try. I release music under several different names and have had a lot of bands in the past.

3. There are some songs that I've deleted but are still in the ""My Songs"" section, marked as ""DELETED"" but I'd really like to remove them entirely.

4. I've gotten thousands of plays and hundreds of downloads but still haven't reached the 50 point limit to upload more than 25 tracks. Is there anyway around this or do I need to start deleting songs.

So my questions are, can I solve these problems and if I or other artists have similar problems in the future, what are the steps we need to take to have more control of our ""My Artist Profile"" and ""My Songs"" pages on radioreddit.com."	t5_2rb6n	True

1285525518.0	dj5e5	radio reddit has many things going on. Here are the latest updates. 	HarryMuffin	31	6	6	"Quite a bit has happened lately with radio reddit.  Here are the latest updates of what is going on:  

* The first radio reddit t-shirt is coming to help fund our growing server requirements.  It is  designed by the awesome [licenseplate](http://www.reddit.com/user/licenseplate) (the person that made the RedditGifts and Reddit meme poster) and will be available VERY soon.  

* Our playlist is almost up to 3,000 songs.  This is definitely a wonderful start for the first year of this project.  New songs are being uploaded daily by reddit artists and bands so there is always something new.  

* Our new relay servers are up that were generously donated by [Radixcloud](http://www.radixcloud.com) and [Exoware](http://www.exoware.net).  Now we can support tons of listeners world-wide. (not to be confused with our main server, that does the majority of the work.  

* The stream is quite self-sufficient now.  Songs that get x amounts of downvotes are ranked lower and thus receive less time in the streams. Songs that get higher amounts of upvotes are given higher playing priorities.  All songs remain available for voting regardless of status.  

* A second stream is happening for Talk radio reddit.  We have a few reddit users lined up to do hour long talk shows for the stream.  If you are interested, please send a demo to admin@radioreddit.com  The backend is already complete, we just need broadcasters and content.  

Please understand this project is just a few of us that are reddit users and all of our funding comes from donations.  If we are to keep this going we all need to work together. If you enjoy it let us know. If you don't, let us know what we can do better.  Before you send a message about using the reddit name, etc., the reddit admins are aware of all of this and we clear everything by them first.

1345484434.0	yj6yb	Important Radio Reddit news.  Crowd sourcing, Best Of's, and changes in the upload process.	HarryMuffin	38	11	9	"Radio Reddit has grown exponentially in the past 4 months.  Our visitors, downloads, and individual track streaming has grown by a large margin.

With this we've had a large increase in bandwidth usage which has resulted in large overages in our bill for FOUR out of the last four months.  Here is a breakdown of our dedicated server costs plus overages for the past four months:  

&gt;05/12 - 119.60  
&gt;06/12 - 141.00  
&gt;07/12 - 159.60  
&gt;08/12 - 178.00  

It is easy to see where this is headed. 

***[We have come up with a way to offset these rising costs, while benefiting musicians and listeners](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/radio-reddit-best-of-august-release)*** 

reddit Inc has recently partnered with Crowdtilt.com and we will be using them to raise funds for our new ""Best of Radio Reddit"" monthly releases. The releases will feature all of the top voted songs of the month from [our charts](http://radioreddit.com/charts). Here's the plan:

We will be trying to raise a total of $250.00 for the Best of Radio Reddit August Edition. This will cover the increased cost to host these downloads.  Those who make a $10.00 (or more) contribution will receive a lossless audio version of the release, as well as Radio Reddit vinyl stickers.  The release will also be available to the rest of the world in 128kbps Mp3.  If you don't know how Crowdtilt works, it is pretty simple.  Contributions are put towards the project, and once the project meets its goal, it ""tilts"" and the contributors are charged.  If the project does not tilt, then nothing is charged.

If this all works out we will try something similar with a long-term goal and more perks for contributors.  

**Here is the important part for all RR musicians.**  On your ""My Songs"" page you will now see an ""OPT-IN"" button. This is you giving us consent to release all of your songs as part of the Best Ofs.  You will also see a button on each song's edit page allowing the same, but only for individual tracks.  We will not include songs that are not opted in.  Additionally you will have the option on the upload page to make this choice.  

**[You can contribute and view our Crowdtilt page here.](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/radio-reddit-best-of-august-release)**  Please help us in our growth and our plan for world music domination.

Time to step it up a notch.	pextris	27	4	19	"Here is the plan:  We plan on releasing a Radio Reddit 2.0 platform.  As it stands currently, Radio Reddit is a HIGHLY modified version of Drupal that integrates with reddit's open source code to provide voting capabilities.  The votes are stored in our database and we have custom software built by Octatone that builds our playlists on the hour based on these voting habits.  

Where we want to be:  

We are looking at rewriting the Radio Reddit system in Python using Pyramid as a base framework.  We are working on a player that will allow for individual user experiences and the ability for users to skip through songs, and have songs queued up that match their tastes and voting habits.  

Sweet you say!  Well yes, but we are literally One-three people MAX at any given moment to do dev, PR, legal, business, operations, artists relations, AND we have family and day jobs.  This is where you come in!  

We are looking to make Radio Reddit 2.0 an open source project and we need Python and other developers that want to contribute.  Our intention is to build the ultimate multimedia delivery system that is a huge asset for artists, listeners, and the reddit community as a whole.  In short, we want to change the music industry by making it open and available at every level of the concept.  

I'm posting this just to see what kind of comments come along.  We plan on using the GIT system to make this happen, and we want to see if anyone is interested. "	t5_2rb6n	True

HarryMuffin	28	5	16	"Unless we can get a tidbit of help.  As you may or may not know, radio reddit is a project started and maintained by volunteers that have day jobs.  Our server costs aren't too terrible, but they are there nonetheless at about $100 per month. 

With our adsense account being cut because we ""insert generic violation page here""'d, we've lost our income source that kept us at an almost 0 balance.  

""Wait! How can I help?"" you say? Well we have a few options.  We have a [sponsor option](http://radioreddit.com/sponsor) that allows you to help us out via Google Checkout or Paypal, and we also have [Self Serve Ads](http://radioreddit.com/promote) that lets you promote your band/music/product/service/whatever starting at 10 bucks a month for unlimited impressions.  

Either way, please consider helping us out. Our costs aren't crazy, but we need help covering them.  Even .25 cents is a push towards the better.  

I'm trying to avoid the ""if you don't help us, we die and blah blah blah"" stuff here, and I really would just look goofy in a ""This is a personal appeal from HarryMuffin"" photo on our front page. Many people have already stepped up including [Stickerish.com that covered this month](http://stickerish.com/).  Either way, enjoy the music. These musicians need to be heard."	t5_2rb6n	True

If you would like to be acknowledged for your translation efforts, please send me an email at bryan@radioreddit.com. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again so much to everyone who has already helped with the translations!"	t5_2rb6n	True

Tracks in the subreddit won't play and the apps won't work.	pextris	27	2	13	"Always a fun thing to come home to after a long day at work.  I'm on top of it now and am working with Voxel to figure out the issue. I will keep everyone informed via this thread.  

**Edit 1**: Catastrophic drive failure.  Since we don't have physical access to the box (its in a data center in NYC) we are at the mercy of the crew there. Our last full back up is from this month, but worst case scenario we will end up about a week behind.. this always happens when you are in the middle of implementing a backup solution.  

Unfortunately I don't do this full time, so this is just the way it falls.  We are going to try to mount the original drive and retrieve data from today, but if not, we may lose a week or two.  Either way we may be out of commission for a day or two.  I will continue to update.

**Edit 2:** We have the old failed drive mounted. I am pulling ALL of our old data over to our new drive and it will probably be an overnight operation.  At least we'll have a full copy of our data. 

**Edit 3:** Data is moving over. We are going in the right direction.  

**Edit 4:**  Got much of the data back over but the drive went out again mid-copy.  At day job now and will work on it tonight. Will update. 

**Edit 5:** Drive is re-mounted, I'm getting mission critical stuff now via rsync.  

Data that is SAFE and retrieved and is up to date:  

* Our song catalogue (yay!)
* Web directory
* Database
* Home directories
* /etc
* crontab  

The web / cron / etc is back up.  Need to get the DB mounted correctly. "	t5_2rb6n	True

We're going to approach it differently this time around. 	pextris	27	7	3	"The first Best Of Radio Reddit release did great and we raised funds for it FAST. We did a very large number of downloads and lots of torrent movement. The [TIME article](http://techland.time.com/2012/09/18/50-best-websites-2012/#radio-reddit) definitely didn't hurt matters. We were able to get the music of reddit musicians out to the masses.

I think the novelty of our funding method wore out pretty quick, though. While it would be nice to distribute all of the music to a large audience for free, obviously no one can afford to have 0 income towards such projects because bandwidth and servers are not cheap.  This next ""Best Of"" will be a ""pay what you want"" release.  This means you can pay nothing, or a lot. 

When contacting the artists included, we were very up front and transparent with the fact that there would be money collected. The exact quote was: 

""Our main goal is to have your music heard by listeners. This ""Best Of"" download pack will help distribute your track to our fan base, and we are hoping to set a new standard for reddit based music distribution.  It is important that you understand that we take your rights very seriously.  By being a part of this compilation you retain all rights of your songs, artist name, and trademarks. We do plan on letting users donate (or not) any amount they'd like to help us with operational costs. We want to be up front with that so you're aware that the individuals that run Radio Reddit aren't profiting off of your music (we are volunteers).""  

Hopefully this is the right way to do things.  I think that it is very important to be transparent with this endeavor... after all, look what greed and manipulation has done to the state of main stream music today.  It would be nice to change that.

Congratulations radio redditor!  
   

The users have spoken by voting at http://radioreddit.com/charts . One of your tracks has been selected to be part of ""Radio Reddit'sBest Of"" release for the year 2012.  We would like to include you in this first annual release in a series of many. 

If you would like to participate, here is what we need from you by January 11th:    
* Please log into your account at http://radioreddit.com/?q=user/login  
* Go to your ""My Songs"" page at http://radioreddit.com/?q=my_songs  
* Edit your songs and mark them as ""Releasable""  

Respond to this e-mail if you want to participate and we will e-mail you a place to upload the track. We will need a lossless audio track in FLAC, WAV, or AIFF format.  
 
Our main goal is to have your music heard by listeners. This ""Best Of"" release will help distribute your track to our fan base, and we are hoping to set a new standard for reddit based music distribution and discovery.  It is important that you understand that we take your rights very seriously.  By being a part of this compilation you retain all rights of your songs, artist name, and trademarks. We do plan on distributing this in hard copy CD for hard copy release to help us with operational costs, and to give a portion of the proceeds to Vh1's Save The Music Campaign, which is fighting to put musical education back in the classroom. We also plan on distributing this in high quality downloadable formats.  We want to be up front with that so you're aware that the individuals that run Radio Reddit aren't profiting off of your music (we are volunteers), and that we cannot offer monetary compensation for artists (yet!).  

Please note that we are contacting the artists from the top 25 tracks as we know that not everyone will respond or want to be included. We will be including roughly 20 artists, in order of the highest votes, and who responds first.   

If you have any questions, you can reply to this e-mail.

We put a poll up to see how strongly everyone feels about the subject (not just redditors, but the others that find the site by other means).  Please let us know how you feel there, and in our thread.  

Should our direction change, we'd of course need to ask for help from the open source community, as well as those who can afford to toss in some server resources and such.  Right now it's literally two of us running things, so a change would take help.

Last week we put a few posts around reddit and on Google+ looking for people to volunteer for some positions that would help offload some work from octatone and I's workload (just to clarify we are also volunteers that have our own specialties that we'd like to focus on).  We received quite a few applications and every single one of them were by great people who were obviously highly motivated.  We had two guys whose submissions stood out and we'd like to introduce them:  

**Andrew**: radio reddit's new Social Networking Coordinator.  Andrew will be taking care of getting radio reddit's news around outside of reddit, and getting more non-reddit users involved in this project.  

**Aaron**: radio reddit's new Video Coordinator.  Aaron will be coordinating with reddit artists and bands to get their music videos and live performances onto our various video outlets (coming soon).  This will allow you to watch radio reddit as well as listen to it.  

So please welcome them aboard!  Also, this is not the end of it. Our foundation is solid now and we are planning on growing exponentially (as we always have).  This means we will have more positions open soon [(have an idea for one? Let us know!)](http://radioreddit.com/contact).

This is a preview of an iPhone app for radio reddit that I've been working on for some weeks now.
After many hours it's finally nearing version 1.0 and will soon be sent to Apple for approval. 
There are some minor things to fix before that, some testing to do, bugs to find and some paperwork.

In version 1.0 you can:

- listen to the different streams
- log in with your reddit account and upvote/downvote/submit songs
- bookmark songs (1)
- view the 20 latest songs you've heard on the radio (2)
- view the top 10 charts of all time/month/week and day (3)
- replay/play/vote on songs in 1, 2, 3 (in the bookmark list you can only play songs that have been enabled for downloading by the artist).
- use the remote on the headphones to play/pause/change stream
- on iOS4 there's multitasking and you can use the ""iPod controls"" in the multitask bar to play/pause/change stream.

The plan right now is to release two versions, one free and one paid - all depending on whether or not we get approval to license such a product.
The paid one is the one you saw in the video and the differences between that and the free version are the bookmarking/chart/recently played -features.
The paid version will also help support radio reddits costs for broadcasting.

I started programming this some weeks ago when I first discovered radio reddit. 
I wanted an iPhone app and it was only meant for my own pocket at first, but after talking to Octatone and Pextris things happened and here we are. 
I'm quite thrilled and really, really, hope people will like and use it :)

What do you think?

If you are into a particular genre, for example Metal and would like to have it say ""This is &lt;insert name&gt; and you are listening to Shredditor's Ball on radio reddit"" etc etc, that is great also.  

Feel free to be creative and come up with your own ideas! "	t5_2rb6n	True
1286553440.0	dolu5	"The officially licensed radio reddit ""Rock Me(me)"" t-shirt is available for pre-order."	HarryMuffin	26	7	12	"FINALLY! The officially licensed ""Rock Me(me) t-shirt is now available for pre-order.  This awesome shirt was designed by reddit's own [licenseplate](http://www.reddit.com/r/licenseplate and comes on a high quality American Apparel t-shirt in ""slate"".

The shirt is available in S/M/L/XL/XXL/XXXL and can be shipped anywhere on planet Earth. 

*The shirt can be ordered at http://www.radioreddit.com/rock_meme_tshirt  

The point of this t-shirt is not only to support radio reddit artists and bands, but to raise funds to keep up with our growth and server/operational needs (keep in mind this is a reddit community project, so if we have no donations or revenue we can't keep it alive). We are growing at a HUGE rate and really need the help.  

We hope you guys like the shirt, as it is hopefully the first of many officially licensed projects to come.  

Thanks and congrats to everyone for making radio reddit what it has become. "	t5_2rb6n	True

1346462212.0	z5z1o	Alright everyone, the month is over and the Best of Radio Reddit for August is coming. Important information for artists:	pextris	19	2	0	"Be sure that you edit your ""My Songs"" page and set your songs as ""releasable"".  This will allow us to include it in the Best Ofs.  We will attempt to e-mail contact anyone whose songs are *NOT* set releasable, but cannot include you if we do not hear from you by September 5th.

We are going to start with the top of [the charts](http://radioreddit.com/charts) and order the songs in just that manner for the release.  If we do not hear from the artists at the top of the chart, we will move on to the next one until we have 15 final songs, at which point we will release the compilation for download.  

Those who donated to the [Crowdtilt Campaign](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/radio-reddit-best-of-august-release) will get the release two days early in Lossless Audio format.  We will provide a download link and a code that will allow you to download the release 3 times (thank you GotFrog / Jesse for building this).  

Those who didn't contribute monetarily will get access to download the release in 128kbps format (the same we offer in the site).  

We also plan on doing this again next month if it seems like a good thing to do.

How do you feel about radio reddit having an auto-submission bot that submits the currently playing track on radio reddit, to /r/radioreddit, if it hasn't been submitted yet?  

I think that there is a large issue with people not wanting to associate less popular tracks with their accounts, and so less popular tracks are not submitted for voting. The implication of this is that less popular songs are not voted out of the rotation and so the quality is affected all around.  

Should we have a bot that submits tracks from our steams to this subreddit, there would be more content to vote on, and the quality would immediately be affected.  

Since octatone has build some awesome api's and featured on our part, it shouldn't be much of an issue at all. "	t5_2rb6n	True

TroutM4n	19	2	7	"I think doing this would drastically increase overall listenership and would also make people more likely to hear(and vote on) songs they would like. From an artist standpoint, it gets your songs to listeners who are already somewhat interested in hearing your music. I'm not saying we should kill the overall mix - far from it. I just think copying reddit's successful sub-reddit system to a degree would be very effective. I imagine that degree would stop before letting users create substations... but probably because of limitations of funding/hardware at this point.
The process could start by creating sub stations for each of the music genres you can submit under. Then, artists could select the applicable genres for their submission to have it played on that ""station"".
Submissions already go through a review process, it wouldn't take much more to verify they were listed under applicable genres. Also artists wouldn't want to submit under the wrong genre because it would make them more likely to receive downvotes.

So at this point we feel it has become necessary to revisit our upload policy in plain terms so that it is clear for everyone.

 All uploads must be the property of the contributor. If you didn't create it, all of the samples in it, or are not expressly licensed to use samples in it, we won't approve it for play or entry into our database.

 Because we are receiving hundreds of uploads a week now we do not have the resources/manpower to scrutinize and research every single track. We are all volunteers here and have lives outside of this project. So if there is a sample in your track that we have any doubts about, we reserve the right to deny it. We apologize if this an inconvenience.  As a remedy, we ask that if you upload tracks with samples that you are allowed to use (whether you have express permission or are covered under Creative Commons license or  Public Domain) we request that you include said permission in a PM to the mods so we can expedite the approval process for you. If for some reason one of your tracks got caught in the sweep unintentionally, please bring it to our attention so we can straighten it out for you.

 We are also noticing that at some point in the past a few tracks got past our upload standards. We ask that if you happen across any of these tracks please bring it to the attention of the mods so we can delete it from the database. Please include as much information about the track as possible, and a link to the song page.

We appreciate your patience and cooperation in this matter."	t5_2rb6n	True

We will be giving away stickers to the first 100 users to make a blog post, a twitter post, a facebook status, forum post, or any other online blurb that helps promote radioreddit. The posts need to link to http://www.radioreddit.com  with extra credit going to those that also link to http://www.reddit.com/r/radioreddit .  

The most creative and prolific posts will also receive two large stickers with the radio reddit logo.  One is out of print and can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g79hr/represent_the_rr/) and the other can be seen on [Stikkitnow](http://www.stikkitnow.com/product/radio-reddit-w-url).

**The first 100 users to send a message to the [radio reddit moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23radioreddit) with a link to the post, and their name and address will get the sticker.**

A final note: It is worth mentioning that it is up to us to get the word out about radioreddit, independent music, and the importance of promoting our own songs.  If we don't do it ourselves, then we are stuck with [things like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0).

This *does not* mean you will hear the same up voted song many times during an hour.  What it means is that we are defining probabilities so that a highly upvoted song will be next in the queue.


Currently we have it set that 1 out of every 4 songs is an above average song for the genre.  The average is calculated at playlist generation from all the songs that match the genre.  We do not set what constitutes a good song, it is determined by your up votes and the current running average score for the genre.


The other thing we are doing is setting a lower limit for what constitutes a ""bad"" song as defined by your down votes.  We have it set pretty low and currently only one song is being excluded at playlist generation.


In case none of what you just read makes any sense, here is a flowchart showing the playlist generation process: http://i.imgur.com/uIQdw.png

* [Exemption Requirements](http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements---Section-501%28c%29%283%29-Organizations)  

Benefits:  People can make tax-exempt donations, Radio Reddit would be tax exempt and could apply for grants, we could really make an impact for independent musicians' benefit.  

What could we offer to the community that we don't currently offer? Could we incorporate some sort of musical education program, etc?

We've had a lot of fun and made some [really](http://soundcloud.com/plingus/until-the-days-are-done) [great](http://soundcloud.com/needanameok/team-10-the-ex) [songs](http://soundcloud.com/memefilter/what-is-love), and I encourage anyone who likes a challenge to join up.  

This is not why I'm posting though.

This round's theme is ""holidays"", /r/songwars has chosen it as their theme too, and all of us (generally speaking) are planning on ""releasing"" a Reddit ""holiday album"".  THAT is what I want you to get involved with.

(If all goes as planned) [radioreddit](http://radioreddit.com/) will host a dedicated ""holiday music"" stream, and all the holiday songs generated by Reddit musicians [can and should be uploaded there](http://radioreddit.com/uploading).  The ""album"" will probably be a ""pay what you want"" package on bandcamp or similar - **they're free** but (in theory) you'll be able to donate if you want to, and you can DL single songs or the whole package.  There may be some voting process to hone down the material to an ""album's length"" (overall upvotes are a very Reddit-y way of sorting the best tunes), but that's only speculation at this point, and your ideas are welcome.  

You still own your tunes, you retain all rights.  No hidden agenda.

So, if anyone here is thinking about writing a ""holiday"" song, please submit it to /r/holidaysongs so we can include it.  Post any related questions there too.  There are no other topical restrictions (profanity/blasphemy/etc) so write about whatever you want (in the ""holiday"" spirit, of course).  Parody songs are fine too.

It would be a one-time fee per radio reddit account (not per upload).  To make it fair, all old accounts would be asked to pay the one-time fee for their first upload if and when we decide to go this route.

It would be similar to [metafilter's new user fee](http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi) ; a nominal amount, but more than enough to fund server costs going forward.

There would be no fee on listeners.  Since radio reddit gives all artists equal opportunity to be heard, I think the onus should be on the artists to keep it funded.

1300898405.0	g9t5b	Small improvement to the radio reddit playlist algorithm.	octatone	17	3	7	"In reponse to listener complaints of the sometimes hit or miss nature of the streams, we tweaked the playlist algorithm just a smidge.

The old playlist order was as follows:

* new song best
* old song normal
* old song best
* old song normal

Where best &gt; the playlist's average score (varies from playlist to playlist), new == newer than three months, and normal is any song with a score between -10 and up to the playlist's average.

**The new order is as follows:**

* new best
* old rising
* new normal
* old best
* new rising
* old normal

Best and new are the same as before.  Rising is song score &gt; 1/2 the playlist's average score.  Normal is now any song with a score from -5 to 1/2 the playlists average score.

This change makes it so that there are always at least two good songs before a potential less than stellar song is played.  It also promotes songs with scores that are rising towards greatness.

Any song below -5 is not included for play on the streams.  You can always resurect music by finding it in /discover and upvoting it."	t5_2rb6n	True

The t-shirt will be used to raise funds to keep the project afloat and growing.  Reddit has generously offered to make the t-shirt available in the Reddit store.  

What we need to decide and discuss is:  

* Dark or light t-shirt?
* Do we want any taglines for the shirt, or just ""radio reddit"" somewhere, or just the design?
* Do we want the design on ONE location on the shirt, or something on the back as well, or on the sleeve?
* What are five adjectives or phrases that describe radio reddit that should be translated into the shirt design!

Thanks again licenseplate for being so awesome.

&gt;We absolutely do not allow autoplay audio on our network, but sometimes a few creatives do slip through the cracks.  In order to find and ban the ad, we ask for the following:
&gt;
&gt;1)  If the creative is not flash, please right click on the ad and copy the link address.
&gt;
&gt;2)  If the creative is flash based, we recommend using the TamperData FireFox plugin.  Once this has been installed, you can open up TamperData (under 'tools') and place it another window.  Please then visit the page where you're visiting the problematic creative.  If it doesn't pull up, go ahead and hit 'clear data' within the tamper data window.  Please repeat until the process until the creative shows up.
&gt;
&gt;Then, on the tamper data window, please first filter by the ad size ('300x250' for example).  Copy all the click data into an email.  Next you will want to remove the current ad size filter, and input 'adnxs"".  Please copy all the click data into the same email and send.

So if you run into one of these ads, **please** help us out by using one of these methods or getting any info over to us at admin@radioreddit.com

First I'd like to thank Johncub for his spectacular work on the database back end.  Thanks to him We have the ability to connect users to tracks/genres/reddit username/album name/making track available for download, etc.  He has truly made life easier.  Also thanks to octatone who is taking all of this new found information and doing really awesome things with it.  Which leads to a few new features we'd like to fill you in on that are coming soon.

* The ability for users to upload their tracks and mark them as ""downloadable"".  
* Scheduled playlists.  We can now pre-program playlists to play certain genres of music at certain times.  Example. If at 8pm on a Wednesday we want a show that plays folk/banjo metal/polka country... we can do that. It pulls all the genre information from the database.
* A Calendar that shows playlists and shows.  You will see what playlists and shows are going to play ahead of time. Eventually this will tie into DJ shows as well so you know what is going to happen ahead of time.
* Podcast.  We will be tying the genre based/show based playlists into podcasts so that you can download the shows automatically as the show ends.  
* &lt;Insert ideas here.&gt; "	t5_2rb6n	True

As you may or may not know we are a project made up solely of volunteer reddit users.  After the reddit.com staff became aware of us, they have been 100% supportive, and awesome about helping us grow.  Recently they put up a graphic ad for us [that you can see here](http://www.redditmedia.com/ads/radio%20reddit%20ad%209) that points to our subreddit. Why is this important? Because those being driven to the subreddit are voting on tracks.  

This is important for many reasons. Most importantly, our streams are dynamically built on the hour based on voter trends.  More popular songs are starting to float to the top, and unpopular songs are starting to filter out.  This project was built as a sort of ""crowd source radio station"".  

Also, our traffic numbers have increased on our website because people are checking out related tracks, our [charts](http://radioreddit.com/charts], etc...  

In other words, the project and community is starting to run and build itself.  Musicians are being heard, listeners are building the streams based on votes, and collectively OUR voice is being heard.  

Here is the obligatory ""uh-oh"": As we are a community run project, we fund ourselves, and do not pay ourselves. We are licensed to use the reddit trademarks, etc.. but we fund ourselves for servers, licenses, etc. What this means is if we don't make enough in a month to cover , two of us do it out of pocket.  So if you'd like to help you can:

____________________________________________________________  
 
 ============================================================
:: 1. Editors note:
============================================================  
 
Here it is, the first radio reddit newsletter. This will be a monthly journal of what is
happening with radio reddit and we hope that this will be the first of many..the
beginning of an era..the force that pushed...well, you get it.  We have come a long 
way since our humble beginnings in December of '09 and are confident that we have 
put down a solid foundation for which to grow.  
 
We've gone from an idea, to a test stream that crashed 10 minutes before go time,
to a three server wide internet radio station that allows users to create the stream
by voting up what they like, and voting down what they don't like. While this whole
project has the blessing of reddit.com and its admins, we still remain a community
project that is run and funded by its own users.  
 
It is important to note everyone that has allowed this idea to get to where it is now,
as they have all put invaluable work into the project:  
 
octatone: programmer / wizard / admin  
 
johncub: donated great code and programming time to the website's functionality  
 
licenseplate: artist with the speed and accuracy of a robot  
 
eogprod: overseer of the upload track approval que  
 
#radioreddit irc channel people: (pie_mage,hyperstatic,gorf,psyingo,omnishadowtopia..trust me 
it is worth joining in the chat just to see this guy in action.. he is one of a kind, etc, etc.)  
 
RadixCloud and Exoware for donating VPS's to lighten the load.   
 
Everyone else that knows how much they are appreciated.   
 
                                     -harrymuffin (pextris@radioreddit.com)
============================================================
:: 2. Rock Meme fundraising T-shirt
============================================================  
 
The Rock Meme fundraising T-shirt is now available for purchase. The shirt was 
designed by licenseplate and is available at http://radioreddit.com/rock_meme_tshirt
The shirt can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. as well as internationally.  The shirt
is meant to help us pay for our ever-growing server needs so please buy one if you 
can. It is VERY important to understand that the T-shirts are currently on a pre-order
basis. Once   
 
 ============================================================
:: 3. Separate electronic music stream
============================================================  
 
Due to the huge amount of electronic/techno/DnB uploads, we have put up a 
secondary stream for just electronic music.  This will also be a test run to see how
multiple streams for different genres are received by listeners.  To check out the 
""Beats and Turnips"" electronic music stream you can tune in at:
http://www.radioreddit.com/listen/electronic .  
 
 ============================================================
:: 4. Current server costs
============================================================  
 
As it stands our current server bill is 90 dollars per month. This gives us a server in 
a very reliable facility with root access, two quad core CPU's, 2 gigs of RAM,
160GB HD with total redundancy and backups, 100MBIT link to the internet, 
and 2TB of bandwidth per month.  This is very much necessary to handle all of our 
stream transcoding/stream output/web server, etc.    
 
As mentioned before, we are a 100% user driven community who is funded solely 
by the community. If you are interested in helping the cause so that we can 
sustain and grow, please consider a paypal donation of a few dollars at 
http://www.radioreddit.com/donate or by buying a Rock Meme fundraiser shirt at
http://www.radioreddit.com/rock_meme_tshirt    
 
 ============================================================
:: 5. Advertising
 ============================================================  

We  are now offering low cost advertising space on radioreddit.com . If you 
are a reddit artist or band that is interested in promoting your band/project/show
please e-mail admin@radioreddit.com . We can put you in the ad loop for a very
minimal donation.  After all, we are in this together.

There are tons of places for artists to host their music and get a few fans, but very few places provide both a fan base and a means of compensation.

I particularly like the idea of having 'goals' eg. ""$500 for my next album, anything more goes for touring"" and people contributing towards that goal.

Also, I personally find the design/layout of the website too distracting and not at all encouraging me to stick around.
