1363535439.0	1agud4	Announcement: Reddit Bracket Challenge	rCBB_Mod	307	31	333	"Hello College Hoops fans.

Welcome to our Second Annual /r/CollegeBasketball Bracket Challenge. For the second year in a row subreddits will be competing for fame, glory, fabulous prizes and a year's worth of bragging rights. Unlike last year, each subreddit that competes will have their own bracket groups. This will allow for easier point tracking so you can follow who's leading and adjust your trash talk accordingly.

###Rules

* A group must have a minimum of 10 participants to win the 'best sub' prize. Each group must use the scoring system outlined below.

* Each bracket must be named after a reddit account that is at least 1 month old to qualify.

* Each user/reddit-username may only be entered in one group.

###How To Join

* Check below to see if your favorite subreddit has already created a group. If they have, follow the link to create your bracket. **Remember, it must have the same name as your reddit account**. Commissioners (yahoo's word for group admins) will be responsible for removing brackets that do not match an eligible reddit username.

* If they haven't, have the moderators of your sub follow [This Link](http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/t1) and click ""[Create Group](http://imgur.com/a/Vt8j0#0)"" or create the group yourself.

* [Fill out your group's settings](http://imgur.com/a/Vt8j0#1). **Choose the ""Fibonacci"" Scoring system** and make sure to leave the password field blank.

* Once the group is created, click [Invite Friends](http://imgur.com/a/Vt8j0#2), copy the [Invite Link](http://imgur.com/a/Vt8j0#3) and then [message our mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCollegeBasketball) so we can add it to this post. Make sure to tell your subreddit to ensure you have enough participants!

###Prizes!

The Winner of the Subreddit Challenge will be the group with the highest average among their top 10 brackets. The top ten for the winning group will win a month of Reddit Gold a piece, and your sub mentioned in the /r/CollegeBasketball header so everyone knows you're the best.

The Top Bracket among all participants regardless of subreddit affiliation will win shiny new Reddit gold, a $50 Amazon Gift Card, and a big gold trophy as flair on our sub whenever you comment in /r/CollegeBasketball. Try not to gloat too much!

Want more? Well here are even more chances to win fame and fortune:

**Top Bracket:** $50 Amazon gift card

**Second Bracket:** $25 Amazon gift card

**Third Bracket:** $10 Amazon gift card

**Biggest Upset picked***: Reddit Gold

**Perfect Final Four***: Reddit Gold

**Perfect 'Tie-Breaker' score for Championship Game***: Reddit Gold

**Tie-Breakers will be broken using bracket scores. Also be sure to give shout outs to the reddit admin team for gifting all the reddit gold prizes.*

---

Still not enough reason to play? In addition to all the overall prizes, the best user in each *individual* bracket group of ten or more will also win reddit gold. So get your favorite sub to join!

We'll be posting an updated leader-board after the round of 32; Sweet Sixteen; Elite Eight; and Championship game.

Hello college hoops fans.

I'm pleased to announce our first annual intra-reddit Bracket challenge. Our sub will be competing against other subs for bragging rights as reddit's Bracket Challenge winner.

The point of the challenge is to have a bit of friendly competition between the subs while providing a chance to cross-promote.

If you'd like to compete, here are the rules:

* A sub must have a minimum of 10 participants to win.
* All participants will submit a bracket to our [ESPN group](http://games.espn.go.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/en/group?groupID=17464).
* Participants will then [visit this page to enter your bracket for your subreddit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHZUb0pCem10LW93R2pubEdOUHE3cWc6MQ#gid=0).

    The top 10 brackets from each sub will be averaged to declare a winner.
* We'll also award a gold trophy to the top overall bracket, silver trophies to 2-5 and bronze for brackets 6-10.
* All subs that compete will put a 'congrats to [winning sub]' banner on their subreddit for a month after the finals that links to the final standings.

So go ahead and join the ESPN group then lets us know which sub you're representing. Then, fill out your brackets after Selection Sunday and let the madness begin!

1332770636.0	re6yj	Hey Internet, can we stop making fun of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist - a college freshman who may have a speaking disorder - for struggling to speak with the media?	dallashoosier	254	41	106	"I've seen more than a few blog posts like [this one](http://thehoopdoctors.com/online2/2012/03/video-michael-kidd-gilchrist-has-a-way-with-words/) that take MKG to task for struggling to speak with reporters. After doing some digging, I saw it suggested on a few Kentucky boards that he may have a stuttering issue or another similar type of speaking disorder. I'm a blogger myself, so I poke fun at athletes and coaches all the time, but it seems to me that a freshman in college, who does absolutely nothing that warrants reproach on or off the court, should not have to worry about idiot bloggers like me or others making fun of him because he struggles to speak and yet has to do it with microphones shoved into his face so we can all have our precious sports sound bytes.

Sorry if this comes off as over-the-top criticism, but it really does piss me off. And I hate Kentucky. But I feel like we forget how immature most of us were as college freshmen. Plus, why make fun of someone who really looks like he is struggling with something, especially when it may be a pervasive problem in his life. Why is there humor in that? 

Anyway, flame away if you feel I'm overreacting. I just wanted to put this out there. I've seen MKG made fun of on Twitter and other places, and it just strikes me as totally ridiculous and insensitive.

Edit: I decided to [post about this on MSF](http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2012/03/michael-kidd-gilchrist-deserves-praise-not-mockery-as-he-battles-stutter-in-public-view/), and in the process I found [this article by Pat Forde](http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/news?slug=pf-forde_kidd_gilchrist_kentucky_louisville_123111), which includes the following:

&gt;If this was going to be a hard-knocking game, that was fine with MKG. He is a magna cum laude graduate of the school of hard knocks.

&gt;He has worked hard to overcome a childhood stutter. He grew up without a father, who was killed when Michael was 2 years old. His uncle, Darrin Kidd, died on the day Michael was going to sign his letter-of-intent to Kentucky; months later, he added “Kidd” to his name.

&gt;“I struggled,” Kidd-Gilchrist said.

Yeah, but let's mock this kid.

I work with a scouting service called [PremierBall](http://www.premierball.com/), founded a couple years ago by former UNLV basketball player [Christian Popoola](http://www.twitter.com/premierball). About 50 Division I schools have signed up for our service, including Duke, Kentucky, Kansas, UCLA, and UNLV. We're national, with an emphasis on the west coast and in a few other hot spots around the country.

I've also been helping an NBA team evaluate players for the NBA Draft. I won't name the team or go into specifics about exactly what that work entails.

I'm a Philly native, have lived in beautiful Portland, Oregon, and am currently based out of Las Vegas.

For some basic info on my background and story, you can read [this](http://www.jameskerti.com/james-kerti/). To get the obvious question out of the way, I have little meaningful playing or coaching experience. I played intramural ball through college.

For more on my background and to connect with me, check me out on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jameskerti/).

I'll be watching (on ESPN) and tweeting about the HoopHall Classic today, which features top high school teams like Simeon, Montverde, Findlay Prep, and Archbishop Mitty. Those teams include elite high school prospects like Jabari Parker, Kasey Hill, and Aaron Gordon. For more on that, follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jameskerti).

Let's do it. AMAA!

EDIT: Four hours in, but I'm still going. Don't stop now!

EDIT2: Closing in on the six hour mark . . . let's keep going!

EDIT3: Almost 4 PM on the west coast. Going strong! Keep the questions coming. I've tried to address every one so far.

EDIT4: Just about 6 PM Pacific. Not sure I've missed a question yet. I'd really appreciate it if you could [follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jameskerti) too! Great basketball dialogue on there, and I'm always happy to answer questions there as well. It helps me out a lot. :)

EDIT5: It's occurred to me that people who normally live on reddit at work and were off today may not have had a chance to chime in. I'll answer questions throughout the day tomorrow too!

1372286033.0	1h50u3	Cool story about Coach K	WhatThePenis	238	56	95	"So I was at Coach K's Duke Basketball Camp this past week, when unfortunately I broke my growth plate in a camp game and had to be hauled in an ambulance to the Duke Hospital. One of the managers, who is close with my dad, called to check in to see if I was okay, what the diagnosis was, etc. and then he said ""I have someone that wants to talk to you"" and I said alright. 

""Hey [my name], it's Coach K""

I was star struck. I had no idea what to say so I stuttered a ""H-hey!""

He told me how he heard that I acted real tough when I got hurt (I was on the ground for 45 minutes having trainers look at me. I figured there's no reason to cry about what I can't control, so I sat and made funny faces at my teammates and cracked jokes with the staff) and that I would have fit in well with him in the Army. He then told me he'd be glad to meet me the next day at Cameron when the camp was over. After I watched my team play their last game (we went undefeated!) I hopped on a golf cart over to Cameron, went into the Duke locker room, and Coach K was standing there in the hallway. We shook hands, talked for a little bit, and he talked about how he was glad I didn't have to have surgery on my knee. Then Jon Scheyer and Ryan Kelly walked in, saying they wanted to meet the ""toughest kid at camp"". That made my day, and I told Ryan that when I came back from the injury, I would drop 36 in my first game to honor him. They all laughed and then Coach K said he would love for me to come sit courtside behind the Duke bench at one of the games next season and I happily agreed. We all took a picture together, and I headed back home with a cast up to my thigh. 

So I guess it was a good trade-off for a broken leg!

Just thought I would share this story for anyone who wanted to read. 

TL;DR: Broke leg at duke basketball camp, Coach K called me and met me the next day along with Ryan Kelly and Jon Scheyer and offered me courtside seats to a home game next season.

It's also worth noting that Davis was doing this when he was 18, while Withey is a senior. However, I do believe that Withey is in the middle of spectacular season, and I don't think he's getting nearly enough buzz for POY.

But you probably know me better as the guy who started the Club Trillion blog in 2008, or as the guy who writes college basketball articles for Grantland that you take way too seriously. Whatever the case, feel free to ask me anything about college basketball or anything else your heart desires, so long as it doesn't involve Greg Oden's penis, because I've been prompted to talk about his dong far too often in the past couple of years.

**Edit** Tried to answer as many as I could. I'm going to grab some lunch and do a couple of interviews, but I'll be back here later to answer some more, so keep asking away.

**Edit 2** Back for more. I'll answer as many as I can until my fiancee gets on me about being on the computer all day. Then I'll go spend some time with her, make everything better, and come back and answer some more. Let's do it.

*Champions of the B1G tournament, Ohio State looks poised to make a run in the West Region of the bracket after a decisive victory over Iona. The #1, #3, #4, and #5 seeds are gone, can Ohio State capitalize off the other low seeds' misfortune or will they similarly fall? In any case, Iowa State stands in their way--an always dangerous team out of the big twelve who annihilated 7th-seeded Notre Dame earlier in the weekend. Here's to a good game!*

*Tradition*
****
* [“My Old Kentucky Home”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsQj46swDvI) is sung at nearly every athletic event, most notably after every basketball game, and before every football game. The tune was written by the great Stephen Foster and has become the commonwealth of Kentucky’s official song. When the crowds joins in singing, it creates an eerie droning hum that sends chills up your spine. When singing the lyrics “We will sing one song...” it is tradition to hold up one finger.  
* [“The Y”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwvDzwFYmw) is a Rupp Arena tradition that honors former players or notable people in the state’s history. During a long media timeout in the second half of basketball games, the UK cheerleaders will spell out “K-E-N-T-U-C-K” with the help of the crowd, lying on the floor and using their bodies to draw the individual letters. When a special guest is in the house, he or she will walk out on the court and hold up their hands to be the honorary “Y” in “Kentucky.” [LeBron James](http://elitistjerksports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lebrony.jpg), [Randall Cobb](http://media.kentucky.com/smedia/2012/01/31/21/40/MWzzb.AuSt.79.jpg), and former players like [John Wall](http://vaughtsviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wall-.jpg) and [Michael Kidd-Gilchrist](http://ksr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mkg-y-emu.jpg) have come out to center court to a rousing round of applause.

**Local Dining:**  
*[Tolly-Ho](http://i.imgur.com/CxDpp8g.jpg): This is THE greasy spoon of Lexington. Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, “The Ho” is one of the finest late-night destinations after a night of partying or bar-hopping. Whether you get a “Ho burger” with cheddar tots, or a “Super Ho” with fries, you can always get your munchies on at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning, and always have company. Tolly-Ho was once located on South Limestone St. near the heart of campus, but the dining establishment recently relocated a few blocks away for a bigger space. Still the same delicious food, just a new spot.  

*[Ramsey’s](http://i.imgur.com/2BRd0yL.jpg): A similar greasy spoon feel, but less of a college-kid atmosphere. Ramsey’s is all about southern home cookin’ with a local flair. They feature a Kentucky special, the “Hot Brown,” which is considered one of the best in Lexington. Not to mention, Ramsey’s owns and serves Missy’s Pies, and after polishing off a homestyle meal, nothing goes down sweeter.  

*[Goodfellas](http://i.imgur.com/i6mdWUn.jpg): Ooey gooey New York style pizza, served on not one - but TWO - paper plates. It’s that good, and that “high class.” Another late-night destination when at Two Keys Tavern - a frequented bar by UK students - or anytime for an extra-large (22 inch) pie with your buddies; coming in a box that barely fits through your front door... seriously. Arguably the best pizza in Lexington, with a close second to our next local dining establishment...  

*[Joe Bologna’s](http://i.imgur.com/YdcN8UJ.jpg): A Lexington favorite, most famous for being located inside an old Jewish synagogue. The stained glass and chandeliers remained, and a section of the altar now forms the bar area. Joe Bologna’s serves the usual Italian fare, along with some mean pizza pie and sandwiches.

*Random Trivia*
***
Kentucky is the all-time winningest program in NCAA history in terms of both total wins (2,111) and winning percentage (.762). The Wildcats are also No. 1 in total NCAA Tournament appearances (52), NCAA Tournament wins (111), and NCAA Tournament games played (157). UK is the only school in the country to win a national championship under five different head coaches (Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, and Calipari), and the ‘Cats also hold NCAA records for Elite Eight appearances (34), Sweet 16 appearances (39), and total postseason tournament (NCAA and NIT) appearances (61).  
    
By winning the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) twice (1946 and 1976), Kentucky is the only program to win multiple NCAA and NIT titles.  
  
The Wildcats have gone 861 consecutive games (non-exhibition) with at least one three-point field goal made, the third longest three-point streak in the nation. Only UNLV and Vanderbilt have a longer active streak in men's college basketball.  

Actress Ashley Judd, a graduate of the University of Kentucky (and Paul G. Blazer High School in Ashland, KY), is one of the biggest and most vocal ‘Cats fans in showbiz. She can often be seen [cheering courtside in Rupp Arena](http://www.sports-venue.info/sitebuilder/images/Rupp_Arena_7-542x408.jpg) or at tournament games.  
  
The nickname “Wildcats” became associated with the university in 1909 after the football team defeated the University of Illinois on the road in early October. Then-chief of military Commandant Phillip W. Corbusier stated the team had “fought like wildcats.” The nickname stuck and was later adopted as the official mascot, replacing the former “Cadets.”  

Unfortunately, the University of Kentucky is one of only two basketball programs to ever receive the NCAA “death penalty.” Though power to enforce the rule was not granted to the NCAA until 1985, the SEC banned Kentucky from competition in 1952-1953 (and discouraged the rest of the country from scheduling them) after a 1951 point shaving scandal involving three former players, forcing Kentucky to cancel the entire season. Interestingly enough, Rupp’s ‘Cats went 25-0 (14-0 SEC) the following season in 1953-1954, but declined an invitation to the NCAA Tournament after three players (Frank Ramsey, Cliff Hagan, and Lou Tsioropoulos) were ruled ineligible to compete due to the now defunct rule barring any players who had already graduated.  
   
***  
*What is and What is to Come*  
***  
The 2012-13 season was definitely a disappointment to almost every UK fan. Kentucky started the season ranked highly and came in with a great recruiting class, but ultimately, there never seemed to be any cohesion in that group starting at the point guard position. Right around the time things seemed to begin to mesh, star player Nerlens Noel went down with an ACL tear, effectively ending any hopes the Wildcats had of salvaging an NCAA Tournament appearance. It has become a running joke in /r/CollegeBasketball, as everyone knows (and has not let us fans forget), Kentucky ended up losing to Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT in a game that really looked as though the Cats had thrown in the towel for the season. Following the season, Archie Goodwin and Nerlens Noel left for the NBA and both were selected in the first round. Julius Mays and Twany Beckham graduated, and Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State. Kyle Wiltjer (at the time of writing) is still debating a possible transfer.
  
The 2013-14 season outlook seems to be much brighter than the previous. Kentucky is bringing in the highest rated recruiting class EVER. Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein return to Kentucky for their sophomore campaigns and from all accounts, both seem to have made strides (likely because they know they will be competing against some of the best players in the country for playing time this year). The additions of Julius Randle, Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Dakari Johnson, James Young, and Marcus Lee (as well as in-state standouts Derek Willis, Dominique Hawkins, and EJ Floreal) look to revitalize the team, and have most people ranking them No. 1 overall to start the season.  
  
This team does not initially appear to struggle with the same chemistry issues that plagued the previous team, but only time will tell.  By all accounts so far, though, this team appears to be poised to bring the Big Blue Nation title No. 9.

Thanks to a work mixup, I'll start actively taking questions a few minutes after 2 ET, rather than right on the dot. (My employer scheduled me for a chat this afternoon, so I'm pulling a sort of double-duty.) My apologies for any delay. On the bright side, maybe [KUMitch will get to participate after his Arabic exam](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/12n07e/announcement_slight_changes_to_this_weeks_ama/c6wh9d0)? And I'll stick around longer this afternoon to make up for it. Send along whatever you've got and we'll get the discussion going ASAP. Looking forward to it. Thanks! 

**Edit**: As of 2:05 p.m. ET, I'm here and answering questions. I was going to do an identity-proof thing on Twitter but I realized it would look really weird in the coffee shop, so you'll just have to take my word for it. Let's do this. 

**Edit No. 2**: As of 4:48 p.m. ET, it's time to let the poor dog outside. I will keep an eye on the page tonight and follow up wherever possible. 

Thanks to everyone for your hospitality. This was, as expected, a ton of fun. Cheers!"	t5_2rj3j	True

****
**Record:** [31-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Kansas_Jayhawks_men%27s_basketball_team)

**Coach:** Bill Self

**Key Players:** Ben McLemore, Travis Releford, Jeff Withey, Elijah Johnson, Naadir Tharpe

**Key Moments:**

* #10 Kansas State @ #14 Kansas: Sitting on three straight losses Kansas faced a Kansas State team who was both ahead of them in the conference standings and national rankings. Kansas pulled away in the first half and never looked back. Ben McLemore had 30 points on 9-13 shooting including 6 threes.

* Both at home and away to Iowa State: Both were come from behind overtime victories critical to maintaining Kansas's conference championship streak. Ben McLemore had 33 points on 10-12 shooting in the first game along with [this last second bank shot to send the game to OT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qaHPwRrxw). In the second game Elijah Johnson hit 6 threes to and scored 39 to help Kansas secure their second OT victory over Iowa State in a row. Kansas outscored Iowa State 36-16 in both OT periods combined.

*Greatest Games*
****

There's a ton to consider, so I'm actually going to leave off both the 2008 and 1988 National Championship games since those are easy pickings. Obviously there are more that I don't include here and that I probably forgot about.

* [#3 Missouri @ #4 Kansas (2012):](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqK1sfEGqFA) In the final game of the Border War series Kansas avenged their earlier loss at Missouri by overcoming a 19 point second half deficit. This win also secured Kansas at least a share of the conference title. 

* [#15 Texas @ #3 Kansas (2007)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfA6Q-LFeAo): In Kevin Durant's only game in Allen Fieldhouse Durant scored 25 first half points to put Texas up by double digits before Kansas came storming back. 

* [#12 Indiana @ #6 Kansas (1993)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSZbiM8tfLE) In this back and forth thriller Indiana's Damon Bailey scored 36 including 15 from the free throw line but Kansas freshman Jacque Vaughn stole the show as he hit a game winning three pointer with 0.2 left in overtime to win the game.

* [Kansas vs #20 Kansas State (1988 Elite Eight)](http://www.rockchalk.com/games/g198836.sht): Kansas State had already won two of three that year but the game to go to the Final Four would be won by the Jayhawks. This game is seen as a turning point for both fan bases as Kansas State would eventually suffer through the 90's and Kansas would see success with new coach Roy Williams.

* [Kentucky @ #2 Kansas (1989)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49FRv8ELdCo) Because why not. Kansas scores 80 first half points in route to a 150-95 victory over Pitino's Wildcats.

* [Sunflower Showdown (Kansas State)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_-_Kansas_State_basketball_all-time_results) (KU leads 186-91)- While the series on the court was more evenly matched in the 1970's through early 80's, Kansas took off after 1990 going 55-5 against the Wildcats. 

****

*Traditions*

****

* Camping for seats

While ""camping"" started with students actually setting up tents outside the fieldhouse, the athletic department eventually let students wait for games inside the fieldhouse halls. Nowadays the waiting process begins early in the morning after the previous basketball game. Students show up at 6 AM during the week (or 8 AM on weekends) with their group to draw a number which will give them their spot in line. One representative has to be there the entire camping period or risk getting their group cut off. This is done for every single home game including non-conference and winter break games. 

* Waving the wheat

Kansas fans ""wave the wheat"" with their arms after an opposing player fouls out and after the final buzzer in a victory.

* [The Rock Chalk chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=h51be27dN8c#t=63s):

Created in 1886 by a chemistry professor for the KU science club, the original version was ""Rah, Rah, Jayhawk, KU"" but was changed soon after to ""Rock Chalk"" in reference to the limestone found in Lawrence and used to build many of the buildings on campus. The chant has been known to rally troops in the Philippines, in World War II and was called the ""greatest college chant"" he'd ever heard by Teddy Roosevelt. Is used in modern times before games and after victories are sealed. 

* [The Intro Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UF2fToLaOak#t=60s)

It might as well be a tradition since it's awesome and you should watch it.

*History of Lawrence:*

****

Lawrence was founded in 1854 by a group of settlers from Massachusetts – hence the name of the street that downtown is centered around.  They were supporters of Kansas becoming a free state, which incited a great deal of regional conflict in Lawrence's early days.  Lawrence was raided in 1856 by pro-slavery activists led by the county sheriff, destroying the offices printing anti-slavery newspapers and what was then known as the Free State Hotel (now the Eldridge Hotel).  In retaliation, abolitionist John Brown led a number of raids into Missouri, killing pro-slavery settlers and slave owners.  He is something of a local hero in Lawrence: Lawrence's Free State Brewery has a [large mural of him standing inside](http://www.kshs.org/places/capitol/tour/graphics/curry_tragic_prelude.jpg), which KU fans [altered](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2009/03/02/ku_bkc_mu_04900h400w_t650.jpg?eec9ecda5f66de59a37bbdb23c6f48523261b548) for a basketball game against Missouri.  Militant anti-slavery activists were nicknamed “Jayhawkers”, which is where KU took its mascot, the Jayhawk.  Lawrence was again raided in 1863 by William Quantrill in retaliation for an earlier Kansas raid on the city of Osceola.  The raiders killed most of the male population of Lawrence and destroyed a number of buildings; nevertheless, Lawrence persevered, adopting the city motto “From Ashes to Immortality”.  The University of Kansas was founded in 1864.  Lawrence residents take a great deal of pride in Lawrence's early history; the local microbrewery Free State Brewery takes its name from this, as does one of the two high schools, Lawrence Free State High School.

**Iconic campus buildings:**

[Daisy Hill](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2012/10/10/daisy_hill_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067) – Daisy Hill is the colloquial name for a hill about half a mile from the center of campus housing the majority of the dorms.

[Strong Hall](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7164/6433959919_21d0e61883_z.jpg) – Named for former chancellor Frank Strong, this building now serves as the location for administrative offices.  It was added to the national register of historic places in 1998.

[Dyche Hall](http://www.kansastravel.org/lawrence/blog110402e.JPG) – Opened in 1903, Dyche Hall was named for former professor Lindsay Dyche.  It was added to the national register of historic places in 1973, and houses the [KU Natural History Museum](http://imgur.com/a/bH00N).

[Wescoe Hall](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2014/2454058090_1629f09f87_o.jpg) – Widely considered the biggest eyesore on campus, Wescoe was originally intended to be a parking garage, but lack of funding turned it into the building we see today.  It houses a number of humanities programs.

[Fraser Hall](http://www.cookseyphotography.com/travel/kansas/random_ks07/images/KU%20Fraser%20Hall.jpg), [2](http://www.ku.edu/images/second-level/about/students-on-fraser-lawn.jpg) – Fraser Hall is the highest point on Mount Oread, and until the building of the Oread Hotel, was the highest point in the city of Lawrence.  It serves as a campus landmark, and houses a number of departments in the social sciences.  

[Watson Library](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7030/6433950313_6ba97e7dea_z.jpg) – Watkins Library has been the main campus library since it was opened in 1924.

[Anschutz Library](http://www.lib.ku.edu/pressroom/snapshot/images/sunningatanschutzbanner.jpg ) – While some books are held here, Anschutz is better known as the spot for students pulling all-nighters, as it is open 24 hours a day.  Students refer to it as “Club Anschutz”.

[Allen Fieldhouse](http://hauserphotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Allen-Field-House.jpg), [2](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8421/7731374420_099204464a_z.jpg) – Opened in 1955, named for legendary Kansas coach Forrest “Phog” Allen.  In a study done by ESPN, it was ranked as the loudest college basketball arena in the nation.

[Potter Lake](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2243/2494303946_2a3b293908_z.jpg?zz=1) – Built in 1910, students used to dump goalposts in Potter Lake after a rare KU football victory.

[The Campanile](http://www.oread.ku.edu/Oread05/May13/May13images/campanile.jpg) – Overlooks the football stadium and the Kansas Union.  During the graduation ceremony, students proceed through the Campanile; tradition holds that students who pass through one end and exit out the other before graduation will never graduate from KU.

**Restaurants:**

[Free State Brewery](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_r2rG8D8U4D8/TOMFh4YX7TI/AAAAAAAAATE/0tbfk9USAsk/s1600/Free+State+Brewery.jpg), [2](http://www.kansassampler.org/KSamp-admin/8wonderscuisphotos/l/57.jpg) – Fantastic craft brewery based in Lawrence with some great food too.   

[Jefferson's](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2011/02/08/cropped_Jeffersons__t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067) – Not a Lawrence original but it might as well be; well known for the dollar bills signed by patrons that cover its walls.

[Burger Stand](http://midwesternbelle.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/thecabashburgerstandlawrence.jpg) – Gourmet burger joint; was recently named one of the top 25 burgers in the country by Zagat. 

[Papa Keno's](http://kansan.com/media/2011/04/1A_PapaKenos_Tyoung.jpg) – Lawrence institution: famous for serving pizza slices bigger than your face. 

[Johnny's](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/places/johns__t670.jpg?b3f6a5d7692ccc373d56e40cf708e3fa67d9af9d) – Classic college sports bar, full of KU memorabilia. 

**Bars:**

[Louise's](http://johnkellerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/MG_60611-300x200.jpg ) – best known for their fantastic Thursday special of 2.50 domestic schooners.

[Bull](http://cdn4.vtourist.com/4/4424213-Keep_them_fenced_in_Lawrence.jpg)/[Hawk](http://www.pitch.com/imager/the-hawk/b/original/2206868/aa44/5766707.0.jpg)/[Wheel](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/marketplace/businesses/images/2011/08/24/wheel_1_t670.jpg?b3f6a5d7692ccc373d56e40cf708e3fa67d9af9d), [2](http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/p480x480/564056_326928290694875_266510592_n.jpg), [3](http://cdn.tweetwood.com/images/celeb/408/92/ocghc/JayBilas-jag5-570x.jpg) – Predominantly Greek bars; the Hawk in particular is the classic underage bar.  Most non-Greek people avoid it like herpes once turning 21.  The Wheel is one of the most famous Lawrence bars.  The ESPN basketball college gameday crew make it a point of visiting the Wheel whenever they cover a KU game to get the famous “Wangburger” (a cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon).


[Sandbar](http://media.thesandbar.com/images/sandbar-building.png) – Best known for their tropical-themed drinks (including the [Shark Attack](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TL47Osen0zE/ULO_PqjM4iI/AAAAAAAAAUE/7E7_T4s9HP8/s640/blogger-image-417615326.jpg), a blue drink supplied with a toy shark filled with red grenadine that you mix into the drink making it look like – wait for it – a shark attack).

[Red Lyon](http://www.pitch.com/imager/the-red-lyon-tavern/b/original/2205721/8d2d/5663876.0.jpg) – A somewhat classier bar with some good beer options (and free popcorn, complete with optional hot sauce).

Match Facts

-------

* This is the second time these two programs have met this season. The first being a November 15th match-up in the Champions Classic in Madison Square Garden. **Kentucky won 75-65.**

* The battle of the two winningest programs in college basketball history. Kentucky is the winningest program in NCAA history at **2089–649 (.763)** along with 7 National Titles; Kansas is the second winningest program of all-time at **2070-805 (.720)** and has 3 National Titles.

* Kentucky's **Anthony Davis** and Kansas' **Thomas Robinson** were the consensus Top-2 players in the country this year. Davis won the AP, Rupp, Oscar Robertson, Wooden and Naismith NPOY awards.

* **Kentucky** utilized the #1 recruiting class to supplement a core of players who reached the Final Four last season but fell short to eventual champions, UConn and Kemba Walker. Kentucky went undefeated in conference play at 16-0, but fell short in the SEC Championship Game to Vanderbilt.

* **Kansas** was widely considered pre-season to only finish Top-3 in the Big-12, but proved the naysayers wrong led by the season's most improved player in **Thomas Robinson**, Kansas won their impressive Eighth-straight Big-12 Conference Title, but fell short to eventual Elite Eight team, the Baylor Bears, in the Big-12 Tournament Semifinals.

* **Kansas** is ranked #16 in Offensive Efficiency and #4 in Defensive Efficiency by Ken Pomeroy stats. 

* **Kentucky** is ranked #2 in Offensive Efficiency and #11 in Defensive Efficiency by Ken Pomeroy stats.

* Both **Kentucky** and **Kansas** have held opponents to 39.8% in 2PT-FG% defense according to KenPom.com stats; good enough to both tie for 2nd in the country.

* This game is only the [27th time these two storied programs have met](http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/Kansas.html), and only the 4th time in the NCAAT. Kentucky leads the series 20-6.

I have been watching college basketball and the NCAA Tournaments for 15+ years now. It has always been a dream of mine to attend a game. One of those dreams that gets put off but you're not quite sure why.

I brought this up with my girlfriend a few months ago and she suggested we put some money aside and drive down to Raleigh next year for the opening rounds. Cool. So, we're gonna do that.

Then we decided that if we could find some cheap tickets on stubhub maybe we'll go to a Sweet 16 game in DC this year. Maybe but I doubt we could afford that.

Then it happened. Yesterday I check stubhub and notice that opening round tickets are super cheap when it gets close to tip off. I tell my girlfriend and she says, ""Well aren't you off tomorrow?""

""Yeah.""

""So am I. Are there any games nearby?""

""Uhhhh Philadelphia.""

""Cool. We should go.""

And it happened. I waited til 3 today and checked stubhub. $30/ticket. Ordered. Done. Let's go. Before I left I made this post here.

&gt; In about an hour I am going to fulfill a dream and actually attend an NCAA tournament game. I'm so excited. Hopefully the GTown/FCGU &amp; Oklahoma/SDSU games are good. Can't wait.

I was hoping the OU/SDSU game would be competitive and Georgetown wouldn't blow FGCU off the floor. Well we all know what happened there.

To put it bluntly, it was magical. It was everything I wanted it to be times a quadrillion. The game just marched on and I turned to my girlfriend and said, ""(FGCU is) up 15. We're either going to see a monumental upset or an insane comeback! This is bananas!""

When they made that alley-oop I thought the roof of the building was going to blow off. Holy crap was that amazing.

To FGCU and their fans. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart thank you for making this one of the greatest days of my life. It was like in Rudy when his dad sees the Notre Dame field and tears up. It meant the world to me just to be there. And to witness that? Amazing.

To Georgetown and their fans. As much as you're hurting I hope you take some solace in that this game, while unfortunate for the team you love, was something I will never forget. An experience I feel fortunate to have been able to witness and lucky to have someone in my life who cares enough about me to make my dream become a reality.

So thank you, thank you all. Let the madness continue."	t5_2rj3j	True

*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:** Two come to mind, others will probably think there should be more

* The entire 1976 season... as it was only one of seven ever perfect seasons culminating in a championship in NCAA basketball history, and the most recent.
* 1987 NCAA Championship game vs Syracuse. This was the first tournament with the 3 point shot, and IU was down in the last seconds when Keith Smart hit a beautiful shot and the Hoosiers won. Smart was named Most Outstanding Player, while IU scoring was lead by Steve Alford. Heres a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNSPHx9S-wM) of “The Shot”
* #1 Kentucky at Indiana, 12/10/11, IU’s Christian Watford hits a buzzerbeater to take down the #1 team, basically fueling the resurgence of IU in both the Top 25 lists and as a team in general. Tom Crean’s face is great in response to [the “ Watshot”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KbNmJQllmg).

**Greatest Players:**

* [George McGinnis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGinnis)

**Greatest Coaches:**

* [Branch McCracken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_McCracken)- Two national championships, four Big Ten championships, inducted into Naismith hall of Fame (1960)
* [Tom](http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tom-crean-mad.jpg) [Crean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Crean)- Resurgence of program to top tier after a few not so happy years. Two NCAA tournament berths, but we are hopeful for more.

*Random Trivia*
***

* [IU athletic’s list of all of their facilities](http://www.iuhoosiers.com/facilities/ind-facilities.html)
* After winning the 1987 National Champion, one of the fish from Showalter Fountain was stolen. From then on during any major sporting event the fountain has been guarded. A fish was recently stolen (the replacement for the championship one stolen), and returned [smelling like beer](http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/bronze-fish-missing-from-iconic-iu-fountain-found).

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
* What is: IU lost 4 key players. Zeller and Oladipo are obvious at 2 and 4 pick in the draft, but Jordan Hulls' leadership and winning mentality had been unmatched in the past decade of IU basketball. Christian Watford is a key departure as well. We are left with Will Sheehey as our senior leader and Yogi Ferrell as probably our best player, which is good enough to make us fringe top-25 ranked to start the season, emphasis on fringe. The big question marks are our unproven but quite talented freshman class (led by Vonleh, Williams, Fischer), how much improvement comes from our sophomores (mostly Perea and Hollowell), and leadership (Sheehey, Yogi, and hopefully Gordon and Etherington). Eric Gordon's younger brother Evan has transferred from ASU and will compete with Williams, etc. for starting 2 guard minutes. Crean basically plays 4 guards anyway so expect 3-4 of these 2 guards to get major minutes. We will be thinner down low so expect a perimeter oriented offense and fast break style surrounding Vonleh and Fischer/Perea. Defensively in the B1G we will be tested since we aren't big down low and won't have many big bodies off the bench.

* To Come: Tom Crean is ALWAYS recruiting so if someone checked back in next week our recruiting situation could be different. But our top priority is an elite point guard always. I'd say IU has as good of a chance to land Dante Exum as anyone, which isn't even that great of a chance. He could go pro after next year without coming to the states as he is from Australia. Also, Goodluck Okonoboh, Ahmed Hill, Phil Booth, etc. are on our radar. James Blackmon has already committed for 2014 and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpF4cI8Zzss) and others out there should speak for itself. Averaged something like 32 pts for his high school team and has done very well this summer also. Tre Lyles was committed before both parties realized IU wouldn't be a good fit. 
TL;DR we always are looking for good guards and wings and if we can land Okonoboh or another elite big man our 2014 class could be special.

*Random Tidbits*
***

* Larry Bird would have been a part of the 1976 undefeated IU team as a freshman.
* Bob Knight cried once describing how Isaiah Thomas was an ambassador of the game. He also stuffed an intern (secretary?) into a trashcan.
* Breaking Bad’s Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) attended IU
* IU hosts the largest collegiate bicycle race every year called the Little 500. It is generally a week of drinking and general debauchery, capped off by a relay bike race. A fictionalized version of this event and much of campus was featured in the movie [Breaking Away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Away). 
* For the years prior to Assembly Hall's renovation, IU's home win percentage was around .920
* After Bob Knight's first game as coach, IU player Steve Green got into a fist fight with an IU student who was trashing Knight's slow, motion offense, and team defense style of play. That student most likely came around as Knight's record in his first 5 years was 125-20.
* While we are regarded as a basketball school, it turns out IU’s soccer team has more NCAA soccer championships (8) than basketball (5), most recently with winning this past year’s college cup.
* A funny [mock campus tour video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCERVghyDms) since you made it all the way to the bottom.

I’m being completely impartial, and I’m truly asking out of curiosity. Do the failures of this season make you question whether actively seeking one-and-done players is the best way to build long-term success? Most Kentucky fans agree that even before Nerlens Noel’s injury this team lacked the motivation that comes with experience/discipline not typically found on a team of freshman. Are you okay with taking a risk year after year with players who have not played one minute of college ball? Are you okay with trading off one or two bad seasons for one great one? If so, how many bad seasons in a row would you be willing to tolerate before questioning Calipari’s current recruiting tactics?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the great responses! General consensus seems to be that, thanks to Kentucky winning the title last year, no one really has a problem with it, and most fans would trade one or two bad seasons for a national title. Agreed."	t5_2rj3j	True

Although we do our best to let the community self-moderate, I'd like to take a moment to point out a few things.

This is not a 'circle-jerk' sub for you to gang up with members of your fandom and downvote anyone who disagrees with you. The downvoted-past-collapse trend of valid opinions that are not shared by the majority, (like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/pm8zf/do_not_schedule_missouri_online_petition_by/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/pjtdv/ncaa_denies_connecticut_huskies_request_for_apr/)) needs to stop.

Although such behavior can be fun, please keep it to the 'trash-talk' threads we will be creating more frequently in the coming weeks. In normal, everyday threads...please *only* vote down if a comment does not add to the conversation or is trolling. Conversely, only upvote if the comment contributes to the discussion.

Again, I'd urge everyone to vote towards what kind of community you want to have on this sub. If every conversation devolves into 'whosoever fanbase is bigger and can up/downvote the most wins' then don't be surprised if a front page full of memes become the norm.

Just a humble note from your tireless spam filter cleaner.

Please know when you sign up that you MUST be able to get your stuff submitted by 12 p.m. Eastern on your scheduled day. If there's a sudden issue, just PM me and I can reschedule without a problem. 

* The template is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c6GwL2V-dCIpizeqX4Kb77uoIGPhVLpCFskbewnTSCo/edit?usp=sharing). 

* When you pick a day, please please please look to be sure that your date hasn't been filled with two teams yet. 

* We can go all the way to November if need be. Also, up to four are going to be allowed to work on a team, so just because there's a name there doesn't mean that you can't work on it.

On a side note, there are a few days that I won't be at the computer, due to a little traveling as well as my moving in around Aug. 23rd. Maybe not so much on the traveling days since they're just about all day trips, but definitely on the 23rd I'll need someone to take over for a day and make sure everything that day goes smoothly if someone signed up. Also, I'm giving everyone Independence Day off because 1) it's my favorite holiday and 2) we should be spending that time with friends and family instead of staring at screens half the day.

Are you serious? 

Firstly, let me state this so that I don't get downvoted into oblivion for being sexist: I am not bashing the WNBA. I am not talking down women's sports.

She has practically [no vertical jump](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIyiEHqt0g4). None.

They are nowhere *near* being comparable, yet somehow they are.

I just don't see how we can justify Griner to be NBA quality. Has anybody seen [this highlight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKDURd1Ee-I) of Louisville-Baylor? Yes, she can block shots. Yes, she can dunk, but she's honestly not that good of a player when you put her up against NBA professionals.

I know these are very debatable for the biggest moments (Tate George game winner vs. Clemson, Duke semi-final 2004, three national championship games).

2013-14 Season 

[Roster](http://articles.courant.com/2013-03-16/sports/hc-uconn-2013-14-roster-0317-20130316_1_shabazz-napier-kentan-facey-terrence-samuel) 

Since everyone will be returning this year, the starting 5 for this season should be similar to last year: Boatright, Napier, Calhoun, Daniels, Olander with incoming freshman Kentan Facey first off the bench. 

Schedule: No official schedule yet, however, UConn is slated to play a number of excellent out of conference games including: Maryland @ the Barclays Center, Boston College @ MSG, Washington (potentially twice based on how 2K Classic plays out), Florida @ home, and potentially Indiana (based on how 2K Classic plays out). [source] (http://www.ctpost.com/uconn/article/UConn-s-Ollie-girds-for-tough-non-conference-slate-4610060.php)


The Greats: Ray Allen, Kemba Walker, Emeka Okafor, Richard Hamilton, Ben Gordon, Rudy Gay, Charlie Villanueva, Caron Butler, Khalid El-Amin, Donyell Marshall, Hilton Armstrong, and many [more](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/961478-uconn-basketball-the-top-50-players-in-school-history)

Greatest Games: Some of the best games in UConn history include winning the 1999 National Championship against Duke for UConn’s first ever title, beating Duke again in the 2004 semi-final game before defeating Georgia Tech in the final for UConn’s second national championship, and winning eleven games in a row in the Big East tournament and National Tournament over opponents Depaul, Georgetown, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Louisville, Bucknell, Cincinnati, San Diego State, Arizona, Kentucky, and Butler. Also, beating #1 Texas at home in 2010, Washington in 1998 (see video above), Tate George’s game winner over Clemson, and Ray Allen’s game winning shot to win UConn’s first Big East championship.

Greatest Coach: [Jim Calhoun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokthY5zuPU). 866 wins all-time in Division I basketball, won 7 Big East Tournaments, 10 Big East Regular Season championships, 4 appearances in the Final Four, 3 National Championships, member of both the College Basketball and Basketball Hall of Fame, and helped [27](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Calhoun#Former_players) of his former players move on to professional careers.

Greatest Rivalries: With the creation of the Big East in 1979, UConn formed some incredible rivalries over the years until the conference’s demise in 2013. One opponent that UConn shared many unbelievable moments with was Syracuse. Every time these two foes met, you knew you were getting an intense, hard-fought, and entertaining game. These two schools played some fantastic games at Gampel Pavillion and the XL Center for UConn, the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, and many classics at Madison Square Garden.

[The Classic 6OT Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koPRFXzi3o)

[Final Matchup in the Big East](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrESgvt9Wkc)

UConn had many other well known clashes with other former Big East schools and other regional institutions such as Georgetown, Pittsburgh, Louisville, and Boston College. 

Traditions

1. At the beginning of every half, everyone stands and claps until UConn has scored their first basket of the period.

2. After a really good play for the Huskies and the opponent calls a timeout, [“Big Red”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0sMcPE1riQ) gets out of his seat and spells out U-C-O-N-N with his arms as the entire crowd recites the chant in sync.

Dough, now other options like Moe’s Southwest Grill and Mooyah Burger and Fries have entered the picture. If you are looking for a quality sit down meal, look no further than Geno’s Grill or a quick ride over to Willimantic to Willimantic Brewing Company. Breakfast options commonly chosen by students include Bagel Zone and the Wooden Spoon.

Random Trivia

1. The University of Connecticut Husky has a name: Jonathan. The name comes from Jonathan Trumbull, a former Connecticut governor and friend to President George Washington.

2. Before becoming the Huskies, the original UConn mascot was the Aggies.

3. UConn has won a total of 15 national championships: 3 in men’s basketball, 8 in women’s basketball, 3 in men’s soccer, and 2 in women’s field hockey.

4. In 2005, [Slate Magazine](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/2005/09/where_to_hide_from_mother_nature.html) concluded Storrs, CT to be the safest place to hide from natural disasters. 

5. UConn is famous for its Oozeball tournament every year during Spring Weekend. It has been voted ""Best Mud Volleyball in the Country"" by Sports Illustrated and number 33 on its list of the ""Top 100 Things To Do Before You Graduate: No Matter The Cost"" by On Campus magazine.

What Is and What is to Come

The 2012-2013 basketball season was a tough year for the University of Connecticut basketball team. In transition with a new head coach in Kevin Ollie and dealing with no postseason play due to NCAA sanctions, the huskies showed grit and toughness playing some great games exhibiting skill, athleticism, and heart.


The new season faces many more challenges entering a new conference, the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Everyone will be returning this year to the roster except for grad student R.J. Evans and big man Enosch Wolf’s future is still in limbo as the school awaits his decision on whether he will return to Storrs in the fall. This could create issues as the frontcourt is in need of help outside of DeAndre Daniels and Tyler Olander. Otherwise, the 2013-2014 season looks promising with Boatright and Napier still occupying one of the most dynamic backcourts in the country alongside a more seasoned Omar Calhoun. The most exciting recruit, Kentan Facey will be joining the huskies this fall and looks to jump into the rotation and provide value immediately. Facey, a Jamaican native, was fascinated by the University of Connecticut after watching Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb, and company go on their improbable run to win both the Big East and National Championships in 2011. Lasan Kromah is transferring from George Washington to help provide a deeper bench for Coach Ollie along with Neils Giffey and Leon Tolsdorf.


The extended future looks bright as well as Daniel Hamilton, a five star recruit from Los Angeles, recently committed to play basketball at UConn in the 2014-2015 season. In addition, former five star recruit Rodney Purvis is transferring from NC State to play for UConn in 2014. After initially considering UConn out of high school, he will sit out one year because of NCAA transfer rules and looks to take over the Husky backcourt in a year. So far, Kevin Ollie has done an excellent job recruiting despite NCAA sanctions and conference realignment. 

Even with weaker in conference play, the  UConn Athletic Director, Warde Manuel, has done an unbelievable job getting talented out of conference schools to play UConn at home, on the road, and at neutral sites. Finally, a brand new practice basketball facility is in the works. It will be located adjacent to Gampel Pavillion and looks to be [beautiful](http://blog.ctnews.com/elliott/files/2012/10/NightShot-SingleEntry-11.jpg). I as well as much of the UConn fan base are looking forward to the future of Husky basketball.

Those were Jim Boeheims words after cuses win. WOW. He may as well have pointed at the indiana coaching staff and said ""you guys did a shitty job of preparing your players."" Honestl,y Indianas players couldnt have looked less prepared for that zone. It was pathetic. I mean how many quality jumpers did they even get off?

The evil perwinkles have an early lead but I think the orangereds will make a comeback.

EDIT: 3:32 Orangered Standard Time. We've taken our first lead. Love live the Orangered.

Round 1 Over...evil blue/purple periwinkle won: http://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/1bgam7/round_1_over_round_2_begins/

EDIT 2: The evil reddit overlords are obviously periwinkle sympathizers. They reset the totals as soon as the superior race took the lead and yet somehow awarded periwinkle with the win. WE MUST OVERCOME THEIR TYRANNY!

EDIT 3: Orangered rightfully regains the lead! Upvote the superior orange brethren!

Because the admins need traffic for page-views...the battle [is now tied](http://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/1bgquz/round_2_complete_periwinkle_1_orangered_1_team/). Destroy the purple/blue menace in this final round!"	t5_2rj3j	True

The winners should have all received their prizes within the last week. If your name is on this list and  you haven't received the appropriate prize, message the mods and we'll get it straightened out.

Also, a special thanks to /u/offtherocks who also received Reddit Gold for putting together some awesome scripts to help us pull the leader information.

So why did this take so long? Because our three bonus prizes (biggest upset, perfect Final Four, and Perfect Tie-breaker score) ended up being more complicated to score than we anticipated because each subreddit was seperated out into a different group. It's something we'll keep in mind for next year. If you think you qualify for any of these prizes (again, 1 month Reddit Gold), shoot us a message. We'll work to verify your claim and see if the reddit admins are still willing to gift gold.

Sorry for the delay and congratulations to all the winners!

[Roster \(for now\)](http://www.fightingillini.com/sports/m-baskbl/m-baskbl-roster.html)

Schedule: Not Available Yet

**The Greats:**

**Greatest Games:**

*[Arizona vs. Illinois 2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXNQ4NJTYMc)*

Down 15 points with less than 4 minutes left in the Elite 8 Deron Williams lead the Fighting Illini back and ties the game sending it into overtime at 80-80. Illinois would then go on to win the game by 1 with Arizona missing a 3 point attempt at the buzzer, giving the Illini a 90-89 overtime win and a trip to the Final Four.

*[Illinois vs. Michigan State 1979](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=U3j_-XyQJIY)*

In a battle between two top 5 teams, #4 Illinois hosted #1 Michigan State in Assembly Hall. After a back and forth 2nd half, Steve Lanter with 15 seconds left passes to an open Eddie Johnson on the right baseline where Johnson hits a 15-foot jumper with 4 seconds left. With the 57-55 win, Illinois had beaten a No. 1-ranked team for the first time in school history.

*Illinois vs. UCLA 1964*

This was the season after UCLA’s first championship under John Wooden, and Illinois went into Los Angeles and defeated the 2nd ranked Bruins 110-83. Six different Illini scored double figures, and broke a school record by shooting 58% from the field. Coach Wooden regarded this game as “probably the worst lacing” of his coaching career in his memoir, “They Call Me Coach”. 

**Greatest Players:**

* [ Dee Brown

* [ Deron Williams

* [ Nick Anderson
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Anderson)

* [Kendall Gill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Gill)

**Greatest Rivalries:**

*[Illinois vs. Missouri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braggin'_Rights)*

I personally enjoy the Braggin’ Rights game every year between Mizzou and the Illini. Overall, the Illini hold the 20-11 lead over the Tigers, but Missouri has won the past 4 years. It is held every year in St. Louis, a neutral location, always drawing a huge crowd and is played on national television. It is a bit of a streaky rivalry, with Illinois winning 9 straight between 2000 and 2008, 8 in a row between 1983 and 1990, and Missouri with multiple win streaks of 4 in a row. Unlike most rivalries where the trophy travels home with the winning team, the trophy is displayed in a glass case in the Scottrade Center lobby, where it occupies either an orange-and-blue or black-and-gold space in the cabinet, depending on who won. The unoccupied side has a plastic square reading “THE TROPHY BELONGS HERE NEXT YEAR” in the position where the trophy would go.

Any B1G fan will tell you that every conference game has the intensity of a rivalry game, but for the Illini in particular our biggest rivals in conference include Wisconsin, Ohio State, Northwestern, and Indiana.

**Greatest Games:** 

*Purdue vs. Marquette – 1969*

With just seconds left in the game, Purdue’s Rick Mount (also the first high schooler to be featured on the cover of [Sports Illustrated](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/1f/71f0dd85-23ed-5a74-b61e-872246966556/4efd3e55378e4.preview-620.jpg)) made a deep baseline jumper to defeat Marquette, sending Purdue to the Final Four. Purdue went on to face UCLA in the championship game, losing to who else but John Wooden.

In overtime, IU hit a three point shot with under 30 seconds remaining to tie the game at 87. Chad Austin of Purdue then proceeded to hit a jumper with 0.6 seconds on the clock to hush the Bloomington crowd and give Purdue another victory in the Purdue-IU rivalry



**Greatest Players:** 

[John Wooden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden) (1929-1933)

[Glenn Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_robinson) (1992-1994)

[Rick Mount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Mount) (1967-1970)

[Terry Dischinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Dischinger) (1959-1962)

**Greatest Coaches:** 

[Gene Keady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_keady) – 1980-2005 (512-270)

[Matt Painter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Painter) – 2005-present (176-95)

**Greatest Rivalries:** 

[Purdue vs. IU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana%E2%80%93Purdue_rivalry#Men.27s_basketball) – This rivalry dates back (for basketball) to March 2, 1901. Purdue leads the all-time series by a count of 112-88 and it is this rivalry which led Bob Knight to throw a chair across the floor as a Purdue player took technical free throws. The rivalry is filled with hatred. Lots of it. The rivalry extends well beyond basketball too, reaching into other athletics and into academics as well. 


Purdue vs. Michigan State – This is a rivalry which has really come about in recent years, and this is the best way to describe it. Purdue is the semi-nerdy kid at school, yet his glasses and boyish charm, along with his wit and smarts, cause him to be well liked across the board. Well, every year, Purdue decides to ask one of the prettiest girls in school (a recruit) to prom. She never quite says yes, but she totally hints that she wants to go to prom with Purdue. Purdue makes dinner reservation and even gets a tie to match his date’s dress. Then, the night before prom, Michigan State, who is dumber than Purdue, but much more athletic and better looking, asks Purdue’s date to prom. She says yes and Purdue is stuck staring at the punch bowl all night filled with anger as Michigan State dances the night away. Basically, Michigan State comes into Indiana and takes many of our targets because they are a much sexier pick. Because of this and just two physical teams going head to head, this match-up has become one to look forward to every year.

*Traditions*
****
[Breakfast Club:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University#Breakfast_Club) On the morning of home football games, bars open at the crack of dawn welcoming hundreds of fans dressed in costumes of all sorts starting their game days off right. 

[Grand Prix:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Grand_Prix) the Grand Prix is a 50-mile go-kart race which is known as “The Greatest Spectacle in College Racing” which takes place every April. The karts are made from the ground up by student teams. This event tops off a week known as “Grand Prix Week” where you pretty much have an excuse to be drinking and partying around the clock. But there are also many other events that go on throughout the week as well.

[The Purdue Drum:](http://ecampusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Purdue-Largest-Drum.jpg) Purdue has the world’s largest drum, or at least it is called. It is an instrumental (pun intended) part of the All-American Marching band at Purdue, standing 10 feet tall. 

[Old Oaken Bucket:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Oaken_Bucket) Way back when, some Purdue and IU alumni found an [old bucket](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me4scpY52g1r7gaer.jpg) on a farm in southern Indiana and said “whoever wins the Purdue versus IU football game gets this bucket.” And it has stuck. Each year, whoever wins gets to add either a “P” or an “I” to chain on the bucket.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***
**City Population:** West Lafayette, IN (29,596)

[**City Skyline**](https://marketing.purdue.edu/Toolkit/PhotoGalleries/Landscape-Aerial/aerial_campus_main.jpg) 
  
**Iconic Campus Buildings:** 

[University Hall](http://www.cla.purdue.edu/buildings/university.html) – Built in 1871, it is the oldest building on Purdue’s campus. [John Purdue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Purdue) (the founder) requested that no building be taller than University Hall. However, two buildings are taller. To find the loophole, one building is technically a “bridge”, as seen here, so it is not considered an actual building. The other building, Beering Hall, is a few floors taller. Solution? Give the top couple of floors a different zip code so that they are not technically part of campus.

[Bell Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Bell_Tower) – Thought it is just under 20 years old, the Purdue Bell Tower is perhaps the most iconic structure on campus. It “rings” every quarter, half, and full hour. It also plays the fight song and alma mater at 12:20 pm, 5:00 pm, and 10 pm. The reason “rings” is in “quotations” is that though bells exist, the sounds are all played through speakers because the tower structurally cannot actually have real bells swinging without it falling (apparently). Also, it is said that if you walk under the Bell Tower during your time at Purdue, you will not graduate in four years.

[Elliot Hall of Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Hall_of_Music) – Elliot is an auditorium with a capacity larger than Radio City Music Hall and a stage as large as that at the Dolby Theatre. Holding just over [6,000 people](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/7578380720_94fab26a27_z.jpg), Elliot Hall of Music is one of the largest indoor theatres in the country. Elliot has hosted some of the biggest names in music and entertainment (Reddit plug: Neil deGrasse Tyson will be there in September). Also, Elliot regularly hosts exams for students. Rarely will you leave Purdue without taking at least one exam in the Hall of Music.

**Local Dining:** 

[Triple XXX](https://triplexxxfamilyrestaurant.com/) – As you approach Purdue from the southwest, you pass an orange and black old drive-in diner. And if you don’t stop there to eat, you’re missing out. Named for the root beer, Indiana’s oldest drive-in has sat just off of campus since 1929. It’s so good, Guy Fieri came and visited. But seriously, they have an amazing menu featuring the Duane Purvis (peanut butter burger), the Drew Brees (the breakfast combo he used to get when was a student) and as of seriously like, 4 days ago, the David Boudia. If you visit West Lafayette, you can’t miss out on Triple XXX.

[Harry’s Chocolate Shop](http://www.harryschocolateshop.com/) – No chocolate. As the story goes, during prohibition (since Harry’s opened in 1919), the chocolate shop served as a speakeasy. The password to get in was “go ugly early” which remains the staple phrase even to this day. Harry’s sits a block away from campus along State Street and is perhaps the most popular bar in the area. It is definitely one of those places you need to go even just to say you have been when visiting Purdue.

***
**Greatest Players:**    

* **Gary Thompson** - First Iowa State player to score over 1000 career points. Beat out Wilt Chamberlain in the 1956-1957 season for the Big Seven Player of the Year. Also helped Iowa State to the College World Series in 1957 playing shortstop. Retired number (#20) at Iowa State.      
* **Don Smith** - Known as Zaid Abdul Aziz in the NBA, was ISU's first top 5 selection in the draft. Holds many records at Iowa State. Big Eight Player of the Year in 1968. Number (#35) is also retired.      
* **Jeff Grayer** - Set all-time individual scoring record at Iowa State at 2,502 in his career. Three-time all-Big Eight, and three-time All-American. Played for 1988 Olympic team. Also retired number (#44).      
* **Fred Hoiberg** - Home grown in Ames, Fred Hoiberg is passionately referred to as “The Mayor” when he received write in votes during the 1993 mayor election for Ames. He is in the Top 7 of almost every single statistical category at Iowa State. His number (#37) is retired and hangs in Hilton.      
* **Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley** - We list these two together as they were the force behind two of the best Iowa State basketball seasons. Boasting a 34-0 home record while they played at Iowa State. 1999-2000 season these players helped Iowa State to a 14-2 Big 12 record and a Big 12 championship. Fizer was a consensus All-American. Big 12 Player of the Year. That team lost in the Elite Eight to Michigan State and was referred to as the “de-facto national championship game” by many sports writers.    
2000-01 saw Fizer leave for the NBA. But Tinsley led Iowa State to another Big 12 Championship and Tinsley winning Big 12 Player of the Year. *No one knows ^what ^happened ^^after ^^^that.*       

***
**Greatest Coaches:**     

* **Larry Eustachy** - Won Iowa State’s only Big 12 titles. AP National Coach of the Year. 2 time Big 12 Coach of the Year. Took Iowa State to the Elite Eight. Holds record for most games won in a season at 32. [Holds the record for longest home winning streak at 39 games.](http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=205823409) He resigned in 2003 after pictures surfaced of him drinking and partying at Kansas State and Mizzou. It is widely believed that our AD at the time forced him to resign instead of letting him go through rehab for his alcohol problem. Most fans resented this about the AD since we promoted from within to a guy who couldn’t coach. Who was that AD? The [same guy](http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2013-06-27/louisiana-tech-ad-resigning-bruce-van-de-velde-bowl-snafu-stepping-down) who couldn’t get 9-3 Louisana Tech into a bowl game.      
* **Johnny Orr** - Orr came to Iowa State via Michigan in 1980. The Iowa State AD wanted to hire one of Orr’s assistants but once learning how much Iowa State was going to pay he took the job instead. The man responsible for Hilton Magic.

* [**Hilton Magic**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Coliseum#Hilton_Magic) - The Magic is the power of the Cyclones to pull off amazing upsets. It was first coined on 14 Feb 1989 when a Des Moine Register writer covered the upset over then #3 Mizzou with a packed coliseum. The writer called for more magic, and the fans showed up in force the next game against OSU, who had beaten ISU 102-74 three weeks earlier. The Cyclones pulled a 90-81 turnaround that officially solidified Hilton Magic as something real. Often attributed to the coliseum’s structure of thick concrete, steel doors, and close seating, the crowd is often one of the largest and loudest in CBB, helping the team to attain some of the longest home win streaks in the nation.     

* [**Cyclone Alley**](http://www.cyclonealley.org/) - The name for the student section. A committee run giveaways and coordinate other stuff for the other students. The students take up the entire strip from behind both boards, and for big games typically go all the way up to the rafters ([Picture](http://i.imgur.com/aLR0vNw.jpg). Students also embrace the giant heads, insulting signs, crazy costumes, and the occasional dance fad. - [1](http://i.imgur.com/NXypFdd.jpg) - [2](http://i.imgur.com/eXGOWcW.jpg) - [Giant Niang](http://i.imgur.com/6SIy4Wp.jpg) - [Harlem Shake ^^*sigh*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2maaprwncgw)

* The only real song that is of any relevance is Blue and White which is the fight song.

* However, the Cameron Crazies are notorious for their chants. Many of you may not know how the chants work, for you folks I'd love to explain. Basically there are leaders of the chants that come up with a list and hand them out before games so everyone knows them. Then those leaders call them out and then the chants begin. Both section 17 (The Crazies) and the band section have their own leaders and chants. The games are amazing because of this awesome group of fans.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Heading into the 2012-13 season I had high hopes just as every year, however, unlike most Duke fans I just didn't seem to believe any of the hype once the season started. I felt that just like the year before Duke didn't have a dominate go-to scorer that could handle the game late and close-out or keep them in games. The team was playing very well excluding rebounding but still, I thought they just weren't in the same league as Indiana, Michigan, or Louisville. Then when Ryan Kelly went out I was certainly worried.


Duke struggled at times with Kelly out, especially on defense, but once he returned and they beat Miami in an epic game I thought just maybe they could go all the way but I still wasn't overly confident.

After a poor showing in the ACC tournament Duke moved into the NCAA tournament easily the most challenging region in the bracket with teams such as Oregon at a 12 seed. After a great win against Michigan State and Sparty it was time to rematch Lousiville. Of course Duke had beaten Louisville earlier in the year at the Battle for Atlantis but this time they had Dieng back. Basically everyone saw that game which was brutal to watch for any Duke fan or fan in general in regards to Kevin Ware. Congrats to Louisville, I rooted for them after they beat Duke considering I didn't want Duke to lose to a loser! haha Moving on...

***

Looking ahead to the 2013-14 season, I am very excited. I feel like Duke is ready to explode with one of the best offenses in the entire country next year. I expect them to play some intense defense with Cook, Sulaimon, and Hood all doing tons of ball pressuring which will add an interesting and new element to the Duke basketball culture seeing as how Duke hasn't been the most athletic team lately. This defensive pressure mixed with one of the most explosive offensives on paper in the NCAA and I believe that Duke should be a serious threat, maybe THE favorite, to win it all next year.

I think many people should be excited to see Rodney Hood [(Small video here of him)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PccUhgjv-k8). It was talked about often last year among the Duke community that he was the most talented player on that team without contest. Coach Wojo said in an interview that there was no player like him in the country and that he was a superstar ready to explode onto the scene. The kid has a great lefty stroke and is very, very versatile. He's able to defend at a high level due to his elite athleticism which will be advantageous offensively in transition as well. He loves to pass and is also able to handle the ball with confidence. I believe that with him and Jabari Parker on the wing, as well as returning SG Rasheed Sulaimon, that Duke has the best wing trio in the country. Here's to hoping for a successful season in the new ACC and ring number 5 for Coach K...

*The Greats*

**Greatest Games** 

[NC State 103 Maryland 100 OT 1974 ACC Championship game](http://home.earthlink.net/~charlottewolf/greatest_college_basketball_game.htm) 

Many dubbed this as the greatest game ever played at that time. Back when conferences could only send 1 team to the NCAA tournament and the ACC had 4 teams in the top 10 that year. NC State and Maryland were both ranked in the top 4 or 5 almost all year, and met with everything on the line, as only one team could move on. The linked John Feinstein article can do the game more justice than I can.

[NC State 80 UCLA 77 2 OT 1974 Final 4](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1088398/)

What many viewed as the title game that year. I bet most people other than State and Marquette fans even know that NC State beat Marquette in the final. Most people I know assume we beat UCLA that year in the final, and it's because of the greatness of this game.

[NC State 52 Houston 50, 1983 NCAA championship game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puQvU4PBzhI)

One of biggest upsets in NCAA history. Similar to our 1974 semifinal with UCLA, everyone considered the matchup between Houston and Louisville to be the seminal title game, as it was assumed that either team would smash NC State. Then the miracle occurred. If watching Jim Valvano run around, desperately searching for someone to hug, doesn't make you smile, then i'm not sure what will.

[NC State 69 Pepperdine 67 2 OT NCAA 1st round](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDMjFQ-Kjsk) 
NC State came back from a 8 pt deficit with under a minute to go, and won the game in double overtime.

**Greatest Players:**

[David ""Skywalker"" Thompson 1972-1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thompson_(basketball))

Greatest Player in NC State history. One of the best in NCAA history. 1st overall pick in 1975 NBA draft. If his career weren't derailed by his addiction problems he would likely have gone down as one of the greatest in the NBA as well. Many believe that the obsession and measuring of vertical leap in the NBA began because of him. [Video discussing his jumping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQPVKQIFxVk)

[Dereck Whittenburg 1979-1983](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereck_Whittenburg)

Mr. Clutch on the 1983 title team. whenever the team needed a clutch basket, the ball was always in his hands. Phenomenal shooter.

[Chris Corchiani 1988-1991](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Corchiani)

The ""fire"" of the ""fire and ice"" backcourt with Rodney Monroe. He was a sparkplug of the later Valvano teams, adn was the soul of those teams. As of his graduation he was the NCAA D1's all time career assist leader although he was passed a few years later by Bobby Hurley from Duke. He still sits 2nd all time.

Other Notable players: Dick Dickey, Tom Burleson, Monte Towe, Thurl Bailey, Sidney Lowe, Rodney Monroe, Tom Gugliotta, Julius Hodge

**Greatest Coaches**[Everett Case 1946-1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Case)

One of the founding father's of ACC basketball. He is often credited with the rise in popularity of basketball in North Carolina. He is also credited with starting practices such as cutting down the nets after winning a championship, and shining a spotlight on players during introductions. He won 6 Southern conference championships, 4 ACC championships, and was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 1982. Legend has it that he asked to be buried facing Highway 70, so that he could cheer on the Wolfpack as they travelled down the road towards Durham and Chapel Hill.

[Norm Sloan 1966-1980](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Sloan)

Took NC State to new heights, culminating in the 1974 NCAA championship. He won 3 ACC titles in his career, in 1970, 1973, and 1974. Known as ""Stormin Norman"" for his legendary battles with Dean Smith at UNC and Lefty Driesell at Maryland. Also legendary for his [famous sportscoat](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3015/2289099742_d35eeca80a_z.jpg). He was famous for never signing a contract with NC State. At the end of every season he walked into the AD's office and asked him if they were on for another year. Upon finding out that he was earning far less than rivals Smith and Driesell he began disputing with the AD, and ultimately resigned and began coaching at Florida. his resignation ultimately led to us hiring...

[Jim Valvano 1980-1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Valvano)

Jimmy V. The one and only. Had one of the largest personalities I can rfemember in College coaching. Famous not only for winning the 1983 NCAA title, but also for his public bout with cancer. [His ESPY speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoVM9nm42E) will go down in history as one of the best inspiration speeches ever. To learn more about the cause he championed so greatly, please visit his foundation site. [Jimmy V Foundation](http://www.jimmyv.org/)

**Greatest Rivalries**

*NC State vs UNC* In recent years this has been more fierce on the football field, but it is a rivalry in most every sport. Some younger UNC fans will try to argue that it is not a rivalry, but anyone who knows the history of the two schools knows how big of a rivalry this is. [Just ask Roy Williams](http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/46166/roy-williams-does-not-like-nc-state).

*NC State vs Duke* A rivalry borne mostly out of proximity and a mutual hatred of UNC. There is a rivalry none the less. Going back to Norm Sloan and Vic Bubas. They were college teammates at NC State, Bubas went on to coach Duke, Sloan to NC state and they had many classic matchups. [Duke's site explains it far more in depth]{http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&amp;ATCLID=205078966).

*Traditions*
***
1. During the National Anthem, everyone in the student section and many of the rest of the crowd, yell out ""RED!"" when the national anthem reaches ""Rocket's *red* glare"", and then end it with ""Home of the Wolfpack!"" Some have said its offensive, but I tell them to get that stick out of their ass. 

2. The band performs a ""fast fight song"" at each game where they sprint to the four sides of the court and play a very fast version. Then they spring back to their corner, and begin to play a very slow version while the crowd claps slowly. the clapping slowly picks up as the band's speed picks up and its time so they are back to normal speed when we yell out ""GO State"" in the song.

*Non-Sports traditions*

1. [Krispy Kreme Challenge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3YyIkmPKEQ)

The original. 5 miles, 12 doughnuts, 1 hour. Can you do it?

2. Hillsborough Hike-Every holiday and other random times, students go to Hillsborough St. adjacent to main campus for a huge bar crawl. Biggest ones are Halloween and the end of Fall term.

*What is and What is to come*
***
For many the 2012-2013 season was a bitter disappointment. A season that began with so much hope and so much promise ended suddenly in the 1st round of the NCAA tournament. It speaks to how quickly we have started to get back on our feet after some down times, that 24 wins and an 8 seed in the tourney can be considered an utter failure, but a failure is what it was. Outside of Richard Howell, who constantly amazed the ACC with his effort, tenacity, and outstanding rebounding, it's difficult to pick out any other NC State player and say that they improved from 2011 to now. Leslie and Brown seemed to have stagnated in their growth, or even regressed. Scott Wood has always been a great shooter, but never was able to add much else to his game. Rodney Purvis didn't really live up to the expectations that were laid on him as he got to campus. There were some highs, such as beating Duke and UNC in the same year for the first time since 2003. The Wolfpack also became the 9th team in ACC history to have four 1,000 point scorers on the team at the same time (Wood, Leslie, Brown, Howell).

The 2013-14 season will see a new beginning and a new era in Raleigh. 5 of our top 6 players from last season are now gone, including Leslie and Brown leaving early, Howell and Scott Wood graduating, and Rodney Purvis transferring. NC State adds a good recruiting class led by MCD's all-american Anthony ""Cat"" Barber to pair with good returners Tyler Lewis and TJ Warren. TJ Warren will be asked to shoulder much of the scoring load this season, as most of the points from last year are gone, but scoring is something that he is particularly adept at. Tyler Lewis and Cat Barber will give us our PG play, and LSU transfer Ralston Turner and JUCo pickup Desmond Lee will add to Warren on the wings. A trio of freshman will pair with senior benchwarmer extraordinaire Jordan vandenberg, 4 star recruits BeeJay Anya and Kyle Washington, and 3 star Lennard Freeman. This season should be an interesting one for the Wolfpack, as many newcomers and freshman will be asked to play huge minutes. The early season should be a struggle as the guys are learning, but there is certainly talent there if they are able to figure it out.

We have a few announcements and reminders about how our community works.

###Bracket Challenge###

Yes, we have a bracket challenge. Yes, it's free to enter. Yes, there are prizes. No, you can't enter more than once. [You can find out all the information here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1agud4/announcement_reddit_bracket_challenge/)

###Quality of Content and Discussion##

In internet culture, it's called [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September). In college basketball, it's called freshmen. But regardless of what you call it, we want to remind our older subscribers and teach our newer ones about the type of community we enjoy hear at /r/collegebasketball.

This isn't the ESPN Comments Section. Please help us keep it that way. We encourage intelligent, substantial submissions and discussion about all things college basketball.

- **Please DO follow good [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) when commenting and voting.**
- **Please DO check the New Queue before making a submission.** This is especially important over the next few weeks because we anticipate a lot of duplicate game threads and game recaps to be posted.
- **Please DO consider whether your submission belongs in a [team-specific subreddit instead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1alhpd/a_bigger_better_list_of_teamspecific_subreddits/)**
- **Please DO NOT vote based on team affiliation or difference of opinion.** If you choose to downvote, make sure its for valid reasons (it helps to explain why you're downvoting). Also, remember that this cuts both ways: you shouldn't downvote fans of your rivals just because they're fans of your rivals, but you also shouldn't upvote fans of your team just because they're fans of your team.
- **Please DO NOT make lazy submissions.** These include memes, image macros, lazy text posts, etc.

###Trash Talk Threads##

Please follow the guidelines above to help us maintain quality *most of the time*. The one exception is with our Trash Talk threads. The moderators will be posting new Trash Talk threads throughout the tournament and [you can read though old ones here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/collegebasketball/search?q=flair%3A%27trashtalk%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

###Game Threads##

The moderators will not be posting game threads this year. Instead, you are welcome to post game threads for any game (NCAA, NIT, CBI, CIT) that you'd like to discuss. Again, please check the new queue before submitting. [The template for creating a game thread is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/14wlx3/game_thread_format/)

###New Look and Feel##

If you're a longtime reader and you've made it this far, you've probably noticed that things look a little different today. We unveiled a new stylesheet today that we think is a little more clean, sharp, and visually consistent. But it's only the first in what will hopefully be a number of new visual and functional improvements to this subreddit.

No, it doesn't work perfectly with RES Night Mode. But then again, neither did the old one. It's something we'll look into supporting in the future.

Let us know if you have any feedback, suggestions, questions, or concerns.

We need to talk.

Despite having a very large response to the request for pollsters we've had a HUGE drop-off. To put it into context, despite having around 75 users that committed, we've had around 30 actual ballots the last two weeks.

So the first part of this is to seek input. Is there something about the format pollsters are finding impossible to work with? Currently the poll is open from Wednesday night through Friday. The reason for this was to incorporate more games than the 'official' polls so ours were always different. The release would also give us something to discuss on Fridays (usually our sports slowest day). Is that what is causing the problem?

Second, we've been lax on calling out people not submitting polls. Because of the length of the season we started off saying we'd let people miss three weeks or even more as long as they told us before the voting deadline. The result is about half the voters not voting the first full month of the poll. Personally I think we should be more strict as a response; what do you think?

Pollsters, are emails not getting to you? We send a reminder weekly and yet many are still missing the deadlines.

Lastly; if anyone would like to participate and will actually do a ballot every week please send me a PM. Depending on how this thread goes I'm considering dropping anyone who has missed more than one ballot at this point.

*Random Trivia*
***
U of L is ranked 5th all time in NCAA tournament appearances with 39, ranked 6th in tournament wins with 70, and 6th in Final Four appearances with 10.

Three members of Louisville have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame: Wes Unseld, Denny Crum, and Rick Pitino.

Rick Pitino is the only coach in NCAA history to have coached 3 teams (Providence, Kentucky, and Louisville) into the Final Four.

In 2013, U of L became the first team in NCAA history to appear in the Final Four, a BCS Bowl game, and the College World Series.

U of L basketball teams have garnered the (somewhat affectionate) nickname 'The Cardiac Cards' for their knack of making easy games seem hard and pulling out hard fought victories in the final seconds. Which leads me to...

Also, the Yum Center sells bourbon, so come on by and see us!

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Well, the 2012-13 season was a great one for U of L basketball, and all Cardinal sports for that matter. We won our 3rd National Championship in school history, our Women's basketball team shocked the world by defeating Brittney Griner and Baylor en route to the National Championship game, our football team overcame the odds and the doubters to defeat Florida in the Sugar Bowl, and our baseball team reached the College World Series for the second time. It's been a great year to be a Louisville Cardinal, but rather than become complacent and satisfied with our many accomplishments this year, we should look to compound our achievements and build our school and programs into a national standard. Looking forward, going from National Champions to being in the lowly interim American Athletic Conference is a pretty big let-down, but after that, we are extremely excited to face the great competition the ACC will provide us! I'm certain our players and fans see a bright future ahead of us!

*2012-13 Season*

**Record:** [23-12 (11-7 ACC)](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/page/UVA/virginia-cavaliers) 
**Coach:** Tony Bennett, assisted by Ritchie McKay, Jason Williford, Ron Sanchez	 
**Key Players:** 

* Senior Joe Harris: 6-6 Guard/Wing. First team All-ACC. Lead UVa with 16.3 PPG, shot 42.5% from 3, and is the key component to a successful 2013-14. His primary threat is his ability to shoot from anywhere, but he is deceptively athletic and can put the ball on the floor and create by himself, just ask Rasheed Sulaimon... 
* Senior Akil Mitchell: 6-8 Forward, but played a lot of time at the 5 last season out of necessity. Third team All-ACC. Quietly had a great season, averaged 13.1 PPG and 8.3 RPG while going against taller and bigger PFs and Cs nearly every week. He more than held his own last year and with more big man depth this coming season he should shine at his much more natural 4 position.
* Sophomore Justin Anderson: 6-6 Guard/Wing, but played 2/3/4 last season. He is an athletic freak and can jump out of the building; he had more highlight reel blocks and dunks than I can remember. He’s an excellent defender, and was asked to guard everyone from Seth Curry to Alex Len at times. He really came on strong towards the end of his first year and should be poised to be a starter and important piece of this year’s squad. If you don’t know who Justin Anderson is...

* [The Good ole Song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Old_Song): Sung after each game, to the tune of Auld Lang Syne. Not actually the fight song.
* Lingo: It’s not a “Campus”, it’s “Grounds” (the story goes that Mr. Jefferson believed that learning should not be confined to a campus). You’re not a “Freshman” or “Sophmore” or etc, you’re a “First Year”, “Second Year”, etc (Mr. Jefferson believed that one could never become a “Senior” in their learning).

*Random Trivia*
***
* EMBRACE THE PACE: UVa plays one of the slowest paces in the country, KenPom’s tempo metric puts us at 328 out of 347 teams, but for most of the 2013 season we sat around 340. Tony Bennett’s offensive philosophy preaches efficiency, “giving up good looks for great looks”, even if it means using all of the shot clock.
* Defense, Defense, Defense: UVa plays Tony Bennett’s “Pack Line” philosophy, pioneered by his father Dick Bennett at Wisconsin. The pack line is a sagging man to man defense where the off ball defenders sag into the imaginary “pack line” about 3-5 feet inside the 3 point line, denying penetration and forcing contested outside shots. Defense comes first for Bennett, always, and we’ve seen the transfer of several players not seeing the floor because they couldn’t grasp the defensive concepts.
* Both of those combine to make UVa one of the most “ugly” playing teams in the country, I love it though, and most other UVa fans agree considering we go absolutely NUTS for a shot clock violation. Every possession is a grind, and every single shot has to be earned by the opposing team. Defense is beautiful.
* Tony Bennett still holds the All Time NCAA 3 point % record from his playing days at UW-Green Bay. He shot 49.7% for his career from 3.
* Thomas Jefferson only requested 3 of his many achievements be included on his gravestone; Author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, as well as Father of the University of Virginia. 
* UVA has been the #1 or #2 ranked public university every year since the rankings started and is currently the 24th best overall college in the country, according to US News &amp; World Report

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Depending on who you ask, 2012-13 was either a good year or a complete disappointment. Coming into the season we were picked to finish 7th in the ACC after the departure of All-ACC Senior Mike Scott to the NBA. In that regard, we finished well above expectations at 4th in the ACC, a NCAA bubble team, and ended up losing to the eventual NIT champs in the quarter final. The highs were tremendously high, with signature wins over #3 Duke, UNC, #18 NC State, and @Wisconsin, but the lows were even lower with losses to ODU, @BC, Delaware, and a smattering of other mediocore teams. Considering we were one of the youngest teams in the ACC and the low expectations, I consider the season a resounding success. 

We head into 2013-14 with 2 legitimate All-ACC caliber players (Sr. Joe Harris and Sr. Akil Mitchell), and two others (super athlete So. Justin Anderson, and 7ft So. Mike Tobey) who have to potential to be very, very good. We also have one of the deepest teams in UVa history with considerable playable depth at every position, and 12 scholarship players ready to contribute. The only large question mark is who emerges at PG out of the 4 options we have. Here’s how I see our lineup shaking out. PG- RSo Malcolm Brogdon, SG- Sr. Joe Harris, SF- So. Justin Anderson, PF- Sr. Akil Mitchell, C- So. Mike Tobey. This would put our 5 best players on the court, and would still be a very tall (shortest player is 6-5 PG), lanky, and defensive-minded team. The bench would be, F- RSo Anthony Gill, F- Jr. Darion Atkins, F- So. Evan Nolte, G- So. Taylor Barnette, G- So. Teven Jones, G- Fr. London Perrantes, G- Fr. Devon Hall. Brogdon can also play the 2 so it’s possible either Jones, Perrantes, or Hall gets extra time at PG.

All in all, this is the year. This will be Bennett’s 5th year at the helm, he now has all his own players from top to bottom, the system is in place, and everyone that’s left has bought in. After making the NCAA tournament in 2011-12, and a deep-ish NIT run in 2012-13, anything short of a NCAA Sweet 16 would be a disappointment. We’ve seen UVA compete at a high level for the past 2 years, albeit somewhat inconsistently, but now it’s time to see whether we can take the next step into the national spotlight.

Personal Tirade: MIKE SCOTT SHOULD HAVE WON 2012-13 ACC-POY OVER ZELLER. Pace adjusted, Scott was better in the vast majority of the relevant stats and he did it all while being the only real scoring threat on the team, meanwhile Zeller’s stats are inflated by UNC’s up tempo and McDonald’s Burger Boys at every single position. The dirty, dirty PACISTS and Carolina-blue media robbed Scott of what was rightfully his.

1331527389.0	qshnr	I made a spreadsheet that calculates odds for each round. Let me know what you think.	dannylandulf	95	7	61	"First off, I assigned each team a 'power score' combining their RPI with their Kenpom ratings. For example, Kentucky's RPI is .6711 and it's Kenpom rating is .9671. Average together their 'power score' become .8191.

Basically I used then used Kenpom's formula for calculating the chances of any given match-up by substituting each teams power score into this equations: (A-A*B)/(A+B-2*A*B).

To be clear, this shows if the teams played 100 times...what percentage would each team be *likely* to win.

The formula accounts for each round and factors in the chances of even *making* that round due to previous round percentages. It's a lot of work to make the whole bracket in a readable format but if this is upvoted enough and there is a enough interest I'll do that for you guys. Anyways, here are the top line results:

1364183512.0	1aydnu	A word about the end of the Miami-Illinois game...	lasttoknow	116	28	63	"First I'd like to say how great the game was.  It was back and forth the whole time and neither team was the clear front-runner at any point.  
  
Having said that, that call at the end was clearly botched.  It sucks that stuff like that can't be reviewed.  To say that was the reason Miami won is disingenuous to how well the game went down the whole time.  Both sides played hard the whole time.  Nobody knows would've happened if they got the ball.  Plus, why the hell didn't they foul Reggie Johnson right after that?  He was clearly weak all game and is obviously worse than Larkin, but that's who they decided to foul instead.  
  
What upset me was the clear unsportsmanlike attitude in the game thread.  Anyone expressing that they believed the call didn't decide the game was downvoted to hell.  Any Miami fan expressing any sort of excitement for the win was downvoted.  I know the B1G love is strong in this sub, but come on.  Miami fought hard and deserved the win, despite the call.  Saying otherwise is just petty and rude."	t5_2rj3j	True

**History**

*The Good Old Glory Days*

   As you can tell by the years of our conference championships, the history of Wisconsin Badger basketball has been very hit and miss (and sadly, more often it has been a miss). Our program started strong in the early 1900s, as we had back to back undefeated seasons in 1912-1913 and 1913-1914, led by our head coach Dr. James C Elsom. More than half of Wisconsin’s Big Ten championships came before 1930, showing not only how strong we were in this time, but also how weak the program would become. 
But not yet! In 1934, Bud Foster became the head coach of the Wisconsin Badger basketball team. In just his first season he led the Badgers to a regular season conference championship, making it their 12th title in 28 years. Several years later, in 1941, he led us to our first and only national championship, beating Washington State 39-34 in the title game (and what a beautiful score that is!). 
The Dark Ages

   Now, after this, it gets pretty dark. Foster stuck around 1959, but only returned to the NCAA tournament once (1947). The records during the rest of his tenure were utterly uninspiring as well, but it gets worse. Between 1959 and 1995, the Badgers only had 8 winning seasons (and only 4 winning Big Ten records). Needless to say, this was the dark period of our program. A few NIT appearances and a return to the NCAA tournament in 1994 helped end it, but our program was still not considered a power by any stretch of the imagination.

*Something Good Brewing*

   In 1995, Dick Bennett (father of Tony Bennett) became the head coach after coaching at UW – Green Bay. He would reach the NIT tournament in his first year as well as post a winning record in Big Ten play (the first since 1974). He would also help the Badgers reach the NCAA tournament three times in his next four years, ending it with a run to the Final Four in 2000. 

   As an 8 seed in the 2000 NCAA tournament, the Badgers started the tournament by defeating #9 Fresno State 66 – 56. They would then upset #1 Arizona to the tune of 66 – 59, sending them to the Sweet Sixteen, the first time they would get out of the first weekend since the Bud Foster era. Notching wins against #4 LSU and #6 Purdue would send the Badgers to the Final Four, where they fell to #1 Michigan State, 53 – 41. Despite the disappointing ending, this run would spark the Badger basketball program and propel them into the new century. 

   The next year, Dick Bennett retired three games into the season, claiming he “simply was drained.” He was replaced by Brad Soderberg, an assistant coach, who would help get us to the tournament once again. However, after the season, Soderberg was let go and the University of Wisconsin made the best move of its history and hired Bo Ryan. 

*Bo Knows*

   For those unaware, Bo Ryan was coaching at UW – Milwaukee at the time, but had also coached UW – Platteville, a D III school in southern Wisconsin. While at UW – Platteville, Ryan won the D III championship 4 times. As head coach, Bo Ryan kept the energy from the recent success and turned it into consistent success, something that hadn’t been seen in the modern era of college basketball. Bo Ryan has had 20 win seasons all but once, and has never failed to fall outside of the top 4 of the Big Ten, despite the depth of the conference. He has also never missed the NCAA tournament, and his tenure has seen 4 Sweet Sixteens and 1 Elite Eight appearance. 
Aside from his success in reaching the tournament, Bo Ryan also led the Badgers to back to back Big Ten regular season championships in his first two years and would win the Big Ten tournament in his third year. Behind key players such as Devin Harris, Alando Tucker, Jon Leuer, and many more, Bo Ryan’s time here has been nothing short of amazing and despite the lack of tournament success he has left a positive mark on Wisconsin basketball and will continue to do so. 



**2012 – 2013 Season**


   Last season started out a bit rocky. Losing returning PG Josh Gasser in the off season left us with only Ben Brust at the guard position with any experience, and he was mainly a point boost off the bench. Even with three seniors leading our team, the non-conference schedule was very tough for the Badgers. Losses at Florida, vs. Creighton, at Marquette, and most surprisingly, at home against Virginia (Bo Ryan’s first loss to an unranked team at home) were all hard on the team and added extra concern about the conference schedule, as the Big Ten schedule appeared to be a deadly gauntlet. 
   
   However, the Badgers would start the conference schedule strong, winning their first four, including wins against #12 Illinois and at #2 Indiana. A tough stretch would bring the Badgers into a home matchup against #3 Michigan, where [Ben Brust](http://cdn.gifbay.com/2013/02/incredible_half_court_shot_by_wisconsins_ben_brust_to_force_ot_vs_michigan-32126.gif) would save us and give us a solid win and some momentum to end the season. 

   Unfortunately, all momentum was crushed when the Badgers headed to the Breslin Center to face #10 Michigan State. Coming off a surprising loss at home to Purdue on Senior Night, the Badgers hoped to get going early against MSU. Sadly, offensive inconsistency, which had plagued the Badgers all season, was on display for the whole country to see, as the Badgers lost 58-43, a score that makes it seem closer than it actually was. A win against Penn State kind of made up for those losses and was a hopeful sign of getting ready for the conference tournament. 
The Badgers were the #4 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, securing a first round bye, and setting up a game against Michigan, the #5 seed. The Badgers would win after an ugly first half by scoring 51 points in the second half. Their next game would be against #1 Indiana, where the Badgers would win as well, securing their 12th victory against Indiana in a row. However, the title was not meant to be, as #2 Ohio State would beat them in the final game. 

The promising season that had several bright moments and full of hope would then end in a thud in the big dance. 12 seed Ole Miss would win 57-46 against the 5 seed Badgers in another performance plagued by cold streaks on offense. 

*The Future*

Despite losing 3 starters, the Badgers future looks bright. Point guard is now set, with Brust and Gasser with the experience, but Traevon Jackson and George Marshall contributing in big ways and growing throughout the season. Bronson Koenig, a big time recruit from Milwaukee, may also have the chance to contribute at the point guard position. Sam Dekker also emerged as a stud and will have many opportunities to be a team leader as he gains a starting spot on the roster, hoping to replace the production that Mike Breuesewitz and Ryan Evans had. Frank Kaminsky will also hope to fill the role of Jared Berggren’s role of the big man down under the basket.


 
**Style**

With the hiring of Bo Ryan, Badger basketball underwent a major transition as Bo Ryan introduced his methodical approach to the game. Showing that he can coach with the best of them, Badger basketball has focused on stifling team defense and the swing offense. Many people claim this style to be “boring and slow,” but its beauty lies in how well it works at frustrating opponents. 

On offense, the ball is worked around the perimeter while players on the other side make specific cuts to try to get open shots or easy lay ups. Often, Badger players will not take the first shot, but will wait until there is a good shot. This causes them to use up the shot clock in a way few other teams do consistently, but is helpful in tiring the opponents out by playing long sets on defense. 

The Badger’s defensive game is all about helping out and a focus on teamwork. There are very rarely flashy blocks or high energy steals, but double teams into a bad pass can be just as effective. The defense has always been the strength of Bo Ryan’s teams, as seen by our low possession, low scoring games.

&gt;Not many connections here, but I have one from watching the Kansas-UNC game at the Upper Deck Sports Bar in Hallandale. A Kansas graduate and fan was there to watch the game. Some friends and I were going to take in the whole slate. The Upper Deck kept mangling the TV situation and the Kansas guy was starting to lose it. I put myself in his shoes and went to action. If Miami had been playing, I would have been more than a little aggravated. I got the manager to straighten it out and told the guy (when Kansas was down at the half) that if they got the ball down to Jeff Withey it would open up the perimeter game and Kansas would cruise to the Sweet Sixteen. That happened and he left happy. Five minutes later our waitress came over and told us that he had paid for our dinners and various pints of beer. Thanks Kansas fan, wherever you are!

Arena: Comcast Center (17,950)  
Arena Location: College Park, Md  
The Terps opened play in Comcast Center in October 2002, six months after their national championship win. Comcast Center replaced the historic Cole Field House, Maryland’s home court for nearly 50 years. Built into the side of a hill on the eastern fringes of campus, the majority of student seating is in a 4,000 seat section behind one of the baskets known simply as “The Wall.” That section gets filled with signs and big heads during the second half, when the opponents shoot at the basket in front of it. 

Students also are permitted to sit along both sidelines in court-level seating and in a small section behind the other basket. It is generally regarded as one of the toughest places to play in college basketball, although attendance dropped significantly during the school’s lean years in the mid- to late-2000s.

Conference Championships: 4 (1931, 1958, 1984, 2004)    
National Titles: 1 (2002)

**2012-13 Season**  

**[Record: 25-13 \(8-10 ACC\)](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/schedule/MD/maryland-terrapins)**  
**[Roster](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/roster/MD/maryland-terrapins)**  
Head Coach: Mark Turgeon, 2nd season  
Assistant Coaches: Bino Ranson (3rd season), Dalonte Hill (2nd season), Scott Spinelli (2nd season)  

**Key Players**  
**[Alex Len, C:](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/57379/alex-len)**  
Len entered his sophomore year at Maryland as a projected lottery pick, with some mock drafts predicting the 7-1 Ukranian to be a darkhorse candidate to be the first overall pick. What followed was a sometimes brilliant, primarily maddeningly inconsistent season that didn’t undermine his lottery status (going fifth to the Phoenix Suns in last week’s draft), but fostered questions about his ability to stick in the NBA long-term.

Little was known about the center before he came to Maryland in 2011; expected to be a prototypical European center (early scouting reports talked more of his jump-shooting ability, likely because it was the only available video of him at the time), Len bulked up (eating at Boston Market virtually every day-not a joke) and worked on his inside game before the 2012 season.

Len played his biggest game of the season in Maryland’s first game of the season, a nationally-televised matchup against third-ranked Kentucky in Brooklyn. Len scored 23 points and collected 12 rebounds in Maryland’s 72-69 loss to the Wildcats, easily outplaying expected first-overall pick Nerlens Noel.

Unfortunately, Len struggled to live up to those big expectations set from those games through the season. He struggled against teams without true centers in conference play, notably in an ugly loss to Boston College in February. He didn’t put up especially gaudy statistics either, averaging 11.9 points and 7.8 rebounds for the Terps. 

Part of the reason for that inconsistent play may have been a stress fracture he suffered in his left ankle at some point during the season. Len said in an interview with Grantland last week that he played “half the season” with the injury, not realizing it was more than an ankle sprain until an end-of-season MRI.

Still, he had his moments for Maryland this season. A last-second tip-in by Len against 14th-ranked N.C. State gave Maryland its first ranked win since March 2010 and its first in 18 tries. He scored 19 points and pulled down nine rebounds in Maryland’s win over second-ranked Duke in February. In the ACC Tournament semifinals against North Carolina, Len scored 20 points-his first 20-point outing since the Kentucky game-in Maryland’s three-point loss to the Tar Heels.

**[Dezmine “Dez” Wells, SG:](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/56144/dez-wells)**  
Wells went from out of college basketball to College Park to Maryland’s best player all in the span of a few short months. Kicked out of Xavier over a sexual assault allegation in August, a jury chose not to charge the guard with a crime, but Xavier’s athletic department refused to reverse their decision. A short recruiting period later, Wells chose Maryland, and was declared eligible for the 2012-13 season in November.

Wells quickly became Maryland’s most important player, averaging a team-high 13.1 points per game. The 6’5 guard played all three guard positions for the Terps, averaging 4.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists, which also led the team.
After getting off to an ugly start to the season against Kentucky, Wells quickly righted the ship, scoring 23 and 25 points in non-conference wins over Northwestern and George Mason. In the ACC Tournament, Wells’ career-high 30 points helped Maryland beat Duke for the second time this season. With Alex Len gone, Wells will return to College Park as Maryland’s most talented player in the 2013-14 season.

**[Nick Faust, SG:](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/57378/nick-faust)**  
Much like Wells, Nick Faust served as a do-everything type player for the guard-limited Terps this season. Faust played all three guard positions for the Terps, including a stint late in the season at starting point guard in the place of the weak-shooting Pe’Shon Howard. Although his stat line wasn’t gaudy--9.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.5 assists--it’s a sign of the versatility that Maryland so desperately needed in its lineup this year. 

Faust’s best game came against Clemson, when he scored 18 points to lead Maryland, despite the Tigers’ attempts to get back into the game. In addition, Faust was key in Maryland’s near-upset of North Carolina, scoring 17 points in the loss. He also came up big in Maryland’s NIT run, tallying 15 points and 11 rebounds in the opener against Niagara. He was the primary reason why Maryland was able to keep their semifinal matchup with Iowa close, scoring 14 points in the season-ending loss. 

Honorable Mention: Seth Allen, Jake Layman, Charles Mitchell

**Biggest Moments**  

**[Topping #14 N.C. State 51-50: January 16, 2013](http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330160120)**  
Maryland opened the game against the Wolfpack on a 10-0 run and held N.C. State to just 16 first-half points, their lowest total in five years. Maryland led for the first 36 minutes of the game before Scott Wood’s three-pointer gave the Wolfpack their first lead. Alex Len scored the Terps’ last six points, including the game winning putback on a Pe’Shon Howard airball with less than a second left to give Maryland its first ranked win in 18 tries--dating back to their win over third-ranked Duke in March 2010.

**[Maryland Beats Duke, Round 1: February 16, 2013](http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330470120)**  
Despite playing one of their sloppiest games of the year (Maryland turned the ball over 26 times in the game), Maryland used a dominant performance from Alex Len and two key free throws from Seth Allen to narrowly beat Duke 83-81 in College Park. Len finished the game with 19 points and nine rebounds, but more importantly held Mason Plumlee--who had scored 19 points in Duke’s home win over Maryland--to just four points and three rebounds. Allen scored 16 points for Maryland in the win, but his two free throws with 2.8 seconds left were the most important points he scored, icing the game for the Terps.

**[Maryland Beats Duke, Round 2: March 15, 2013](http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330740150)**  
Maryland entered the ACC Tournament knowing it needed to win the tournament or at least make the final to have any hope of making the NCAA Tournament after an ugly stretch after their first win over Duke derailed their chances. After beating Wake Forest in the first round, Maryland put together one of their most complete performances of the season against Duke in the quarterfinals, topping Duke 83-74 to hand the Blue Devils their first loss of the season with Ryan Kelly in the lineup. Dez Wells scored a career-high 30 points, while four other Terrapins pitched in 10 points apiece. Maryland led the entire game, and Duke shot just 4-of-25 from behind the three-point line in the loss--their worst performance of the season. Maryland would lose to North Carolina narrowly in the ACC semifinals, ending their tournament chances. Maryland became the first team since the 2005 Terrapins to beat Duke twice and miss the NCAA Tournament.

Honorable Mention: vs. Kentucky (loss), vs. North Carolina (loss), vs. Denver (win), at Alabama (win)

**2013-14 Season**  
[Roster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Maryland_Terrapins_men%27s_basketball_team#Roster)  
New Recruits: [Damonte Dodd](http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/152049/damonte-dodd), [Roddy Peters](http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/165587/roddy-peters)  

**[Schedule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Maryland_Terrapins_men%27s_basketball_team#Schedule_and_Results)**   
While the full schedule hasn’t been set yet, Maryland’s non-conference schedule includes a matchup with Connecticut in the Barclays Center, a home game against Oregon State, and a road game against Ohio State in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Terps will also participate in the Paradise Jam Tournament in the Virgin Islands and will play in the BB&amp;T Classic against George Washington despite rumors that Maryland would walk away from the event.

Maryland’s ACC opponents in their final season in the conference include home games against conference champion Miami and new conference members Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, and Syracuse. The Terps have road dates with Duke, UNC, and N.C. State, but none of those teams will make return trips to College Park--a supposed slight against Maryland for leaving the conference.

**The Greats**  

**Greatest Games**  

**1974 ACC Tournament Final vs. NC State**  
Although the Terps lost to NC State 103-100 in overtime (to a Wolfpack team that eventually won the national championship), this game is widely regarded as one of the greatest games of all time. At the time, only conference champions made the NCAA Tournament, so this game was instrumental in expanding the tournament to include at-large teams. The 1974 team is considered to be the best team to not make the tournament, as Maryland boasted six future draft picks, including first-rounders John Lucas, Len Elmore, and Tom McMillen.

**[1986 vs. North Carolina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KdFhvX8Xaw)**  
Behind 36 points from Len Bias, the Terps upset the top-ranked Tar Heels 77-72, handing North Carolina their first loss in the Dean Smith Center. Bias’s most memorable moment came late in the second half, when he stole an inbounds pass and finished with a reverse slam dunk, one of the lasting images of his short life.

**[2002 vs. Duke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2UUyAzKLMg)**  
Playing their final game in Cole Field House against Duke, the third-ranked Terps topped first-ranked Duke 87-73. The game is best known for Billy Packer’s “Oh He Steal!” call just before the end of the first half, when Steve Blake stole the ball from Jay Williams near midcourt.

**2002 NCAA Tournament Final vs. Indiana**  
Maryland won their first NCAA championship behind 18 points from Juan Dixon. Down 44-42 with 9:52 remaining, the Terps ended the game on a 22-8 run to top Indiana. Lonny Baxter finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds, one of four players from the team that would go on to be drafted: Baxter, Dixon, Steve Blake, and Chris Wilcox. Head coach Gary Williams became the first alumnus to coach his school to the national title since Norm Sloan at North Carolina State in 1974.

**[2003 NCAA Tournament First Round vs. UNC-Wilmington](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=EAMNgPo5-gc#t=104s)**  
In danger of losing in the first round a year after winning the national championship, Drew Nicholas nailed a three pointer at the buzzer to top the Seahawks 75-73.

**[2010 vs. Georgia Tech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD0S6wR6K9Y)**  
In one of the weirdest finishes ever (and one I witnessed), Maryland had to sink two buzzer beaters to top the Yellow Jackets after the first was nullified by a timeout. Greivis Vasquez hit a running shot from just inside the half court line, but it was waved off because head coach Gary Williams called timeout. After the timeout, Cliff Tucker hit a three pointer over Glen Rice Jr. to beat a Yellow Jackets team boasting Derrick Favors and Iman Shumpert.

**Greatest Players**  
Len Elmore: Maryland’s all-time leading rebounder, a three-time All-ACC selection, and a 1974 All-American. Elmore was selected as one of the ACC’s 50 Greatest Players for their 50th anniversary team. Elmore was selected 13th in the 1974 NBA Draft.

John Lucas: Lucas was a two-time All-American, the 1976 ACC Male Athlete of the Year, and the first overall pick in the 1976 draft. Lucas was also selected to the ACC 50th anniversary team.

Len Bias: A two-time All-American, a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and the 1986 ACC Male Athlete of the Year. Bias was selected to the ACC 50th anniversary team and was the second pick of the 1986 NBA Draft, less than 48 hours before he died of a cocaine overdose.

Juan Dixon: Dixon was the 2002 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, an All-American, and the 2002 ACC Male Athlete of the Year. Dixon was the 17th overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. He was also selected for the ACC 50th anniversary team.

**Why:** Because it's the off season.

**Where:** You can vote [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JKDgRI8nzOJEZsxlXF-CZtPYdvd3H1dcDkV3yJAXch4/viewform). You can see the full bracket [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AirJNpGeqx8ndEt6SWJoWnhWdEU3a3czYi1JS1NkRlE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html).

**When:** Voting will remain open until May 15th at 12:00pm Central.

**Other FAQs**

- *Your seeding sucks.*

No, you suck. Also, that's not a question.

- *Why isn't my favorite GIF included?*

Only GIFs that met the following criteria were considered:

- The event took place during the 2012-2013 NCAA basketball season. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/Ohp6m)? Ineligible because it happened last year.
- The event is more than just a SportsCenter highlight play. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/zCfFU)? Ineligible because it's just a top play.
- The GIF isn't heavily edited. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/J2AFB)? Ineligible because it's more about the author's creativity than the actual moment.

It's also possible that we missed something. In that case, enjoy the GIF NIT, losers.

- *Can I vote more than once?*

We don't care. If winning a GIF Tournament is a big enough deal for you that you try to stuff the ballot box, by all means, go ahead and stuff. Just realize that when people say they hate your team because they hate your fans, they're talking about you.

- *How is the bracket scored?*

We'll take the average score for each GIF. Higher score wins in each matchup. If two GIFs have an identical average score, we'll advance the one with more votes. If two GIFs have an identical average score and an identical number of votes, we'll advance the one with more views (the beauty of Google's URL shortener is that it counts page views for us). If two GIFs have an identical average score and an identical number of votes and an identical number of views, we'll flip a coin.

- *Where'd you find these GIFs?*

Most of them came from user submissions here. Some of them also came from websites that like to post a lot of GIFs. These include, but aren't limited to [Barstool Sports](http://www.barstoolsports.com/), [BigLeadSports](http://www.thebiglead.com/), [Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com/), [College Hoops Journal](http://www.collegehoopsjournal.com/), and [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/).

- *Who won the actual March Madness pool?*

Gah...we know. We're lame. And late. Tallying some of the more unique prize categories has been more difficult and time consuming than we expected. We'll have an announcement and distribute prizes shortly."	t5_2rj3j	True

Make sure you view it in incognito mode so you're not stuck with a 4-hour preview. If you have a cable account and log on, they let you see games on what channels you have in your cable package. For example, if you logon with your account and you don't have TruTV, you won't be able to see this game.
Games that are broadcast on CBS do not affect your 4-hour preview

TL;DR: Don't bother logging in with your cable account, just open it in an incognito window so you don't have to worry about the preview time or if you will be able to stream a game.

[Bob Huggins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Huggins#Cincinnati) - Coached UC during the second “golden era”, from 1989 to 2005. He got forced out after some horrible academic years and some DUIs. Many UC fans wish he were still here.

**Greatest Rivalries:** 

[Xavier, The Crosstown Shootout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstown_Classic_(basketball) - First met in 1927. After the brawl that occurred at the end of the 2011 game, they changed the name to the “Crosstown Classic”, to eliminate the violent connotations with the game. Most fans still call it “The Shootout”. They also moved it to the neutral US Bank Arena, after the on-campus crowds were deemed to be a cause of on-court violence.

Unlike many college rivalries, there is absolutely zero respect between the two fan bases, and there never has been. The two campuses are separated by roughly 2 miles. To say this is a rivalry based on proximity would be a vast understatement.

The Bearcats own the all-time series at 49 wins and 31 losses, although Xavier has faired well over the last 15 years.

* [School songs](http://www.gobearcats.com/genrel/081806aac.html)
* Expired editions of the student newspaper are ripped into confetti by the student section and tossed into the air after the Bearcats’ basket of the game.
* Down The Drive – A cheer we do during timeouts, but it’s done all over campus, even in a non-athletic settings. There isn’t a good YouTube video of it, but [this video of a football game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DYLz3-Cjuo) should give you the basic idea. It’s kinda cheesy, but when you have 13,000+ in a packed arena doing it, it really does sound cool.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Heading into the 2012-13 season, my expectations were relatively low. In 2011-12, we made an impressive run to the Sweet 16, but lost 2 important seniors. I was pretty surprised when we were able to bolt out of the gate in ‘12-‘13 and climb all the way to #8 in the nation.

However, eventually our defense-first mentality caught up with us. When I say defense-first, I mean **only defense**. We didn’t play much offense all year. I’m gonna blow my top just talking about it. On defense we were complicated and crippling. We had the potential to absolutely suffocate an opponent. On offense, it was streetball. If you’ve ever played basketball in your driveway, you’ve used our 2012-13 offensive system. For the love of god, it was horrible to watch. I truly believe we could’ve repeated our Sweet 16 run if we had a shred of an offensive gameplan. That has to be the #1 priority for Coach Mick Cronin headed into next season.

Looking ahead to the 2013-14 season, I think we have the potential to be an extremely exciting team. You could call us “Sean Kilpatrick &amp; Friends”. One of the greatest players in program history is coming back for his senior year, and he’ll be joined by 5 intriguing freshmen, including 5* PF Jermaine Lawrence. I expect Kilpatrick to average somewhere between 18-23 points, with some of the freshmen getting some serious minutes. It’ll be fun to watch.

Given all the new meat, and some question marks and point guard, it’s hard to say where we’ll end up next season. Our schedule will be easier than recent years, given the switch to the AAC. Most experts have us as a fringe tourney team, and I think that’s pretty fair. I think it’s safe to say we’ll make the tournament, but we could fare much better or much worse, depending on how the freshmen play.

* Last season, the teams split the season series, with the home team winning by 15 each game.

* Indiana and Michigan State are two of the three remaining Big Ten teams with only one conference loss (Michigan is the third).  Pending Michigan's game against Illinois later today, the winner of this game might find themselves alone atop the Big Ten.

* The Hoosiers are 1-5 against Michigan State over the past four years, with their only win coming off of their previous meeting."	t5_2rj3j	True

With the season nearly upon us we are ready to start selecting the voter pool for our user poll. Would you like to apply? Send an email to our gmail address: reddit.collegebasketball@gmail.com

In this email you need to provide the following:

* Your reddit screenname
* Email address you want us to use (even if it's the same one you emailed from, please type it out)
* Your favorite team
* Your least favorite or 'most hated team'
* Whether you will be able to set aside your personal biases when voting, and why.

Right now we are thinking of selecting a pool of around 50-70 voters, but the final number will be wholly dependent on the amount and diversity of those applications we receive.

We will be accepting applications until October 19th. Preference for voters that are part of the larger fan-bases will be based on past participation in this subreddit.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ask in this thread or send me a PM.

***

**EDIT 2:** I forgot to mention something! I'm actually still missing scores and opponents for a handful of games that were played in the early '80s. All missing scores were of games against non-Division I opponents. I have not been able to track down complete schedules for the following schools/seasons:

* Baltimore, 1979-80
* Grambling State, 1979-80
* Jackson State, 1981-82
* US International, 1981-82 and 1983-84

Just yesterday, I managed to track down one of the scores I was missing, the second leg of a home-and-home between Southern and Tuskegee during the 1986-87 season. The schedules above have been stubbornly eluding me for years, though. The [NCAA's online statistics archive](http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch) doesn't have records for any of the above schools/seasons, and they don't have *any* records at all for Baltimore or USIU. LexisNexis hasn't turned up those records, either. I've called the SID offices at both Grambling and Jackson State, but neither of them ever called me back. I have *Street and Smith* annuals for almost every year going back to 1981-82, but that one doesn't include the JSU or USIU schedules (both had just moved up to Division I), and I'm missing the 1979-80 and 1983-84 editions.

If any of you fine folks can fill in those gaps, I'd be ever so grateful.

***

**EDIT 3:** Corrected a minor error in the bottom 25.

***

About two months ago, I posted this over on /r/CFB:

http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/17y5ft/40_years_of_college_football_cfb_program_rankings/

Several people asked if I'd done something similar with basketball. I wasn't quite done with my basketball data at that time, but now I am, so here it is!

**Just to be clear, this is my own independent ranking algorithm. I didn't make use of any external polls or ranking systems.**

So this here is a 40-year overall program ranking. For every program, I totaled up their seasons and averaged their rankings, then sorted everyone by average ranking. A total of 362 teams were ranked. This includes teams that once had a Division I basketball program but either no longer play at the top level or have canceled athletics entirely.

Some interesting notes:

* The highest ranked team with a losing overall record is Washington State.
* The lowest ranked team with a winning overall record is South Dakota. They have only been Division I for five seasons, so this position may be a bit deceptive. The lowest ranked team with an appreciable number of seasons at the Division I level (29) with a winning overall record is Radford.
* The highest ranked team that no longer plays Division I basketball is Birmingham Southern, at #127. The Panthers currently play in the Southern Athletic Association at the Division III level.
* The most recent school to drop its entire athletics program is Morris Brown, which canceled all intercollegiate competition after the 2002-03 season. Other schools to drop varsity athletics include Northeastern Illinois (1997-98), US International (1990-91), and Baltimore (1982-83).
* The lowest ranked team that has been Division I for all 40 years under consideration is New Hampshire, at #336.

This list includes the top 100 and the bottom 25 only. If the ""seasons"" column is blank, then the team was Division I all 40 years.

*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:** Everyone knows or should know about our [recent ncaa runs](http://www.butlersports.com/final-4-recap), but here are some other important Butler games.
[Butler-IU, Dec 15, 2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHux93HsEA&amp;t=0m52s) [Butler-Florida, March 26, 2011](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/gameflash/2011/03/26/70992_recap.html) Butler fans know that Florida has always been our NCAA giant, beating us in the first round in 2000, and in the Sweet 16 in 2007(on their way to their 2nd national championship).  That made coming back to win this game that much sweeter.  Of course, Butler has nothing for respect for Florida, as the Stevens, shaking hands with Donovan after the game, told him that “you out-coached me”.

**Greatest Players:** [Gordon Hayward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward)
[Shelvin Mack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelvin_Mack)
[Bobby Plump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Plump)
**Greatest Coaches:** [Tony Hinkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinkle) The namesake of “Hinkle Fieldhouse, Tony coached both Football and Basketball at Butler.  But everyone knows him as the man who made basketballs orange.
[Brad Stevens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens) As sad as we are to see him go, everyone wishes him the best of luck in Boston.
**Greatest Rivalries:** 
Butler-Xavier, of which Xavier leads the series 31-17.  This stems from the fact that Xavier got their start in the Midwest League that turned into the Horizon League, before moving onto greener pastures and into a bigger crosstown rivalry with Cinci, however, this match up has heated up recently with Butler’s recent developments, and ESPECIALLY with [this clock mishap buzzer beater on Dec 19, 2009](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VeanV6lA-M)

*Traditions*

Butler Students don’t have many traditions, with the exception of “tour de fountain”, as in swimming in all 3 [fountains](http://www.offenburger.com/images/CampusFountainRunsBlue.jpg), including the one in the library.

*Random Trivia*
***
Smallest campus/student population to make the championship game since expanding to 32 teams. 
***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
This is going to be an interesting year for Butler.  It’s our first year in the new Big East, Brad Stevens just left us, and Rotnei Clarke and Andrew Smith are gone.  With 6 freshmen coming in (4 scholarship, 2 walk ons), it’s going to be a young team with a young new coach.  As much as I’d like to tell you Butler will be fine and keep making it into the NCAA, I can’t honestly say that.  But I can say I have faith in Barry picking Brandon Miller, as he was the man to pick Brad to replace Todd Licklitter.  I’m hoping for a &gt;.500% season in the new BE, and a trip to the NCAA at least.

****

**Greatest Games:**

[Home win over UNLV in an overly packed Pit in ‘77-’78.](http://www.wolf-bytes.com/index_files/Calender/AR00.htm)- The article is pretty long and a little homer, but it was a big deal at the time because of how good both teams were, and the fact that the game was almost shut down for being 2,000 people over capacity.

[Unranked win over #1 Arizona in ‘88.](http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-03/sports/sp-32397_1_arizona-mexico-game)

[Unranked win over #3 BYU](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=310610252)- The Lobos were not expected to win this game, and with losing a key player on the BYU bench, the Lobos got to prop themselves up for the next few years to come.

   

**Greatest Players:**

[Danny Granger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Granger)

[Michael Cooper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cooper)

[Kenny Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Thomas_%28basketball%29)

[Luc Longley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Longley)

[**Greatest Coaches:**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Lobos_men's_basketball#Coaching_records)

Bob King (1962-72): The reason The Pit was built 37 years ago and the reason Lobo basketball has its unbelievable following is because of this man...from 1900-62, the Lobos posted a record of 418-485 with zero postseason appearances...since that time, New Mexico has won more than 63 percent of its games and qualified for postseason play 26 times...in the eight years prior to Bob King’s arrival, the Lobos never won more than seven games in a season...since that time, UNM has only had three losing seasons in the past 40 years...Lobomania was set in motion by Bob King and his early teams that played in Johnson Gym...their success created the need for a bigger arena, which came to life for the first time on Dec. 1, 1966...26 years later, the floor was appropriately named Bob King Court for the man who got it all started for New Mexico basketball. Record: 175-89

Norm Ellenberger (1972-79): Arguably the most controversial coach in Lobo Basketball, Ellenburger continued the success of Bob King but was later forced to resign after “Lobogate”, a lurid episode involving forged academic transcripts, payments made for bogus junior-college credits to keep players eligible, and other devices permitting individuals entirely lacking academic credentials to be represented as college students while playing on Ellenberger's team. The episode began with an FBI wiretap on the phone of a prominent Lobo booster, recording a conversation in which Ellenberger arranged with assistant coach Manny Goldstein to transfer bogus credits from a California junior college to the office of the UNM registrar. Subsequent investigation turned up a manufactured college seal from Mercer County Community College in New Jersey, along with blank transcripts and an extensive record of previous forgery, and was found a few years later with 57 rule violations, and Ellenberger himself was convicted on 21 counts of fraud. Record: 134-62

Dave Bliss (1988-99): Dave Bliss brought the Lobos back to a solid program. He took the team to the NCAA tournament six of his last seven seasons, reaching the second round in the last four years. The Lobos were ranked among the AP Top 25 team almost every week during Kenny Thomas' four-season career, cracking the Top 10 seven times, and the team reached the NCAA tournament all four seasons. Record: 246-108

Steve Alford (2007-13): Alford began his coaching career with the Lobos with the best season they’d seen since Dave Bliss, and carried on to be the winning-est Lobo coach currently seen. He left New Mexico to coach UCLA in 2013. Record: 155-52

**Greatest Rivalries:** The Rio Grande Rivalry- A series between The University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University that encompasses sports for both programs. The Rio Grande Rivalry officially started and was recognized beginning in the 2007-08 academic year. It is a rivalry unmatched by few and it dates back to the early days. The first competition began with football on January 1, 1894, which was the Lobos' first competition against another four-year institution. The first basketball game was played on December 22, 1904. The rivalry between the two schools began before the territory of New Mexico became a state in 1912.

One who’s a fan also can’t go without mentioning the growing rivalry happening with UNM-UNLV and UNM-SDSU, who have traded games and battled for the last few years to sit atop the throne. Moving forward, this looks to be just the beginning of great games to come.

****

*Traditions*

****

* Newspaper Shake: While opposing teams are announced, the student section opens up a newspaper and pretends to read, shaking it and yelling “Who’s that?” after each name announced for the opposing starting line-up.

* Stand and Cheer: At the start of each half, all fans rise and cheer and clap until both teams have scored.

* Section 26: Where the students are seated. Section 26 members receive a howl sheet before each game with opposing teams rosters, stats, and embarrassing information as well as information about upcoming games. Arguably one of the most intimidating sections in college basketball.

*Random Trivia*

***

* [Notable Alumni can be found here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_New_Mexico_alumni)

* Sports Illustrated rated The Pit 13 in Top 20 Sports Venues of the 20th Century. [Link](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/06/02/top_venues/)

* During the 2010-2011 season, The Lobos ranked 16th in attendance.

* Although Albuquerque is near a mile high in elevation, The Pit descends from ground level to the bottom of the arena. It was built roof first, and architecturally, the roof is essentially what holds up the building. The ceiling is also low, which helps to encase the sound and make it feel as if the crowd is doubled.

***

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

The 2012-2013 season was a very interesting ride for Lobo fans to say the least. Towards the beginning of the year, there were doubts that The Lobos would be still present on the inside after losing Drew Gordon and AJ Hardeman. There was also doubts that a true leader would step up in big games, as that leader was Drew Gordon. The  Sophomore Alex Kirk stepped up to fill the role of rebounder, and names like Kendall Williams and Tony Snell stepped up in pivotal moments in order to give the Lobos a winning season. Cameron Bairstow also stepped up to create a new High-Low game that the Lobos hadn’t had previously. They ended the regular season with a 26-5 record, and cruised to win the Mountain West Tournament. The Lobos ended up in the NCAA Tournament with a 3 seed, with many debating if that was too low or too high, and busted many brackets when they lost to Harvard in the second round.

Looking forward to the 2013-2014 season, with the losses of Jamal Fenton, who provided spark off the bench, Chad Adams who rotated with the big men, and Tony Snell, who left for the NBA, the Lobos will once again need a player to step up and play a “star” type of role. Also, the Lobos will face a change in their coaching, as Steve Alford transferred to UCLA, and with Craig “Noodles” Neal taking the reins. Under Alford, Noodles ran the offense, so there shouldn’t be any expected drops or changes in how the offense runs the game. Aside from that, fans expect to continue their winning ways and look to go further in the tournament with the return of 4 of the 5 starters. The non-conference schedule looks to be much tougher previous years, which says a lot considering the Lobos SOS was ranked [number 2](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/rankings/rpi/index1) last year, which will toughen the team early on. Good things should be expected, but as history has shown, UNM struggles often in the NCAA tournament. Their motto already going into the season is “Unfinished Business”. Will this be the year that The Lobos advance to the Sweet 16 or beyond?

Also notable as of current, is that both Alex Kirk and Kendall Williams were asked to try out for the USA for the World University games, with Alex Kirk still in the running for that. Cameron Bairstow is currently going to be playing for the Australian team in that same series. And, finally, Tony Snell was selected 20th overall to play for the Chicago Bulls. To say that lots are expected here after these events would be an understatement.

*Random Tidbits*

***

* Anyone who watches UNM basketball, be it in person or on the television will always recognize one person. This guy’s name is [Snake](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000dmoXGh_LWJ0/s/600/600/ADPhoto-BYU-UNM-027.jpg). Snake is a guy that was once a ball boy during the Bob King/Ellenberger era, and has continued his fandom well into today. He’s constantly on the floor of the student section, talking [trash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osk2TxExNL4), getting people pumped, and always in support of the team. He even shows up early to greet opposing players as they get off the bus, and goes to away games to continue the support.

* The Lobo fan base travels fairly well. While we may not be in mass to places far away during the regular season, it’s not uncommon to have a good portion of the Mountain West Tournament filled with Lobos fans, so much so that the Thomas and Mack center which is home of the UNLV Rebels has even earned the nickname “Pit West”. Fans also fly out to support the team in the big dance. Any close game that’s a drive away, and fans are there.

* Some more memorable moments in Lobo history, as well as key players in Lobo history can be found [here](http://www.golobos.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/030103aaa.html).

**KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY**

*Proud members of the Big 12 Conference*

**Year Founded:** 1863. Kansas State is celebrating it's sesquicentennial this year.

**Location:** Manhattan, Kansas AKA The Little Apple

**Current Enrollment:** 24,378 students (19,385 undergraduates, and 3,885 postgraduates)


**Mascot:** [Willie the Wildcat.](http://fantanistazone.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Willie-the-Wildcat.jpg) 

Willie will dress for whatever sporting event he is at, and will generally default to the football uniform when he is at pep rallies or other univeristy events. For example, here he is at a [basketball game](http://pictures.replayphotos.com/images/KSU/smd/kansas-state-university-football-automatically-imported-lasalle-v-kansas-state-ksu-f-auto-00126smd.jpg), and a [baseball game](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/WillietheWildcat002.JPG). He has also been known to break out a tuxedo on special occasions. 

Willie's identity is traditionally kept secret.

Some older pictures of Willie: [1](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/images/babyjay_resize.jpg) [2](http://www.k-state.edu/images/home/gallery/willie.jpg)

**Cheerleaders** [1](http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/ksu/graphics/cheer/team-pregame.jpg) [2](http://chivethebrigade.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ksu-girls-500-49.jpg)

**[Fight Song:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuhM0QcR_-M)** Composed in 1927, *Wildcat Victory* is Kansas State University's fight song. 

Go fight, you K-State Wildcats,    
For Alma Mater fight (Fight! Fight! Fight!)    
Glory in the combat    
For the purple and the white,    
Faithful to our colors,    
We shall ever be,    
Fighting, ever fighting for a Wildcat Victory!    
Go State!    

**Arena:** 

The Basketball team currently plays in the Octagon of Doom, Bramlage Coliseum. The stadium earned the nickname because it is shaped like an octagon. Bramlage was constructed in 1989.

[Bird's Eye](http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/north_america/united_states/kansas/manhattan_bramlage1.jpg)

From 1950 until 1989, the Wildcats played in Ahearn Fieldhouse, one of the country's first arenas specifically built for basketball, and one of the largest in the country. Ahearn's monstrous home court advantage helped the Wildcats earn a 369-96 (.793) record there. Ahearn is still standing today, and is used for Volleyball games, indoor Track and Field meets, and various university functions.

**[Wabash Cannonball:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWiNSw7o1c)** On December 13, 1968, [an arsonist set fire to Nichols Hall](http://www.cis.ksu.edu/system/files/nichols_fire_4.jpg), which at the time was the home of the Music Department. Every piece of music in the band's library was lost, except for an arrangement of Wabash Cannonball which the band director had brought home that night to work on. The band played it at a basketball game three days later, and the song quickly became very popular. It would go on to become K-State's second, unofficial fight song. When played, fans will rock their bodies back and forth, alternating with the people around them. [This looks really cool when large groups of people do it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUjQ39eTQbk). It is a bit of a workout.

**[Alma Mater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvNJRoPQKSQ#t=5m40s)**

(The timestamp I put in here doesn't seem to be working. Skip to 5:40 for the Alma Mater)

The alma mater, selected in a campus contest in 1903, was written by Humphrey W. Jones, who graduated from KSU in the class of 1888. Whenever the Alma Mater is performed by the band, students and alumni will sway back and forth, arms wrapped around each other's shoulders, and sing along. Win or lose, the band will play this at the end of every football and basketball game.

I know a spot that I love full well,    
'Tis not in forest, nor yet in dell;    
Ever it holds me with magic spell,    
I think of thee, Alma Mater.    
K-S-U, we'll carry thy banner high.    
K-S-U, long, long may thy colors fly.    
Loyal to thee, thy children will swell the cry.    
Hail, hail, hail, Alma Mater.    

Fun Fact: Our Alma Mater was written when we were the Kansas State Agricultural College, so the lyrics used to read:

K-S-A-C, carry thy banner high,    
K-S-A-C, long may thy colors fly.

**[K-S-U Chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChcvGzi_ScM)**

Willie the Wildcat will lead the crowd in the K-S-U chant before each game, during timeouts when the basketball team is doing really well, and at various school functions. 

**Starting lineup**

Students will rustle newspapers when the opposing team's starting lineup is introduced. After each name is read off, the students will yell: Big Deal, Who Cares, Who's He, So What, and Go Home. They will then tear up the newspapers, and toss them into the air when our team is introduced.

**[Tunnel Dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM_eL0qK8rQ)**

Before each game, this gets played on the jumbotron right before the team runs out onto the court. This was started by Martavious Irving when he was a freshman four years ago.

**EMAW**

A slogan that stands for Every Man a Wildcat. It symbolizes that one is part of the Wildcat nation, and is fun to yell at games, write on signs, or [spray paint onto billboards](http://www.thewizofodds.com/.a/6a00e553e551d18834011278d6dfbf28a4-500wi).

Recently, there has been some controversy over the phrase. In 2009, an opinion piece was published in the student newspaper that said the phrase should be replaced with EPAW (Every Person a Wildcat), since EMAW is sexist and excludes women. Most students disagree, saying that EMAW is not meant to exclude women, that ""man"" in this context refers to both men and women. Neil Armstrong did not mean to exclude women when he said ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" for example. The University has stopped using EMAW in any official capacity out of a desire to not appear sexist, but it is still very popular with students.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City population:** 52,281 (From the 2010 Census)

**City skyline: [lolwut](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Manhattan_Kansas_Downtown_overhead.jpg)**

**[Aerial View of Campus](http://ksulib.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c533253ef017ee87c0b1b970d-500wi)**

**Iconic Campus Buildings:**

* **[Hale Library](http://www.k-state.edu/maps/buildings/HL/hl.jpg)**: The main library at KSU.

* **[Anderson Hall](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3338/3256060913_0981472db4_o.jpg)**: The administration building at K-State. One of the oldest buildings on campus, having been constructed in 1879. The building today looks a lot like it did in the 1800's. [Anderson Hall, from about where Aggieville is today, in 1885](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3250/3150996587_259f439fcb_b.jpg)

* **[Nichols Hall](http://www.k-state.edu/maps/buildings/N/n.jpg)**: Currently home to the Computer Science and Theatre departments. Nichols used to be a gymnasium, and was the home of K-State Basketball until 1950, when Ahearn Field house was built. The music department was located here in the 60's, and during 1968, [there was a fire there that destroyed most of the band's music](http://www.cis.ksu.edu/system/files/nichols_fire_4.jpg). The only piece of music that survived was an arrangement of Wabash Cannonball, which the band played at a basketball game three days later. The fans loved it, and it became our secondary fight song 

**Local Dining** (Disclaimer: I rarely eat out in Manhattan, as I live in the dorms. Input is welcome here)

There are several great bars and restaurants in [Aggieville](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tb2K7ob45E4/TQnUbEcSF1I/AAAAAAAAouY/hA0EsU3lmyM/s1600/StreetOfAggieville.jpg), which is located near the southeast corner of campus. Among them are:

* So Long Saloon: Has great burgers. So Long Saloon is tiny, and I doubt it could seat more than 20 people at once

* Hunam Express: Some of the best chinese takeout I think I've ever had.

* ~~Doughboy's Pizza: Best pizza I've had in Manhattan.~~ Apparently they've closed...

* Rusty's Last Chance: Country themed bar

* Call Hall: KSU's Animal Sciences and Industry Department sells (very good) ice cream in Call Hall

* Kite's Bar and Grill

* Big D's Burger Shack

* Pizza Shuttle: Pretty good cream cheese pizzas. I'm fairly certain their business model is based mostly on being open late and and being across the street from the Engineering dorms. It's common practice here to do a ""Shuttle Drop,"" where you flip the box upside down and drop it from shoulder height to remove some of the grease from the pizza.

Other local restaurants and bars, copy/pasted from /u/bdysnatchers' comment.

* The Chef: Between The Buenos Dias Frittata (named best breakfast in Kansas), to Pancakes Bananas Fosters, there is no better spot for breakfast west of Kansas City. I'm a big fan of The McGuyver , which are plate sized pancakes with anything you want added to them. They have an incredible atmosphere with awesome music and a huge selection of breakfast cocktails, if you're feeling frisky. Seriously. Go to The Chef.

* Bluestem Bistro: My favorite little coffee shop in the heart of Aggieville. They serve awesome coffee and specialty espresso drinks, and some pretty good sandwiches.

* AJ's Pizza: Way better than Doughboys. They have their location near the mall on Poyntz, but the real draw is their Aggieville location on 11th. Huge slices of pizza with gourmet toppings, only open after 10 on weekends. You'll see everyone you know here after a night out

* Auntie Mae's: As for bars, the world begins and ends at Auntie Mae's. Mae's is the hipster haunt of Manhattan. It's not a fancy bar, nor is it well lit or particularly inviting. It began as a speak easy during the prohibition era that was fronted by a tool store. The titular Mae ran her bar out of the basement, where it remains to this day. This was and is THE bar for my friends and I. I haven't lived in Manhattan for over a year, and I still get waved through by the door guys. Their signature drinks are the tarantula, which is a version of a Long Island that will murder you; Moscow Mules, always on special; and $1.75 PBR and High Life cans.

* Rock a Belly Deli: If you are a beer person, I would recommend Rock a Belly Deli, which has a pretty sold collection of rotating taps. It's a very ""grad student"" bar.

* Aggie Station: Aggie Station makes a hell of a cocktail and has a clientele of older students and young graduates, and as an fun yet controlled vibe. It was usually where we ended our nights in the Ville.

*Random Trivia/Tidbits*

***

* Earl Woods, the father of Tiger Woods, played baseball for Kansas State.

* The inventor of the snooze button was a K-State grad.

* [Eric Stonestreet, who plays Cameron on Modern Family, is an alumnus of Kansas State University.](http://media.whosay.com/113897/1/113897_la.jpg) He goes to a lot of the games, and occasionally speaks at pep rallies.

* [Kansas Wildcat March](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2egwk-eCH4): John Philip Sousa was a famous composer known for his marches, such as The Stars and Stripes Forever, Semper Fidelis, and The Washington Post. In October, 1928, John Philip Sousa was to make an appearance at K-State. A petition, signed by most of the student body, was presented to Sousa on October 10, requesting that he compose a Kansas State Agricultural College march. Two and a half years later, in the spring of 1931, he sent the Music Department a piano arrangement of the Kansas Wildcat March. The marching band plays the march during the pregame show before football games, and during parades.

* Our basketball team is in the background of [this popular photo](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/302/170/685.png), where you can see [Will Spradling](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Will+Spradling+12+Basketball+Tournament+Quarterfinals+UgDvSz5WEshl.jpg) and [Thomas Gibson](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/4347507/141490589.0_standard_352.0.jpg) wearing our away uniforms. Between that and [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/20jgqn1.jpg), I'm fairly certain Barack Obama is secretly a K-State fan

* During the 2012-2013 academic year, the football team, men's basketball team, and baseball team all won at least a share of a conference title. Kansas State is one of four schools to accomplish this feat in the BCS era, along with Stanford, Texas, and Louisville. All three teams were predicted to finish in the bottom half of the Big 12 this last year.

* [Cool video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNElr5BQMgg) that our Athletic Department released earlier this year. Also, [here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbIdnJnrbtI) the video they made when the basketball team won the Regular Season Conference Title
