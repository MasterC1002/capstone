[HDRlabs](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html) - HDR environments?  For **free**? Soooooooooooon

[The-Blueprints](http://www.the-blueprints.com/) Has tons of blueprints of real-world (and some fantasy) vehicles, weapons, and some miscellaneous objects (cellphones and the like).  Most include multiple views already scaled and aligned for modelling.

[BlenderDipom](http://www.blenderdiplom.com/index.php) - High-quality tutorials.

[Blender Nerd](http://blendernerd.com/) - High quality tutorials and a few model downloads.

[Metalix](http://www.metalix.co.nz/) - A rather unpretty site with some tutorials with some useful advice.  Also a few downloads in the vault section.

[Blender Nation](http://www.blendernation.com/) - Probably one of the better Blender news, tutorial, artist showcase and 3D modelling discussion aggregators out there.

[blendtuts](http://blendtuts.com/) - More tutorials!  They have a really good absolute beginner series.

[Vimeo's Blender Tutorial Channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/blendertuts) - has some good stuff.  Also check youtube!


Now, guys, if you're overwhelmed with all the tutorials and feel the need to do them all - **don't.**  While it's generally agreed that you should practice as much as you can, don't feel obligated to tackle each and every tutorial... even though it's probably ""better"" if you do.  The important thing is that you *watch* someone else work, get ideas, tips and advice.

You can learn a bunch just by seeing how a particular artist handles topology or textures or whatever.  I assure you, it will inspire you to want to go in and do what they did on your own models.

Regardless, I'll try to find more resources that aren't listed here sometime soon.  Hopefully I'll find enough to warrant a new post.

Here's the original footage:

http://i.imgur.com/w2dcZzk.jpg

In this scene, the actress is standing in front of an abandoned crashed futuristic helicopter. The helicopter shouldn't pop too much, but not blend in to much either. Here's what I modeled:

http://i.imgur.com/ASj0wKR.png

Then I composited the two together, and this is the result:

**http://i.imgur.com/aRNCBGe.jpg**

There are a few issues:

- The broken off wing and the broken off propeller nearest to the camera look wonky.

- The occlusion of the fallen trees over the heli seems off too.

Can I get some criticism?

Around that, anyway. I learned the same way most do, using various tutorials online and some books as well. I feel like I've progressed leaps and bounds, and hope that shows in my work. I want to get into the 3D industry doing either hard surface modelling, or environment modelling. I need to get more practice in environment modelling, but it seems fun. Let me know what you all think of my work!

This is my first post here, but i've been browsing for a while, finally got the confidence to make a post. 

My name is Ciaran and I'm a game programmer with only minor modelling skills so I've been learning blender for the past 13 days or so spending around 2 hours on it a day to improve my 3d modelling and rendering capabilities for my games, so here's one of my first compositions that was completely self made.

Thanks,

I rendered this scene like 5 times with different objects and lightning until I finally got what I wanted. I started with a vase, then a textured vase, then a wine bottle, a different and more improved wine bottle, I then got to a couple of whiskey glasses and the whiskey bottle, and finally after many tries, I rendered this. Three whiskey glasses and their whiskey bottle.

I know this is not a super-realistic-WOW scene, but I still consider myself new in blender and I really enjoy how this image turned out.

Image was rendered at 3000 samples using cycles; it only took about 11 hours. I then edited it in another software to remove some of the remaining noise, add some more blur, etc.

Hope you guys like it and thank you all of you who helped me and gave me advice throughout the process.

This is the new reel of mostly blender works I am working on. I have great expectations for this one, so I need help to make it the best possible in the time I have.

My intention is to get into an university and/or get a job in europe, canada or australia. So, my questions are:

-What is too bad and should be left out?

-What is good and should be in the beginning?

-What could be improved with what I have?

And some important, non related questions:

-Does anyone has a list of companies that uses blender that I could send this reel to? If possible, please, PM me with them, if it is not a problem.

-Where is the best place I could post this to get this help I need? I posted it in blenderartists. Any place else?

And, finaly, this little dude was left out (the boat is from blendswap), do you guys think I should include it?

http://youtu.be/eCl1btv2U9g

There are also some videos in my old youtube account, if you think there is anything I should add..

http://www.youtube.com/user/guismoale


In the final version I will put the softwares, credits and everything that is missing. I also intend to remake the opening simulation and the dragon simulation.

**[austeregrim](http://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/yw7az/august_contest_entryvoting_thread/)** won the last r/blender contest and got to choose this month's theme -- an interesting one!

***
**Septempber Contest**    
austeregrim: ""I'd like to see people challenged to bring a 3d creation down to a 2d level with back lighting to create silhouettes. Could be anything from a cowboy riding off into the sunset, to a writing utensil and a lamp. I think this will challenge people to use and understand lighting, and will be a good challenge.""

***
**Contest Rules**    

* Rule #1: All rules are generally flexible. ;) We're not Blender nazis. :P

------------

**Planning**

Before you make anything, some planning must be involved. Planning is a paramount feature of the design process. This can be anywhere from formulating a rough idea of what you want to emulate to intensive research on geographical formations and countless sketches of portions of your intended piece. It all depends on what you need.

For the piece I showed the other day, all I had in mind was a woodland cliff, with a waterfall/river and a cave, because I'm making a game in this setting. It's a simple idea, really.

Take a moment and decide on what you wish to model after, and then continue on to the next section where I will lead you through my technique. I am writing this in a way that outlines the general workflow and techniques you might use. It is not a step-by-step tutorial; I am offering this only as a guide on technique and workflow. You must drive the content of your creation.

**Base Mesh**

You will want to start with something very, very rough. Something that only outlines the most basic form and shape of your intended result.

For comparison, I started with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/VvrlW.png).

**Techniques**

*Multi-Resolution and Sculpting*

Yes, this was done with the use of the Multi-resolution modifier and Sculpt mode.

Do not needlessly increase the mesh resolution; do what you can first with what is available. A lot of this technique involves building on layers you have created in previous resolutions. In some cases, you may want to exaggerate a feature in a low resolution only to bring it back to proportions with more refined detail later.

The great thing about these tools is that they have a very forgiving nature.

*Brushes to Use*

A few brushes can give some good results in rocky or otherwise irregular formations. My favorite to use for these is the *Clay Strips* brush. It give a lot of texture and has a nice build-up and subtraction effect. To create the cliff face in my example, I would alternate between different strengths, addition/subtraction, and stroke direction. Playing around with this can result in good results.

Another brush I used frequently was the *Blob* brush. I used this on parts that I wanted to pop out, like boulders and rocks. It's fairly straight forward to use.

Experimentation is key to this technique. Play around with certain brushes -- you can always undo! This is it for the general technique. Below I will expand on some of my techniques for individual parts of my scene.

**Details**

After you have everything blocked out and have increased the resolution a few times, you'll notice that it is much easier to impart details into the mesh. I'll go over some of the things I did in my piece here.

*Rocks*

First, I would use the *Blob* brush to rough them out. After I get the basic shape I want, I will use a small, strong *Clay Strips* brush in subtraction mode to enhance the crease between the rock and the ground (this may have to be done at a higher resolution). Afterwards, I like to decrease the strength a bit, increase the size a bit, and work on addint some depth in the rock around the edges to separate it from the ground a bit more. I typically use this same brush in a mixture of addition/subtraction to texture the surface of the rock as well.

Here are some of mine, at varying levels of detail: [rocks](http://i.imgur.com/tIG2H.jpg)

*Cliff Face*

The cliff face is the result of many layers of back-and-forth addition/subtraction with various sizes and strengths of the *Clay Strips* brush. It takes some playing around, but once you get a feel for it it is very easy.

Here is a closer look at mine: [cliff face](http://i.imgur.com/b2bie.jpg)

*Cave opening*

This one seems to be what people are most interested in. It's actually very easy and involves, you guessed it, the *Clay Strips* brush. I would start subtracting portions in lower resolutions all the way through my highest, adding little details as I see fit. I would also build up ""clay"" around the top and sides to create a more pronounced overhang, texturing everything similar to how I did the cliff faces.

Here's mine: [cave opening](http://i.imgur.com/HMn6s.jpg)

------

To close this off, I'd just like to say to let it flow. Make changes and add details where it feels right. It helps if you have a graphics tablet, but it's not necessary.

Imagine years of erosion by water, dust, and wind; create a history for your scene and run it through your head all the time. Look at pictures online for inspiration.

I hope this helped someone out there. I'm happy to answer any further questions or elaborate on anything! If you would like more pictures or maybe some progress shots of another scene, I can do that, too.

Cutting a circle into a mesh technique: Delete the appropriate vertices from where you want your circle. Then select the edge loop of the circle and press ALT+SHIFT+S. Drag your mouse right after that to start conforming those vertices into a circle.

To recalculate normals (This can fix funky shadows) select all vertices in edit mode and press CTRL+N.

To turn selection of vertices to new mesh, select appropriate vertices in edit mode,  press p key, then ""by selection"".

After adding a subsurf modifier, select all the vertices in edit mode then press SHIFT+E to adjust the subsurf's levels."	t5_2qim4	True

Before you comment, here are some things:

- The explosion is on the moon because I had a deadline to meet and modelling an exploding building is completely out of my skill range! (also, it was meant to be a desert, but most people seem to think it is the moon..... probably due to the bad lighting.)
- the light moving during the minions walking away part was not meant to happen.... I think that I accidentally deleted a key frame.
- Those red things hovering beside his wrists are left overs from a failed shrinkwrap modifier to make clothing.... I must have forgot about them because in the original position of the mesh they are hidden in the wrists.
-I know the video is bad quality, but my computer isn't great, and it can't take any more samples. The render at this quality took over 30 hours!!
