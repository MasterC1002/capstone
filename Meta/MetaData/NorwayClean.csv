We did some touristy stuff (Norway in a nutshell, Vikingship museum, etc) but we also had a blast just checking out the bars and talking with the locals all over Norway. And thanks for letting us know about the duvets :) Or as we ended up calling them ""lava blankets"". Holy crap those things kept us warm! So just some quick observations...

- the most difficult thing about Norway was the lack of darkness. Having it still be light at 11:30pm really messed with our heads and made sleeping difficult
- Yes, it was expensive, but I would say it was comparable to New York or San Francisco
- You all LOVE your Converse All-Star shoes, especially in white
- We stumbled upon a giant Boy Scout Jamboree in Stavanger... THAT was weird. 
- I read that Norweigians had a reputation for being cold and untalkative. I found that to be the total opposite. It wasn't just people in the service industry that were talking to us, but the people we met at restaurants, at bars, everywhere. 

Thanks for a great time. Pictures soon. :)"	t5_2qwrb	True

As a born-and-bred Norwegian I often find it hard to try to view Norwegian society from a foreigners point of view, and this kind of topic so rarely comes up that I would find it very interesting to hear what you have to say.

*I would also like to remind my fellow Norwegians of the [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and don't down vote or be rude (and preferably don't argue the points that are made at all) to people who criticize Norway or say things  in this thread that you might not particularly agree with.

I'm (23f) living in Trondheim and moved here after I graduated from uni in the UK over a year ago. At first I did the usual, go out to bars, try and join different societies, classes, I even did a lot of online dating in an attempt to meet people. But the people I met just weren't interested in getting any more friends! I took some dance classes for a while but the people there were mostly in their 40s...so that didn't work. I work part time as a staff member at the university here, so lurking around student events and stuff feels a little weird (plus no membership, plus plus I know no-one). I've gone to parties alone in an attempt to get to know people, and though it kinda works for a while, people just don't seem interested.

I can speak Swedish fluently though not always confidentally (with random Norwegian words thrown in haha) so language barriers aren't usually my problem. I do prefer to chat in English though...

Does anyone have any advice?? I can feel myself turning into a hermit which is no bueno, so any advice is appreciated :)

1364108450.0	1awkdm	Norway.  I just don't understand.  Can someone explain it to me like I am five?	varvarvar	60	9	140	"Finally finished booking my trip to Norway, and the cost (aside from the surprisingly cheap airfare) is just mind boggling, even in comparison to Switzerland. 

Driven by curiosity, I did look into the issue.  I understand that Norweigans with ordinary jobs are paid well, very well, compared to Americans, i.e. grocery store clerk will probably earn at least USD 25 per hour compared with our minimum wage of USD 8. However, I also note that Norweigans with typically high-earning professional jobs do not earn nearly as much as their American counterparts, i.e. doctors, lawyers, bankers, etc.  

Okay, in my experience, very few clerks, waiters, bus drivers can afford to live in Manhattan, New York, generally considered the most expensive area in the US.  Professionals make up a large percentage of Manhattan dwellers and even they grumble about the cost. However, prices in Norway, even outside major cities, are more expensive or at least on a par with Manhattan.  So how do the people manage?  The USD 20 fast food meals and USD 50 pizzas just seem surreal. While fine dinning in Manhattan can be obscenely costly, it is balanced out by the availability of $2 pizza slice and $7 lunch specials on every street corner.  In Norway, not so much.  I earn quite a bit more than the average Norweigan, but even I feel that I can't afford to live (or at least in a carefree style) in Norway on a long-term basis.  

So, can someone explain it to me like I am five how Norweigans manage to have a relatively easy life on the whole, for it appears that the country is ranked very near the top when it comes to citizens' satisfaction level.  Without knowing more, I would have expected many Norweigan doctors and lawyers to leave the country for US or somewhere where they would have more earnings and less expense.  Of course, that is a purely financial analysis and not taking into account of how awesome Norway is in many respects.  "	t5_2qwrb	True

Would love some advice on dating a Norwegian guy. 	roksa	54	2	89	"Long story short, I met this pretty cool Norwegian guy a while back through some mutual colleagues and we have become casual friends. We have a lot in common work wise as well as similar ideologies. He asked me out to dinner and beers a couple of times and it seemed like a date until nothing happened. We split the bill 50/50. Then he acts totally platonic. We text all the time. At least once or twice a day and usually he initiates, but it's always something pretty random and not sexual or romantic. 

A couple of weeks later he asks me to come hang out again. Frustrated, I work up the nerve to text him asking if he's interested in me or what. He replies yes, he's interested in me, thinks I'm attractive and also is interested in getting to know me as a person. 

Ok, great. 

The next ""date"" he asks me on is to go with him to the computer store. WTF. Why on earth am I going with this guy to the god damn computer store? Other than my obvious crush. I'm so confused!

Norwegians of reddit, what is going on? And more importantly, how do I seduce this guy?

I was fresh to reddit, but I had seen the incredible use and flow of new (and mostly correct) information. I was watching links of directly uploaded pictures from the bombsites and I was watching the debate about who could have done it. I was appalled by the stigma against muslims and when my facebook feed blew up in rage against muslims (I even read reports of minorities that were attacked in the short time after the bomb) I was disgusted. 

When I heard about the shootings on Utøya I immediatly tried to reach my friends, but I couldn't reach through. I am so insanely grateful that my friends survived that night, and I can't wait to see them later today.

I can't say that I was very interested in my country before this, and I did not have have much of a nationalistic feel, but when I saw, participated and cried with the rest of my country in the days following I knew that I lived in the world's greatest nation. I am also so thankful for the government for not trying to push through laws and regulations in an attempt to halt future massacres or acts of terrorism, but instead decide to act with more democracy and openness, but never naivety. I am glad I won't live my adult life in a paranoid and scared society. 

Do me a favour and hug your friends &amp; family today. You never know which day will be your last to do so. I love you.

The reply i got was no but i could make it myself and it would get linked to in the side panel. So i need your help fellow /r/Norway folk to create a FAQ that will answer most if not all of the FAQs a person could ask on here.

Some things i think should be uncluded in the FAQ

* Going on vacation, what do do in.. (List over things to do in major cities and even in smaller cities/tows across the country)
* I'm moving to .... what can i expect/what are some differences from my country. (List of general Norwegian things e.g Booze is expensive)
* General pricing (day to day items maybe more)
* I want to move to Norway, how would i go about doing that? (Link to sites for jobs/housing/green card and general tips from people that have already moved to Norway would be great.)
* Teaching yourself norwegian, where to start.
That's what i can think of for now. I will add things to the list as you can help come up with them. 

Places I would love info on (As i don't live there myself)

- Oslo
* Trondheim
* Bergen
* Stavanger
* Kristiansand

While sleeping at his brother-in-laws house, the viking Vestein gets killed by an assasin, skewering him on a spear. The dying Vestein then rises and says:
""Det råka godt (That struck well)

A viking fighting for Olav the Holy at Stiklestad gets an arrow in the eye. The man pulls the arrow out, his eyeball still on out it, and says:
""Det jaggu nærme nasen! (That was damn close the my nose)""

Another viking fighting for Olav at Stiklestad gets an arrow through his heart. He manages to pull the arrow out and study it. With his dying breath he says:
""Eg har fettslintrat kring hjartet. Kongen har fødd meg vel. (I have fat arround my heart. The king has fed me well)"".

Hope you enjoy them!"	t5_2qwrb	True

Recently a document surfaced indicating that he had died in a POW camp in 1945. I am trying to locate the town/city/grave as per the document but am having trouble as I do not know Norway geography. Here is the title page of the document http://obd-memorial.ru/memorial/fullimage?id=73120461&amp;id1=c42fe14e68e02b1342268a4d8163b5d8&amp;path=Z/010/058-0018003-1609/00000291.jpg - and here is the document with my great grandfather's name http://obd-memorial.ru/memorial/fullimage?id=73120527&amp;id1=04895eb6baed742c97eb2410965c4593&amp;path=Z/010/058-0018003-1609/00000293.jpg (his entry is #67) indicating that he is buried in a mass grave in OPDAL (I am unsure if this refers to an acronym or a city). Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much.

**EDIT 1**: Thank you all so much for the responses. It looks like we've narrowed it down to Oppdal. I'm trying to figure out the address of the monument and the names of those buried in the mass grave there. According to this: http://www.krigsgraver.no/search?q=%2BplaceOfDeath%3A%28oppdal~%29 there are 73 people buried in Oppdal. I wonder if they are all buried at the same site.

**EDIT 2**: I have emailed 1) Three people at Falstad
                                       2) The township of Oppdal
                                       3) The local newspaper at Oppdal
                                       4) Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs
                                       5) Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Unfortunately, I am yet to hear from anyone. I hope they reply soon. Thank you Norway. I am forever grateful for the out poor of support and help. You are an amazing nation and I am truly grateful. 

**EDIT 3** Dear /r/Norway - today I had gotten a confirmation from the Min. of Gov. Administration of Norway and from Falstad that my Great Grand Father is indeed buried at the Oppdal Memorial Cite as many of you have pointed out. Again, I have no words to express my gratitude to all of you for all of your help and support. If I can be of use to any of you, please do not hesitate to ask. Also, I am planning on making a trip in the coming year to Oppdal. If there are people who live in Oppdal and can give me pointers on the best possible way to travel there (as well as lodging bookings etc) I would really appreciate it. I will most likely be flying in from Canada or Moscow to Oslo. Again, thank you all so much.

Lilyhammer is a new 8 part mini-series that is about a mafia boss from NY (No other than Van Zandt) that moves to Lillehammer after falling in love of the city after the 94 olympics. I personally believe that this can easily match Trolljegeren (The Troll Hunter).

The series makes a lot of points about what i guess foreigners believe about Norway(Wolfs all over the place, we ski a lot, we eat sheap heads and we wear sweathers all the time). And of course, the fact that you have an american running around yelling ""What the fuck!"" makes everything even better.

So far even our beloved social services (NAV) has been ""hit hard"".

A little ""warning"" if you are researching about Norway:
- It is a comedy, do not believe everything
- The english we norwegians speak is normal, and yes, it is horrible.

My student residence permit expired at the end of February.  Renewal required transfer of funds from my home country to Norway and this took WAY longer than expected, due to the incompetence of DnbNOR.  While I was waiting for the transfer I took a trip in January to my home country and came back to Norway with a stamp in my passport and assurances from the border police that I could stay here on a tourist visa while I waited for my renewal to come through.  The border police officer also called her supervisor who said ""No problem"".

Today when I was handing in my renewal papers the policewoman said that I should have waited 3 months after the expiration of my residence permit before reentering Norway and that I was now staying here illegally.  She then gave me a blank piece of paper to state my reasons, and included it in her report to UDI.  She said if I applied for renewal while staying here illegally, my chances weren't good.  ""Better to go back to your home country and apply from there."" -- well, flights aren't cheap!

1366088549.0	1cfzo0	Does anyone know this children's song?	Searocksandtrees	32	0	19	"Hi /r/Norway! When my father was little (ca 1935), he had a children's book of songs or nursery rhymes sent from relatives in Bergen. My father can only remember one song, which he called ""The Goat Song"" because there was a picture of a goat. We have been trying to find the correct words. Maybe someone here knows it?

Dad did not speak Norwegian, so the words were meaningless sounds to him. He was very little, so he doesn't remember it well any more, but here's what he thinks it sounded like (English spelling):

    O-yay-vet-und-setter
    miss-ay-mong-und-vetter
    no-en-har-und-beyeller
    nordy-gordy-feyeller
    ring-a-ring-a-lang-lang-lang!

    horny-kloppen
    rag-unter-stoppen
    listy-o-lasty
    o-let-po-ta

Mange takk!

**Edit: thanks everyone for your links, quotes, and translations! I just wanted to pass along that my dad was very grateful to have *finally* found this song: we had given up hope on ever finding it - so thanks helpful people of /r/Norway! The video absolutely made his day - and made him cry! The whole family was really surprised how well he had remembered the words &amp; tune (we all thought it was gibberish), and are so happy to have reclaimed this tiny piece of our Norwegian heritage.  P.S. if anyone wants to try translating the last few verses, that would be appreciated too - Google Translate made a bit of a mess of it! :)**"	t5_2qwrb	True

1371145462.0	1ga4hx	Renting and my landlord just got very upset... advice please?	deten	31	2	21	"Hello, my wife and i are renting an apartment and we had a crappy situation arise.

I got a call today from the landlord that the apartment was being sold, and that Tuesday of next week we had to be out for a viewing between 5 and 6 (or 6 and 7, I dont remember exactly).

I told him that I would check with my wife to see if that was okay (we have a new baby who sleeps during that time) and I would get back to him.  He however insisted that he didn't care if we could/couldn't but that we must get out of the house for that time.  This went back and forth for a bit while I tried to tell him that its not easy to do this on such short notice with a baby considering we have plans and events coming up this weekend.

He replied that we could rent a hotel for the night, and I asked if he was paying which he said no.  Then he started getting very angry and I told him that we have been here for a long time and he should treat me better than this and that I wont talk to him while he is yelling at me.

Long story short, we want to know what our obligations are, and what is considered reasonable notice for these events.

* We have an ongoing standard contract for rental of accommodation that commenced at the end of 2011

* The period of notice of termination is 3 months

* What is the standard method to give notice in Norway?  He hasn't said anything to us, nor has he given us an email stating that notice is being given.  In the US, nothing is considered giving notice except a letter or email, stating that you have notice of termination.  Just saying your selling doesn't count, because some people might change their mind, or decide to sell in so many months.

* How much notice should he give me for viewing of the apartment?  His notice was 5 days, which really isn't much time considering we have to pack all our valuable items and clean and be gone for that time.

* On the tennancy act of 26.03.1999 it says 
&gt;Section 10-1. Availability for viewing prior to vacation of property
&gt;During the period prior to vacation of the property the tenant is obliged to a reasonable extent to allow prospective tenants access to view the property.

Since he has not given me notice, unless it works differently here in Norway, I wouldn't consider this a period prior to vacation... unless every time is time before vacation... since eventually everyone will leave, but I cannot believe that law is that odd.

* Final question, what do I do when/if he shows up on Tuesday?

Our landlord has been an okay guy, though our Norwegian neighbors all say he is a scumbag.  It wasn't until today that I saw that side of him.  I just want to make sure that everyone follows the rules, and if I need to go... we will survive, but I think his method for doing this was really poor.  Especially since he could have talked to us before making these plans and we could  have worked out a good time.

I'm a swede who's been visiting this great city over the weekend. While I love Trondheim's sights, people, and atmosphere, I've run into a problem due to the ""nothing open on Sundays"" deal. See, yesterday while walking around I found myself in the store ""Retro"", where I bought a shirt. This morning however I noticed that I had accidentally bought the wrong size. I have the receipt and the shirt is unworn so it would not be an issue, were it not for the fact that I'm leaving town tonight. 

This is why I turn to you reddit - to see if anyone can give me a hand by accepting a bag with a shirt in it, and returning it to a Retro store sometime during the week (I'm hoping I'll be able to communicate with the store on my own to see if I can get the right size shipped back home). If anyone is in the area and feel like helping a fellow Scandinavian out I would be extremely grateful!

1369764711.0	1f7o9f	Love or Stupidity?	zzachery	28	4	26	"The story as to how I found love in Norway is twisted and complex. I understand the idea of love and the word is sensitive in Norwegian social context and any of that gushy crap americans like to use and Norwegians seem to stray from. Regardless upon visiting Norway for a month I found love, for the country and for a beautiful woman. 

She has visited me here at my hometown in San Diego and while reluctant to verbalize her feelings, does in fact feel the same way for me. We decided that we didn't want to put pressure on the relationship by attaching a title to it, and that trying to do the long distance relationship thing rarely works. But neither of us has seen anyone or moved on and certainly don't want to.

Now my life is currently on the brink of large changes and I don't know which path to choose.

I was accepted to a university here in the states, and my original plan was to finish my BA in Industrial Design quickly and then apply for graduate school at Oslo School of Architecture and Design, thus solidifying a possibility for future skilled labor and work/residence in Norway after receiving an MA.

My torment is, as any 22 year old is, I don't know if I want to do that. I miss her deeply and as a person that generally keeps my emotions subdued and logical I am overwhelmed and flush with this strange feeling. It is a feeling so powerful that I simply want to liquidate my assets and move to Norway, young, American, unskilled, with a little grasp of the language, and no ability to get a work visa under my circumstances. However, I am tenacious. I know which ever plan I decide to go with I will do my best to succeed. She is going to visit me once more at the end of August right before my schooling starts. If things go well I am going to talk to her about the situation and decide whether to choose to go with my mind or my heart.

I guess I have come here today, with questions as well as responses on both sides of this dilemma.

I am a bicycle mechanic by trade. I have met a few shop owners in Norway and imagine with my long experience I would be able to get some sort of under the table job. I also have experience in bar tending and restaurant jobs. I figure I would find American expats that might sympathize with my situation and help me out. But most importantly if I were to state any exemplifying quality about myself I would say that I am an extremely hard worker. I have worked three jobs and gone to school full time and supported my two younger brothers with my alcoholic mother for the last 3 years. When it comes to survival and my happiness, I will find a way. 

Do you know anyone that lives illegally in Norway (especially American)?

Will illegal work be hard to get? I will shovel ditches in the snow for 12hours a day if it comes down to it.

Also I don't want to be some sort of leech on Norway. I am an American who has had the idea of being completely self-reliant and independent instilled him. However I am a very social person and I want to be able to give back, and pay my fair share for the services I will undoubtedly at some point need to use.

If I over stay my visa, how much trouble will I get in?

I have multiple friends in Norway and know if I had to find a place to stay I could find one and I know I would probably just live with my girlfriend, but how hard would it be to rent my own flat?

What is the possibility of this becoming a permanent situation, will I be able to make this a sustainable option without a formal college degree? 

How normal is it for the average Norwegian not to have a college education and still afford the life there?

All of the Norwegians I have met, have either graduated or are currently enrolled in school. I have never met working class Norwegians. 

I mean is this fucking stupid idea?

I understand that my happiness doesn't rely on a person, but I'm going crazy thinking that I might miss a once in a life opportunity if I don't do this. Waiting seems like the most reasonable, but damnit it hurts.

I don't know, I am gast for words. My friends say do it (even one that did the same with thing with her swedish girlfriend living in Oslo)! I tell myself I am not afraid to lose everything, but a part of my logical brain has that feeling lingering. I guess I need more advice from a completely different perspective.

There has been a great deal of news coverage from Norway here in the UK and globally in recent days for obvious and very sad reasons. However, in all of the coverage I have seen and heard only proud, intelligent, thoughtful, considered, well-educated and fluently multi-lingual people. There is beautiful countryside, clean cities, an apparent air of affluence, and an almost sickeningly attractive population.  

No one can judge a nation negatively by the actions of one lunatic, and if anything the reaction to the tragedy has led me to view Norway more positively. 

I’ve only seen evidence of good things. Can I judge by what I’ve seen on the TV recently, or is it unrepresentative because people and pictures have been chosen to suit the interests of the media?

I'm Icelandic. I have no immediate Norwegian ancestry. I have no friends in Norway directly affected by this. I have never lived in Norway, and I only speak the language through distorted Danish. And I am usually quite good at compartmentalizing my empathy in order to be able to hear news such as this and function as a human being.

But not this time. My entire weekend was spent sleepless, either reading about the events in Utøya or simply staring at the ceiling. I have come close to tears a couple of times. And the absolute worst part is my compulsion to understand people, to truly get into their heads, which is driving me to some very uncomfortable and horrifying conclusions right now. I can just about understand him, feel his rage and his detachment from humanity; the smell, taste of this mind is repulsive yet intriguing to me at the same time.

I swallowed my agnosticism and prayed the other night, because if I am wrong, then this is the best time to admit it, to falter from my normally skeptical self.

I cannot imagine what Norwegians feel right now, truly, in their heart of hearts. To the victims, survivors and families I can only offer my hollow condolences.

Everythings looking pretty good and we're already making rough plans for a wedding in Norway - my other half knows that Im going to ask her and its simply a question of when, probably when I go to Norway for christmas.

But.

I'd really like to ask her parents for their blessing (not permission since we both feel thats a outdated relic)of the engagement with one flaw - my norwegian isnt currently up to scratch to ask them and their english is about as good as my norwegian. 

So I was wondering what the Norwegian attitude is towards the idea of asking for a blessing?

Granted, I only spent about 7 days there, but I didn't want to leave.  I spent 2 nights in Oslo, 2 nights in Tromsø, and 3 nights in Longyearbyen.  When I return, I hope to have time to make the drive from Oslo to Hammerfest.

I'm from the southern US (Arkansas), so the change in weather was pretty extreme, but it was awesome.   Everyone was extremely nice and helpful.   

I just felt compelled to say all this, and to all the Norwegians out there you should be really proud of your country.  It's amazing.  Also, just about every girl I saw was very attractive.  My dad is almost 60 and he said he felt 20 just seeing the number of beautiful women around.

Any advice from Norwegians on what to do for my return trip? 

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice so far!  I want to spend a lot more time there on my return trip, maybe 2-3 weeks.  It won't be able to happen till next year some time, but I'm looking into all the stuff you have told me about.  Thanks again. "	t5_2qwrb	True

I am sure we have a few differences and I was hoping you could give me some tips of anything that I should avoid or anything that could help me get some friends here.

I understand language is not a major issue but still I am planning on getting some language classes in a few weeks cause it's a clear indication of respecting the country that is having you.

I'm a high school 4th year going to graduate soon, and I've been very interested in visiting Norway recently. The minimal research I've done has shown me very little information about summer programs I can afford (and yes I understand the difference between US dollars and kroner). 

I'm currently considering creating an independent program for myself, either involving couchsurfing, hostels, or an unconsidered option (hotels? hell no). I knew a Norwegian exchange student in high school from Trondheim, and I'd love to spend some time there. I don't speak Norwegian, sadly, but I've been told the majority of people speak English (and I'm happy to start picking the language up).

This is all very idealistic, and frankly, somewhat of a fantasy considering I come from a low income background. Any information, suggestions, or optimism I will appreciate. Pessimism will have it's place once the trip has been planned.

Takk.

When this happened, she went through a lot of hardship, and this was partly because the information available on other churches, information available was erroneous, and heavily biased, in a way that most of her friends and relatives stopped talking to her.

I am not going to go into much detail about her life, but at age 50 she went back to University, graduated, edited a book called ""Dette tror vi : 37 norske trossamfunn og liv[s]synsorganisasjoner presenterer seg selv"" where different religions and beliefs were able to explain themselves what their beliefs are.

Rigmor passed away today, we live in England, and my wife will soon be giving birth, so we will not be able to attend her funeral, so it would mean the world to us if some of you would like to take a look at the book she wrote.

I, (m/32) and my Mom, we are going to visit Tromso for vacation.   
  
Before you say “WTF, with your Mom”? My Dad died a couple of years ago. And he always would go to vacations with her around the globe. Now that he’s gone, she is alone. I have made it a point to continue that by planning at least one vacation with her every year.  
  
From my previous journeys, I have learned that it is not ancient buildings, giant sculptures and historic places that define a country, but it's their people.  
  
Therefore, I would love to meet you to share life stories, experiences,  personal views and maybe learn about things that are special to Norwegians. In exchange, I can tell you a lot about the same for Switzerland, which is where I come from.  
  
Maybe you can tell me about that cutest cafe in the backstreet where no tourist usually goes. Maybe there is this restaurant that makes the best &lt;Norwegian speciality food&gt; and no Tourist knows it, because it is only a small Family managed place. Maybe you know a cool place one might go in the evening for a drink or maybe there is a special event in that week in a theatre or outdoor happening or…   
I don’t know - That’s why I am asking you!  
  
I can communicate in fluid German, English, Turkish and a bit of French.  
  
We will be staying in a hotel in the middle of Tromso, probably the Thon Polar. 

Date: 16. – 23.02.2013

So I was hoping that you guys may have some insight. I read over the past ""moving"" posts and could not get a clear idea about some of the issues I may face. 

Also, I suggest this topic becomes an FAQ with some of the common questions being answered.

So here's a little bit about me:

* I'm 22, have a 23 year old wife, and soon to have a 3 year old little girl (adopted). Also, have 3 dogs that I want to bring with me.
* I'm a middle class software developer working primarily as a web developer (PHP, MySQL, PgSQL, html/css/js, etc.) and have a pretty decent job but...
* I've no formal education in my practice. Meaning, I've 2 years of college, no degree, no certificate.
* I am currently living in the US as a permanent resident (and have for a decade) BUT I was born in central Europe and have a valid passport. Not sure if it's considered an ""EU"" passport but it's one of those microchipped passports and I got it about 5 years ago. It's a 10-year passport.
* My wife is russian but she became a US citizen over a decade ago. She doesn't have a degree nor has she had a formal job in the past couple of years. She worked as a freelance photographer and now works as a freelance model.
* I'm hoping to move after the adoption of my daughter is finalized (within 2 years or so).

**My Questions**

* How hard is it for an EU citizen to move to your country? How about a citizen of another European country? How about a US citizen?
* What's the best way to learn your language? Do I need to know both of the official languages?
* As a software engineer, is it hard to find a job in this field in your country?
* Is it hard to find a job without a degree? I have over 5 years of experience and by the time I'd like to leave, I'll be considered a senior in my field. I'm currently already qualified for ~85K jobs in the US. 
* How are you on credit? In the US, credit is paramount. I was wondering if I'll have to get myself into debt in Norway in order to prove I can pay for stuff.
* How hard is it to get a place? Will I require any special documentation? Or deposits?
* I checked out the requirements for bringing pets overseas but saw only two ways to do it: plane or boat. Both of which are unsafe. Any of you have experience with bringing pets overseas with you? Legally speaking, it's not hard to get through paperwork and circumvent quarantine.

I've been checking this subreddit from time to time so I know you get these questions all the time, but I guess I just want some more individualized advice.

I'm an American, born and raised, but I would really like to live in Norway for a few years after I graduate from college. I know I'll need to get a job in which I'll use my education to qualify for a work visa to live in Norway. I'm learning Swedish right now in my university and I'm under the impression that Swedish and Norwegian are similar enough to communicate, but even so my Swedish probably won't be fluent by the time I graduate. I figure that’s not too big of a problem since almost all Norwegians speak English, but I’ve noticed being proficient in Norwegian is a requirement on a lot of job postings. My major is physics and I'm getting a computer science minor. I also do a lot of research (physics and molecular biology), but that’s really my only applicable work experience. I would really like to do something that requires a decent amount of math (maybe something in finance), since I have pretty good analytic skills. I know about nav.no, but there doesn't seem to be that many jobs out there that I think I'll fit the requirements for.

Basically I could use some tips on how to job hunt in Norway without being there and tips on how to make myself more employable in Norway’s economy. I still have another two years of education to go before I graduate university so this is really forward thinking, but I figured it’s better to plan ahead. Also, if you have any advice on the actual logistics of moving overseas, I could use that too.

I've seen a lot of threads about students wanting to move, but very very few working professionals wanting to move and fewer in my industry. Please offer any answers you can.

My fiancee and I are looking to move from San Francisco, CA to Norway sometime in the next year(after marriage in May). What steps can we take to prepare for such an occurance? I have 6 items listed below, but if you think there are more please feel free to leave a comment.

I've been floating the idea around for a while, but got serious about moving out of the US about 2 months ago.
[How economic inequality harms societies](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html) is a great talk about how social policy can effect a country and that along with the Human Development Index (especially the Inequality-adjusted HDI) have me concerned about my future life here.

My story is not super unique - Millions of people have striven to move themselves and their families to better countries to allow for a better life. I feel like I'm doing the same.

I've chosen Norway due to it's ranking as the best country to live during like 2002-2006 and again from 2009-2011. Also I'm 1/4 Norwegian and my fiance is 1/4 or higher(I forget). I'm open to Sweden &gt; Denmark&gt; Finland &gt; Netherlands &gt; Belgium &gt; Switzerland &gt; Germany&gt; Austria. I really feel Norway is my goal though.

**About us:** We've fairly active. Runners, Hiking, Biking, love to travel. We're mid twenties caucasian(as I've heard this will make it easier). We have a good savings that could make the whole process easier as well.

**Questions/Concerns:**

1. **Jobs**
I'm a Front-End software developer so I primarily code in Javascript, html, and css. I have about a year's worth of work experience. I believe there is a solid desire for this field there. How big is that desire? How growing is that community?
My Fiance is an auditor with a big 4 company in the US. She will probably move into accounting or finance soon though. She has 2-2.5 years of experience.
We both have degrees: me in Computer Information Systems, her in Business accounting and finance.
I've read a lot of posts here about how hard it is to get a job in a EU country due to that company requiring that the job is not able to be filled by anyone in the EU. How hard is it going to be to find a job? How many companies are willing to support work Visas?

2. **Language**
We're both totally open and willing to learn Norwegian. I've only learned how to say ""Excuse me"" and a combination of ""Do you/I know/don't know/know a little English/Norwegian"". How much of a barrier is this going to be to #1? I've read that software isn't as dependent on it and I can pick it up afterwards, but if you have more insight that would be great. Especially for her field.
There is a local School - [The Scandinavian School](http://www.scandinavianschool.org/) in San Francisco that I am looking into. Not too pricey. $280 for 8 sessions of 1.5 hours each.

3. **Food**
We're both healthy eaters. Organic fruit mostly, Whole grain carbs, lean meats (Chicken, fish). How much of this is an option in Norway? I expect the default food to be 10x better but I'd really like to be able to eat only whole grains carbs. Is this an option?

4. **Leaving Family**
Sad. We both are fairly close with our immediate family, but as I said I feel this will provide a better life for us and our future children.

5. **Logistically Moving**
How is this accomplished? Can we put stuff in a shipping container and on a boat? Things such as computers, bikes, clothes, etc.

6. **Weather**
We've been in San Francisco for a year so it won't be such a huge change and I've looked at weather and sunlight charts throughout the year. Essentially I expect San Francisco weather with snow during winter months and sunlight differences.


**EDIT 11/25:**
Thanks everyone for all of the advice. I will be sure to follow up. We have a lot going on with wedding and job stuff, but I will be sure to pursue this and update this thread.

**EDIT 11/30:**
So my fiance talked to some people at work and it looks like it might be possible to get some kind of transfer. Rotation would be difficult to get and she'd have to sign up for 2 years, but what seems to be the best option is to talk to a manager/partner and explain that we're planning on moving their permanently and  she'd like to stay with the firm.

So we'll explore that option and see where it can take us. Language classes start mid Jan - I downloaded some teaching material 'til then."	t5_2qwrb	True

As you can guess from my hobbies, I'm really just a home body and am not a highly social person :/ I do admit that I have an ulterior motive to learning Norwegian, and this is that I am applying to work in Norway as an engineer :)

This has been my dream for many years but I was always too shy to try to move to Norway. I have been preparing myself to apply by gaining experience by working for several years as an engineer here in Canada, as well as to try, what I could, to learn the language on my own.

Please let me know if you would like to help me out by chatting with me a bit, and of course any advice for the job hunt would be greatly appreciated (although, I see many topics here for this subject already and didn't feel the need to create another one as the currently posted ones already have so much thoughtful and valuable information in them.

1361732808.0	1956yt	Hey Norway! I've got a question about naming your norwegian child.	This-Charming-Man	21	2	37	"Hi there, 

My norwegian girlfirend is giving birth to our child in a few weeks.
I'm a french citizen and not a norway resident. She will be giving birth in Oslo. We aren't married.

We're having issues with picking a last name for our kid.
My girlfriend has two (like ""Alpha Beta"") and i have one (""Gamma"").

I don't realy care about the child having my last name, and I don't think it'd be smart to give him three last names (""Alpha Beta - Gamma"") but considering that my kid and i will have passports issued form two diferent countries, I'm thinking at least he should have my last name so I don't get arrested everytime i try to travel abroad with him ;)

SO here's my question :
* Can we split my girlfriends name and drop half of it to get something like ""Alpha - Gamma"" or ""Beta - Gamma""
* Can the kid have my name even though we aren't married?

I've been hearing a lot of different things, so i'd love an answer from someone realy familiar with the topic.
I've even heard things as crazy as ""you can't have two last names in norway"" (then how did my grilfriend do?)
or ""she can't only give the kid half her names, sh has to give both or none"".

Any help appreciated!
Have a nice sunday night.

We have a pretty impressive family tree that goes back to the 1700's.  I've heard that my last name comes from either a fjord or a town(ghost town maybe) in Norway.  My last name is Naleid and I have heard that it may derive from a similiar name such as Naley, or Naly.  Naley(?) used to be the name of a fjord or a town.  Whenever I tried seaching google maps, I get no response that's even close.

For many reasons that I don't really need to get into here, my mother has helped me in a lot of ways, especially on overcoming fear in my life. 

I'm looking at getting a tattoo of an inspirational quote, and would love if I could get it translated (as best as possible) into Norwegian by a helpful Redditor or two...

The quote is 'The Litany Against Fear', from Frank Herbert's Dune:

'I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.'

Any assistence would be greatly appreciated, and I will definitely post pictures when it's done!

**EDIT:**

This is from google translate:

**Jeg må ikke frykte.
 Frykt er sinnet-killer. Frykt er det lite død som bringer total utslettelse. Jeg vil møte min frykt. Jeg vil tillate det å passere over meg og gjennom meg. Og når det har gått forbi Jeg vil snu det indre øyet for å se banen.
 Der frykten er borte blir det ingenting. Bare jeg blir værende.**


Thoughts?


**Other Edit:**

Any thoughts on home grown Norwegian quotes would be greatly appreciated as well!


**Edit:**

TIL Norwegians are super helpful, and really good at translating!


**EDIT:**

Here are the attempts so far (I will keep adding) with the usernames underneath:

**Jeg må ikke frykte. Frykt er sinnets morder. Frykt er den lille døden som bringer den totale obliterasjon. jeg skal møte frykten min. jeg vil ikke la den passere igjennom meg. Og når den er forbi meg skal jeg snu det indre øyet og dens sti. Hvor frykt har gått er det ingenting. Kun jeg vil være igjen.**

**SUPERSTEFF1**

**""Jeg må ikke frykte. Frykten er hjernedreperen. Frykten er den lille døden som fører til fullstendig ødeleggelse. Jeg vil møte min frykt. Jeg vil la den passere over meg og gjennom meg. Og når den har passert vil jeg vende mitt indre øye for å se stien den tok. Hvor frykten har gått vil det være tomt. Bare jeg vil bestå.""**

Og når den har passert vil jeg vende mitt indre øye for å se stien den tok. Hvor frykten har gått vil det være tomt. Bare jeg vil bestå.**


**Xrayecho**

**Jeg må ikke frykte. Frykten er en tankemorder. Frykt er den minste døden, som etterlater bare ødeleggelse. La meg møte frykten. La den flomme over og gjennom meg. Og når den har krysset min sti vil jeg la mitt indre øye vende seg mot dens spor. Hvor frykten har trådt er det intet. Bare jeg består.**

**commencement**

**""Jeg må ikke være redd. Redsel er den lille døden, som tilintetgjør alt. Jeg skal se redselen i hvitøyet. Jeg skal tillate den å svøpe over og igjennom meg.

Now I'm finally doing it, even if it took me a bit longer than I had thought. (A couple of years more.. that's ok..) And I never, ever, imagined I'd have ended up going to Norway. 

It's something I decided a few months ago just when I finally made the application. Thinking: why not? It could be cool.

Yeah, that's how I take big decisions in my life: I like it freestyle.

But now that I've been researching a bit norwegian culture and the norwegian language, I'm really really happy with my decision: norsk is awesome, I can't wait to study it properly. Why the hell did grieg write songs in german?! His songs in norwegian are way, way better.

And from what I read, norwegian people seem to be quite nice (and the ones I've interacted with during my application for sure are :D ) and proud of their culture. Something that I really like because I firmly believe that a person has to be proud of who he is, and his culture its part of this. 

And this has nothing to do with scorning other countries' cultures.

Anyway, I'm going to Tromsø for 10 months in a couple of weeks and I've already figured out what to do, etc (and this sub has been useful in this regard!)

I just wanted to tell you that I really like what I've been reading about your country and that your language it's awesome. 

I'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun living there for a while: I love living in foreign countries and yours seems really promising :D

Cheers!

My wife and I recently found out we are pregnant (after a few years of trying we are very excited about this).

However, she is not currently working and therefore (naturally) will not receive any maternity leave.

I am working.  However, from what I read on NAV.no I do not get any paternity leave.

Essentially, if the mother is working then she **DOES** get maternity leave. However, if the father is working he **DOES NOT** get paternity leave **UNLESS** the mother is also working.

This seems quite sexist.  Why should my leave have anything to do with her and just the same for her!

I wonder if I misunderstood the way benefits work... or if it really is that I get zero paid time off to spend with my child when he/she arrives merely because my wife does not work right now.

They are serving us ""traditional"" Norwegian food, and even though I am a vegetarian, they are making reasonable substitutes for me and the other vegetarian students. The problem is that since I arrived on June 23rd, I haven't had solid stools. Additionally, I don't ever feel satisfied. I leave a meal and still feel hungry even though I take large portions and finish them off! 

Breakfasts are cereal, bread and cheese, etc. Lunches for vegetarians are usually salads or something else light. Usually no protein. And dinners are potatoes, some sort of vegetable, and something random like rice or a fried patty of carrots for the vegetarians.

Back home my diet was mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, pasta, bread, soy products for protein, and lots of dairy. Didn't hardly ever eat out and had a very low fat diet with very few processed foods. Nothing too different from here! Except that I'm eating far less fruit here. 

What gives? Why am I having gastrointestinal issues? Why aren't meals satisfying? Any other visitors or immigrants from America having or have had these same issues? What did you do to feel better?

1362028366.0	19donv	Takk skal du ha. Use it for thanks, use it for sarcasm.	Orchidhead	26	11	14	"The Norsk phrase *Takk skal du ha.* is roughly translated to English as being only a 'thank you'. 
But let us consider it's more realistic meanings. 

Firstly, the phrase can be used in every day conversation, but it's a bit more formal than ""Tusen takk"", and I would say ""Takk skal du ha."" when thanking someone in a shop for helping me, to someone who gave me an unexpected or large gift, or anything else that would call for many big thanks. 

The scary thing with “takk skal du ha” is that if said at a point where it is not obvious that the person helped you, it can be perceived as sarcasm. As in “Her litt jobb til deg. - Å, takk skal du ha.” (”Here some work for you to do. - Oh, wow thanks!” (sarcastic))

Second: Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask and sorry for the long post, but have nowhere else to ask: 

A: In the aftermath of the shooting Utoeya and the bombing(s) in Oslo; do you think the government will make an effort to give guns to police or will they establish stricter gun laws?

B: Did the government monitor the right-wing groups in Norway? Are they very big or dangerous (extremest hate groups)? Since the government is quite liberal there, do you think the government will start monitoring/outlawing right-wing groups now?

Thank you in advance for any insight. I live in Washington, United States, but have family in Norway (Stavanger I think).

**EDIT #2**  *Thank you all for your contributions. This week I will begin the sketching process of thumbnailing out how I want these images to look. I have to pic four aspects of your culture then do 10 sketches of each. I want to communicate your culture as accurately and clearly as I can. I will be posting my sketches in this thread(or a new one, I don't want to spam your board) later this week, and would love your comments on them. Thank you once again and feel free to keep contributing.*

I'm doing a project for my illustration class where we pick a culture group, then we get to make a series of postage stamps out of them! The idea is about the celebration of cultural integration. 

I'd like to get more personal insight into your culture so if anyone wouldn't mind answering a few question for me that would be great! 

I'll be glad to post the final results when that time comes!

Here's some questions if anyone is interested:

What taboos of your culture?
What are some of the normal, everday, foods and how do they play an important cultural role?
How does music/dance fit into your culture?
What are some of the main sports? What are some of the more rural sports?
How does viking heritage play a role in your culture?
What are some forms of folk art?

I'm really drawn to the wood pattern carvings. Do they represent certain things?

I also really like the depiction of serpent heads on the viking boats. Do they have any kind of cultural role?


If you have anything else to add that would help me out that would be great. 

Thank you so much and I hope to one day visit your beautiful country!

1295811078.0	f7mr6	Norwegian Redditors, what is the political climate in Norway like right now?	proton5000	17	0	57	"Hello everyone, I'm an American and I was just curious about Norway's politics right now. This is a very broad question, however, so I will elaborate with more specific questions.

Which political parties/movements are becoming more popular in recent years?

What do YOU think about the current government and prime minister in Norway and and why do you think this way?

What is your prediction for the results of the next election in Norway?

If you could change one thing about your government, what would it be?

What is your stance on the environment and global warming?


You all might be wondering why I'm interested in this kind of stuff. 

Well, about a year or so ago, I really began to become fed up with the politics in the United States. People don't care about each other, only themselves. Many of my fellow Americans equate things universal healthcare with evil, they think global warming is a scam, etc. and it really frustrates me. Society in general is just completely apathetic about social problems.
tl;dr - I'm disillusioned with the way the masses think in America.

Then I started reading about Norway and how it has a really nice system of government (in my opinion) where people truly care about each other and no one is cast aside. Although there are a lot higher taxes on most things and the government generally has a larger role in things than in the U.S., I don't think this is a necessarily bad thing. I also applaud that the government seems to truly care about the environment.

Thanks for bearing with me since this is a really long post. I appreciate all feedback :)

I am a German PhD student currently visiting Tromsø to run some experiments that are central to my PhD project. I investigate sentence processing in Norwegian as a native and a foreign language. So far, I have collected data of Germans learning Norwegian, but now I need you, Norwegian native speakers for comparison.

The experiment can, unfortunately, not be done over the internet, so I need people from Tromsø. My German participants took usually between 45-60 minutes, so native speakers should be done within 30-45 minutes. And yes, you also get a small reimbursement for your participation (and in the end there will be a bigger prize for one of the participants). Altogether, I need at least 32 people. So, even if you cannot take part yourself, because you live in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim or any other beautiful city far away, please forward this to anyone you know up here.

Here are the facts summed up:
Who: Norwegian native speakers (no other language acquired from **birth or in early childhood**, languages learned later in school don't matter), over 18 to be able to sign a consent form
Where: at UiT (or a comparably quiet place in Tromsø where I can plug in my computer)
When: Aug 12 - Sep 2, the exact time and date can be chosen by yourself
What: reading sentences on a computer screen and filling out 2 questionnaires
How long: ca. 45 minutes

1. I decided to learn to speak Stavanger dialect (or maybe Jæren... I'll end up with a hybrid of some sort probably). What do you think about expats speaking a regional dialect? I thought it would be nice to have some sort of connection to the local community. And I think I will mess with people heads telling them with the french ""r"" ""Eg snakker ikkje norsk"", which I pronounce ""surprisingly well"" as I was told by one local Norwegian. ;)

2. My learning technique is also strange. I hate to learn from a textbook, I hate to learn grammar. So I use Kaizers Orchestra. Great music - was listening to them for few years before I moved - and the dialect is there. I take Norwegian lyrics, English lyrics, print side by side. I learn what all the phrases mean. Listen, sing along. That way I can practice Norwegian just by listening to music and learning the lyrics. I'll use some textbooks to have an organized view of the grammar, sure, but 95% it's listening, reading and signing. I wonder if it will work...

1312918557.0	jdso3	Something I have noticed about Norwegians speaking/writing English. (Has/have)	enthius	15	1	34	"First of all, allow me to add the following disclaimer: Norwegians are awesome at languages. They have some of the best accent I have heard, and many people often speak other languages other than Norwegian and English. It is not uncommon for me to find people that speak Italian and Spanish, and even from a young age, Norwegian-English is awesome. I had to learn English myself, and I consider my English to be of an inferior standard to most scandinavians, which is why I find this issue so confusing.

But there is a mistake that I have found to be prevalent in nearly everyone, and it surprises me that people that can elaborate really complicated enunciates and speeches have trouble with this, even after living many years abroad. I am talking about using **""have and has""** in the wrong place. Now if it just a person, I wouldn't say anything, but it seems like a generalised error that probably lies within the structure of the Norwegian language. 

**Examples**: ""All of us has to stop doing this"" Or ""The people in London has reacted with optimism""

Why am I saying this? because after I mentioned it to my Norwegian wife, she started noticing it, and changed it, so my theory is that most Norwegians make the mistake because they simply don't notice, so I am hoping that this will help someone out there to turn their English from great to awesome.

If some linguist has an answer about why this happens, it would be interested to hear!

**TL;DR** Norwegians speak perfect English, but I noticed that they usually make the very simple mistake of confusing *has* with *have*, and I find it weird, considering how good their level of English is.

Can you get any prescription/procedure that is medically necessary as determined by your doctor? 


Edit:
I really appreciate your comments, I'm doing research on different healthcare systems and wanted some answers from the people actually there. You would really have no idea how healthcare is in America from just reading a policy so This was very useful.

We've (my family and i) been in Norway since the 10th at 11 am and we are having a GREAT time.  We were in Oslo the 10th, 11th and 12th in the morning. At 11.30 am we left driving off to Bergen. We were planning to go to Flåm but E16 was closed so we had to do a big detour via Gol and Sogndal, because if we went to Flåm we would had to return to Lærdal to road 5 again. At Sogndal we left on direction to Hella but there was an accident on a tunnel (i think even a person died...sad :( ) and someone told us to go via Førde and take the ferry in Lavik. We did all that and finally arrived to Bergen at 11 pm. 12 fucking hours in the car BUT it was one of the best road trips i've ever made. I loved the nature and the road. I love the Sogn og Fjordane.  I don't have words to describe it. I'll stay the 13th on Bergen and leave the 14th. Tomorrow we will walk in Bryggen and Torget and Nordnes. Is there anything else that we MUST go and know here in Bergen?  We are going to Kristiansand but we dont know what to do next, if go down via Stavanger or as /u/VikingTravels said, go down via Lysebotn? 

Also, as everything is so expensive,  can you give us tips to stretch every krone? We've been told that the Rema is the cheapest market.

And two more things: in the road we saw a lot of black and white ads(¿?) But we didn't know what they were about. One of them says Hugs Bilbelte (or smthn like that). Later i'll upload a pic of one. And there was a radio ad that was kind of folk music and ended with a woo! Or something. I'll upload a recording of it too.

I think that is it for now. I'll update this post later. Thanks for everything, Norway! "	t5_2qwrb	True

June. 21 days (20 accounted for including travel).
Iceland - Norway - Germany - Denmark.

1. Fly from San Francisco to Iceland for a few days to enjoy the natural springs. Stay for about 4 days. (cheap flight ~ $623 each)
2. Fly to Bergen. (cheap flight ~ $150 each)
3. See some fjords (Sognefjord, Hardangerfjord, etc etc)
4. Travel to Oslo by train/boat(maybe this involves step 3?) Stay for about 6-7 days between Oslo, Bergen, and fjords.
5. Oslo down to Germany by train (~16 hours). Stay for about 6 days.
6. Train back to Copenhagen for 2 days and then fly out. (cheapest flight in the area: $815 each)

Ideally I come here asking about the best way to see the fjords, but if you have further advice please share it. Options that I've read about would be cruises or bus tours. We'd prefer avoiding renting a car I think.

Denmark is not necessary, but should be fun. We chose it due to it being 1/2 the price to fly back compared to Switzerland/Czech. If you know of cheaper/better options please do share.

Also: We're planning on moving to Oslo, Norway hopefully later this year so we'll be in the region which will allow for easier travel.

I am a (to be) second year college student getting a Bachelors Degree (4 year) for Web Development. 

I had heard from a few people on here that it is virtually impossible to move to Norway by attaining a working permit / green card unless you marry a Norwegian or have a PhD or Masters. I found this unsettling as you can imagine.

Web Dev programming and coding languages are all in English and standard symbols and numbers so I figured that benefited me greatly - however, you generally don't get a PhD or Masters in this field.

My plan was to finish college, get a job, save up for two years as much as I can as I won't have to pay bills except for food, and a bit of rent to my mother. We talked about it, and I would basically be bringing 18 months worth of pay to cover me. When I moved to Norway of course, I would have already secured a job, with my 18 months of pay as a safety blanket.

I do intend to learn the language by the way, English is similar and borrows from it a bit amongst other languages so it should prove easy should I give it enough time.

Is it truly near impossible for me?

I came here because every other subreddit I've found that could fit as well seems to be less populated (a bit like /r/lanl_french). Sorry if I'm completely wrong.

Basically, I want to learn a third language and I'm kind of interested in Norwegian. Norway and Norwegian are things that always caught my attention and I always wanted to learn another Germanic language.

The problem is that I don't know where to start. It's pretty easy to find stuff about more common languages like French or Spanish but it seems like there isn't a lot for Norwegian and nobody seems to know if the stuff one finds is actually worth it. 

So I'd like to ask you if you can recommend something that could get me started (or maybe more).

There might be a lot of natives here but I hope that maybe somebody immigrated to Norway and had to learn the language or maybe somebody had to answer this question before (we're after all on the internet).

The different parties hardly differ from each other in anything important and are left to attempt to differentiate with demagogic promises (valgflesk). Furthermore, the relatively peaceful and affluent conditions in the Nordic countries contributes to making the elections into a game with very low stakes. The homogeneity between the parties coupled with the perception of the vote as a low impact decision leads to apathy in the voter community. There is little real emotion or motivation beyond niche cases and populistic agendas. 

There are several underlying factors that contribute to this state of Nordic politics, one of the primary reasons that will be discussed here are the short election terms (4 years). The short time constraints between elections make it difficult for leaders to construct long term agendas for their communities on any sort of meaningful scale. This is a problem in particular for a region that enjoys peaceful and prosperous conditions since there is little motivation in the voter base and thus in the political class to form greater agendas and plans than are required to reach the re-election. Thus a prosperous nation reaches a plateau of social growth, where four years is to short to plan and implement meaningful social and political change without risking 
the re-election or even making actively harmful reforms. 

How can we solve this problem? We need to build room in our political process for long term vision and both national and global Strategic Planning. A possible solution proposed here is to split the responsibility of running the nation between 4 years and 
20 year governments. The number 20 is in this case completely made up for the purposes of discussion, the optimal length of the term should be informed by research. In this political system the 20 year government would be in charge of planning the nations future on the long term and on a grand scale. Addressing questions such as climate change, how to secure the country in case
of catastrophic resource scarcity, how to balance the private and public spheres of influence and in the case for Norway to formulate a specific long term plans on how to invest the countries temporary oil-based riches into physical, social and 
intellectual infrastructure that can ensure the future prosperity of our region. 

The goal is to ensure forward momentum in times of prosperity, to plan for future crisis and to set an agenda for the country, something that none of the current Norwegian political parties are able to do because of the short election cycle. In a world that is becoming rapidly more globalized, the ability to incorporate long term planning in national politics is becoming increasingly necessary. The benefits of long term planning on this scale can be witnessed clearly in the meteoric rise of 
the Chinese economy where this type of planning has been used to great effect. 

The system that is being proposed here is in a way a hybridization of the Chi-com way of governance with the established western democratic system. Neither is perfect but both have strong elements that can be combined to a unique effect. 

As imagined here, a 20 year government would be responsible for the long term planning while 4 year governments would function more or less like they do today, being mostly preoccupied with year to year budget managing and the concrete implementation of the plans formulated by the 20 year government. How this system should be balanced in terms of power is not clear at the moment. There are obvious dangers to giving too much power to a government that sits in power for 20 years. Corruption, mismanagement or incompetence are much harder to combat and can be much more harmful to society if allowed to work at this scale. However, the 20 year government need some amount of power in order to not become merely a figure head position with no real political influence. 

One thing that seems clear to me is that the decision making withing the 20 year government should be based on sociological, anthropological and psychological research. Not only as a literary source but in an active way to formulate and most importantly test political hypotheses before implementing them on a national scale. The 20 year government should be a place where opinions must be backed up by facts and facts must be backed up by observation. How exactly to implement this is a larger question but it is time we adopt science in government as rigorously as we do in medicine and engineering. 

There are many questions that remain difficult to answer but it seems at least clear to me that the current western democratic 
system of 4 year governments are becoming absolute, and that this will become increasingly obvious as it faces competition
from other emerging political systems on the world stage, both in the public and private sectors. Simultaneously, the Norwegian society needs something to shake us from the prosperity induced torpor we are currently in where there is no room for grand visions, strategy or plans beyond the next election cycle.

It just so happens that those roots go back to Norway.  Below I have posted images of a letter that she found from the turn of the century when my Norwegian relatives had moved to the US.  The letter is (we think) from their family in Norway.  If any of you kind folk could take a crack at translation, it'd be greatly, greatly appreciated.  Also, I have to admit the more I think about it the more interested I am in finding out what the letter says as well.

1354593539.0	148ruq	Hi everyone! I have a couple cultural questions I was hoping you might answer for me.	goodwolf	13	2	32	"First thing I was wondering about is Norwegian sense of humour. I'm a New Zealander so here it's similar to British in being self deprecating but with a mix of being vicious in a personal way (making people rage is funny). Also, lotta swearing (the more superfluous the better). So how would you describe Norwegian humour (stand up/messing about with your friends/whatever else)?

Second thing I'm curious about is sexuality. This because I'm a little confused in that I've had contrasting impressions from different people. I have an online Norwegian friend who is openly bisexual to himself and me but he's expressed that he doesn't ever want to come out in his personal life - he doesn't want anyone to know. I've had some Norwegians tell me it's fine and no one honestly cares but he (he live in Oslo in case the region is relevant) sure doesn't want to. He never told me precisely why.

Tangentially related to that, I'm also bi and I was wondering how common it might be for Norwegian women to have a problem with that - It's not an uncommon deal breaker in NZ unfortunately.

The last thing is about motoring. Kiwis are pretty fond of their cars and I'm no exception. Does Norway have much of a car cultural at all? Anything like your neighbour Finland (who have a reputation for producing the greatest race drivers in the world)? I wondered if the oil industry you have fosters such a thing."	t5_2qwrb	True

The article claims that during the beginning of this summer, it was deemed that the state budget surplus would be problematic to the krone. As such, the ruling party proposed that income taxes for the second half of 2012 would be refunded or not collected (the article does not specify), and that the Norwegian left (huh?) proposed that taxes that would be normally collected be allocated instead as a ""gift"" to a country facing significant issues. The Norwegian government put the issue to a referendum, in which 72% of voters opted for taxes to be collected normally.

After a lot of Googling and searching various news sites, I can not find any references to either said referendum or the choice of action Norway opted for (funding hospitals in Vietnam). If you could either point me to sources for these events or actually disprove them, I would be most grateful!

PS. If my google-fu is weak, I apologize in advance. :-)

* As I mentioned earlier, I have an EU passport. I've heard being American gives me little chance in hell to get permanent residency, etc. Does being an EU citizen help this problem at all?

* I plan to study in the U.S. (or maybe U.K.). I will probably be studying engineering (another plus, apparently) and hope to get a master's (maybe PhD) at a selective school. I consider myself an intelligent person as far as education is concerned.

* I am aware of the financial implications of living in Norway.

My main question here is basically this: what would I need to do over the course of the next 10 years (give or take) so I have the opportunity to live a happy life in Norway? 

I'd appreciate some serious input or response from someone who can help me out here. I also realize that 10 years is a long time, so things may change or it might not even be possible to give me advice.

*This will probabely give me a D-number and after a few months a work permit (Do I as a EU citizen need one actually?). This will also allow me to stay [up to 6 months][EUWorkVisa] instead of 3.*  
Also request a tax card (Skattekort) here.

2. Open a bank account in a Norwegian bank so the employer has a place to send the money to.  
*Requires D-number.*

3. Look for a job myself.  
*Don't wait for the NAV or any other interim to find a job for me*

4. Look for an appartment.  
*Or do this before looking for a job? See other questions below*

**After finding a job**  

1. Request a [residence permit][EUWorkVisa] (last few paragraphs) in order to be allowed to stay longer than 6 months.

**After 5 years of working and if I want to stay permanently**

1. Request a [permanent residence permit][permanentResidencePermit]

   
   
**Other questions**

+ Do I need to have a permanent address before I can start looking for a job, or is it okay to stay with someone (eg. couchsurfing)?  
+ What is the time between requesting a D-number and being able to use it (look for a job, open a bank account), and can I start this process from Belgium in order to minimize wasting time?  
+ Requesting a work permit can take a [long time][workPermitWaitTime] I've read, but there also exists a temporary work permit. What would be the waiting time for that?
+ Does an interim job qualify as a job offer when requesting a [residence permit][EUWorkVisa]?
Related to this: is it possible to hop from interim job to interim job and keep your residence permit?
+ Anything else that you think that might be useful - let me know :)  
Also, if you know some web/software development businesses in/around Stavanger, that would be very helpful.


**Extra info**  

+ I have a College bachelors diploma in Applied Computer Science but not much working experience in software development (2 months internship, 1 month vacation job and after this summer another month of vacation work.)

I'd like to start watching Norwegian-language films as well to inject some entertainment and cultural understanding into the program, and am hoping r/norway can recommend some good ones.

My plan is to watch each film several times: first with English subtitles, then with Norwegian subtitles, and then without subtitles at all--to understanding the context first, and then to pick up the language around it.

The only movie I've seen so far is Hodejegerne.  I certainly enjoyed it the first time, but there are also a fair number of scenes that are difficult to watch.  My ideal film would be something well-suited for repeat viewing, i.e. without a ton of gore or Lars von Trier-style psychodrama.  I'm planning on tracking down Max Manus and Trolljegerne next, but any other pointers would be appreciated.

I reference it whenever I get in to an in depth conversation about the Norwegian spirit and the robust connection to the outdoors. (These conversations happily happen every now and then.) 

But I can't find the film. Not online, not in a North American DVD format. Since I haven't been able to pass along this film to the people I've mentioned it to, I'm sure they now think that I've made it up to conveniently illustrate my points in conversation.

I've contacted the director, Sjur Paulsen, directly about buying a copy, and he regretfully said there aren't any available in the North American DVD format. 

Can anyone help? Does anyone own it in a format that they could make watchable for me? 

For anyone who's interested, the trailer is available in Norwegian [here](http://www.filmenloop.no/page.php?p=129&amp;c=56&amp;language=en), and the Norwegian Film Institute summarizes it as follows: 
Loop is a full-length documentary film investigating modern people’s relationship with time, seen through the eyes of some of our time’s rather extreme consumers. The people we meet have each in their own way made drastic decisions concerning their life situations. A 41 year old extreme sport practitioner with ambitions to climb a spectacular mountain, then throw himself off the mountain in a base jump. Two part-time fishermen and skiing enthusiasts who are getting tired of urban life in Narvik go on an immensely long journey in their rowing boat to go skiing under ultimate conditions on one of the unique islands of Lofoten. An ambulance driver and former UN rep in Lebanon and Bosnia takes a break from his extremely hectic life to sit alone in a tower in the middle of a forest in Østfold county, where his only assignment is to scout with binoculars for four months and make sure the forest doesn’t catch fire. At the end of a long journey, the 92 year old philosopher Arne Næss Senior looks back at the decisions he made and the decisions he did not make."	t5_2qwrb	True

Anything I should be aware?	enthius	14	4	23	"Some background: I have been to Norway many times, and my wife is form there, I even speak quite a bit of Norwegian. I have worked in Norway, but I was never on a ""business setting"" because I didn't quite speak the language then.

 I am going there on holidays and my company thought it would be a good idea to set up some meetings with potential business partners.

I just wanted some insights on how I should behave when in a business situation in Norway, as I have never been in it.

I usually check this website: http://www.cyborlink.com/besite/european_union.htm which mainly has analysis of different countries based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions, but there's nothing on Norway.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: I went to the meeting and the advice here was very valuable! their office was right downtown Oslo, very near from where the bombs exploded, and the people there were very nice. I was surprised about how open they were when talking about their business, since I am used to people being a bit more secretive. I think we nailed it and the meeting was successful

1302721267.0	gp9zg	Traveling to Tromsø in June, any tips on what to see and do?	pbforster	11	1	31	"Hi


Myself and a couple of friends are traveling to Tromsø in June and are looking to put together a rough itinerary. We're mainly heading up for the marathon on the Saturday evening, however also keen to look around the surrounding area. We'll be there for six nights - arriving on the Friday afternoon, departing on the following Thursday morning.


We figure that we could have a look around the city and see the usual sights on the Friday evening / Saturday (Arctic Cathedral, Mack Brewery, Museum, Polaria etc - I'm assuming they're all open on weekends).


On the Sunday, after a bit of a sleep in, thinking we could hire a car and go for a drive, either east out towards Lyngen, or head west around Kvaløya (or we could hire the car for two days - either way, won't be up for a lot of walking on the Sunday or Monday). 


We then have three more days in Tromsø to fill in. Depending on how our legs are, I'd like to walk up Tromsdalstinden. 


Have read a little bit about Svalbard, but not sure it's worth heading out there given the flights land / depart at 1400 / 1445 so can't really do a day tour unless we stay for two days... Apart from being further north than most people on the planet, is Svalbard worth visiting?


So just wondering if anyone has any recommendations for / against what we're thinking about doing, if there are some better alternatives to what's above, or suggestions for things we've missed.


Thanks for your input :)"	t5_2qwrb	True

so, recently I've been a little bit obsessed about this little idea - to find some web developing projects in Norway which I could develop from home. The scheme I have in mind is fairly simple: since beer is 5 times cheaper in my country, I could work for less and still earn a little bit more, than I could here. The bigest problem I see is that I don't know the language yet and inability to find more information brings me to this subreddit. I have some friends in Norway, but they're not tech savvy enough to provide answers about web development.

Why Norway you ask? Well, I've visited my friends in Bergen this summer and that was the best week in foreign country ever - I'm thinking about visiting it more or even moving to live to Norway some time in future, but before that it would be great to establish some work-related relationships and save up some money.

* is it possible to find what I'm looking for or are there huge barriers I don't know about?
* could you describe web development market in Norway in general? Is there a demand for web programmers?
* what are average prices for a simple representational (""home"", ""about company"", ""contacts"") website with simple tidy design (unfortunately I'm not a designer, but I could find people for that)?
* how much tax system would hurt me and client in this case?
* how much Norwegian web makers would hate me for ""stealing"" some projects from them? I'm that kind of person, who is bothered by this point a lot, despite the utopian idea, that those web developers could hire me and in this case - everybody wins.
* do you have a job for me? :)


Any other thoughts? Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions or ideas. And sorry for my English this morning - I'm still sleeping.

Edit: I can also develop iPhone/Android applications, if that could help my case."	t5_2qwrb	True

Next week I'm coming to Oslo for a few days and I'd like to ask a few questions. I've never been in Norway and a guide book I have is probably outdated. Also different on-line guides says different things on some subjects.

1. Can I buy a prepaid SIM card with some internet access as a visitor, or are these only sold with plan (like in Sweden)? My data roaming plan kinda sucks.
2. Is internet tethering (cellphone as a hotspot) working normally with Norwegian phone operators?
3. How long does a bus trip take from Sandefjord Airport to Oslo?
4. How much NOK will buy me a nice day? I mean some good restaurant, maybe some tourist place, couple of beers in a decent bar/pub, anything else worth seeing.
5. Which hotel to choose in Oslo? I'd appreciate a nice view and NEED to have a decent internet access (hotel wifi with not only www working...); also A/C would be appreciated, but I don't want to pay more than €150 a day.
6. Can I use euros or US dollars or do I have to grab a fair amount of Norwegian krones (kroners?)?
7. What should I be afraid of about people I meet? Any tips about local scams?
8. Any places I should NOT visit?
9. Is it easy to get robbed on a bright day? Also is it safe to to walk in Oslo at nights?
10. Can I ride a bike without any driver's licence?

I am very active in my students' union in the UK. I was a Sabbatical Officer for my local Union during the last year and involved in the HE committee for the National Union of Students, plus working with helping at other unions across the country.

I tried looking at how things work in Norway, but it all looks a bit hacky...can anyone tell me their own experience about it? Especially for international students.

There is ""NSO"" or national students organisation (I guess like NUS Norway). They have an international students officer, but the person that does this is NOT an international student (which seems a bit dodgy to me). I e-mailed both president and vice-president of NSO and they haven't bothered to reply.

Then there's ISU or ""International students' Union of Norway"" which is a national org. apparently help with ""welfare issues"" of international students only, separated from the NSO. Their website doesn't look very professional and it is quiet hard to grasp their governance. But hey, they reply e-mails, so that's already better than the other one!

These two have local counterparts at the institutions, but again, they don't have much info and the websites are quite out of date or in Norwegian and can't fully grasp what they say.

1372057959.0	1gyfeo	Thinking about moving to Bergen	BoingBoingPantsu	10	0	8	"Hi there

I'm a ""lost"" norwegian boy thinking about moving home to the motherland and i'm thinking about choosing Bergen as my new home. I currently live in Sweden (skrev post här på engelska eftersom /r/Norge hade krav på norska poster och min norska är riktigt dålig) but i was born in Norway and thus has a norwegian citizenship. The work sittuation in Sweden is not that great and i've heard lots of great things about Norway and then Bergen as they seem to have alot of jobs to offer (i work in it-service) at the moment. I visitet Bergen some years ago for some  17. mai celebration and i fell in love with the city, it seemed very nice from my very breif visit, but before i make a big decision and pack up and move i do have some questions.

* How is the appartment/house sittuation in Bergen? I've taken a look over at [finn.no](http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/lettings/result?areaId=20220) but i find its best to ask the citizens how it is with housing. Student housing is not for me (i'm pushing 30) how is it to live in a hybel? Me and my mom lived like that in the 80's and it was fine, but maybe it's mostly a young man thing?

* Public transportation, is it a big city to get around in? Busses/trams/boats?
* Living costs, i know food and stuff can be pretty expensive in Norway and i'm guessing that Bergen is no exception? I am a ""Ungkar"" (hello ladies) so it's going to be alot of lazy food 
* Language, i do know a bit of norwegian, but i havent spoken it in like 25 years, so to call me rusty would be an understatement. I've heard that bergenser have a very special dialect that can be hard for outsiders to understand. Do they speak nynorsk? If i come to Bergen and speak swedish will i be thrown out of the city or will the friendly inhabitants have patience with me and my poor excuse for norwegian?
* Crime, i live in a very calm part of sweden pretty close to a major city that i seldom visit. How is it with the crime in Bergen? I don't really go clubbin', but if i were to work late one day, could i take the public transportation/walk home without having to always look over my shoulder? You can never be perfectly safe, but if you compare it to moving late at night in Oslo (which i do not like) how does Bergen stand then?
* Internet, how is it with internetspeeds in Bergen? If i take an appartment do most of them have fiber/coax, or is it mostly dsl?

This became a pretty lenghty post, but then again it's a pretty big decision to be made. Maybe Bergen is not for me, maybe it is, but in my heart i really miss norway and Bergen seemed to be such a nice place to live."	t5_2qwrb	True

I've started to learn Norwegian and it seems to be going quite well. The problem I've got is that I'm used to write cursive. I'm a lot faster with cursive but it seems like the cursive we learn in Germany just doesn't work with the æ. Æ (still different from A and E in the cursive I use) works quite well but æ just doesn't look right.

Also, my O is just too small. The ø just looks like one drop of ink. 

So, how do you write cursive? Am I just not used to it and therefore need some time until my writing looks like proper and clean or do you use another type of cursive?

http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:La-ges.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060501153550

That's what I've learnt in school and I pretty much stick to it except some capital letters (L and S specifically). The æ in print can be done with one smooth movement but the a and e right next to each other with that type of cursive just looks weird.

å and Å are no problem, obviously.

I did some searching and it looks like din means yours, so my family thought something like yours truly or yours always but I can't find any clear translation for those that contain din. It's from one loved one to another, so would anyone have any good guesses as to what it would be?

**update** So I learned more about where the ring came from and we also went to a jeweler to get a close look at it. The jeweler believed it said ""Gustaf"" but I didn't see where he was getting the staf part from, because that last letter definitely appears to be a d to me. The ring was from my father's great great uncle. We still don't know whether it was passed down from someone else before him, or if he made it for a wife, or was his wife's. It was given to me by my great ~~great~~ grandmother, but it wasn't for her, rather just passed down to her. We will try and find out what family names there were since it seems to be that most of you believe it was a name. Unfortunately records are shoddy and the only family member who may have any idea is hospitalized right now and unable to dig through his records. Thank you all for the help!!

I'm an American interested in relocating to Norway and have been offered a job here, and I'm very excited to have this opportunity!  However, due to the high cost of living, I'd like to make sure I'm getting as good a deal as I can, so I'd like to ask about what is typical in terms of negotiating compensation with a Norwegian company.

Are there any cultural differences in terms of the recruitment and negotiation process when compared to the US?  It's rather typical for job offers in the US to have some back-and-forth discussion about salary, benefits, holiday, stock options, etc., eventually coming to an agreement, or possibly resulting in no deal at all.

I've heard that salaries are somewhat regulated because of strong workers' protections in the law, but I'm not sure if those apply to business and professional positions.  What level of flexibility should I expect?  Are job offers more of a ""take it or leave it"" affair in Norway?

I don't want to commit any social faux-pas in the process that could sink the deal altogether, so I'd appreciate any advice you have here.

Takk!

She was in our kitchen from my childhood home, cooking breakfast. I told her that there was something I wanted to tell her, then I whispered in her ear: ""Jeg elsker deg, bestemor."" (these were the first Norwegian words that I ever spoke to her beside ""takk for maten"" which was the only Norwegian she ever taught me. 

She replied with something that I couldn't understand, to which I frowned and replied ""Jeg forstår ikke."" 

She smiled and gave me big hug and suddenly I was much smaller than her, I'm nearly 2m tall and she was just a little over 1.5m so this was strange to me at first. 

Then she pulled back a little and said ""I'm very proud of you, maxunderkill. Keep studying."" I woke up feeling better than I have in a very long time. 

I've found a great deal of resources for learning the language from this subreddit and from the Norwenglish channel on FB, so I thought I'd take a moment to share this with you all and say thank you.  We really have a great little community here.

Since I am not in Norway yet I am trying to apply for apartments by emailing people through finn.no. I think I have an offer or two, but I want to be careful. I have lost money before (not in norway) because I wasnt careful with contracts and deposits. I have done some googling but was wondering if anyone here had some general advice.

Also, what is the typical process for giving a rental deposit?  I got an email from someone on the finn.no site saying ""If you like to rent I need the deposit in my account as soon as possible"". But I have found one website that says...

""The deposit amount should be deposited in a special deposit account in the tenant's name and the landlord should pay for the deposit account. Putting money in a separate deposit account makes settlement easier after the tenant has moved out. Deposits that are not put in a blocked account are illegal.""

Does anyone know any good modern books to learn Norwegian with, that are written from a scholarly point of view like [old books](http://archive.org/details/grammarofdanonor00sarguoft) were?

We could get jobs anywhere in the US, but Norway is totally foreign to us. My field is web application development (more techy details if you want 'em).

There are some cruises to do (about Fjords), if this is true, can we get seasick on this kind of cruises?

Is it doable with this budget ? is it true that meals are expensive in restaurants (230 - 270 NOK) ? Can we visit the country without doing long hiking (i have a foot disorder which prevents me from walking for more than 3-4 hours in a row) ?

The wether is soft in August or as a french should i bring extra sweaters and blankets ? (especially for my GF who thinks its cold outside below 20°C)

I know i can sound stupid with this kind of question, but i dont know nothing about your country, only heard stuff here and there. And that's also the reason we want to visit it.

Any others information are very appreciated !

Thanks for reading.

I have asked my bank if they charge foreign transacation fees,and they told me that they did not, however that ATMs can charge regardless.

What I would like to know, is the cheapest way of getting around in norway going to be just withdrawing cash from ATMs using my debit card every 3-5 days, or using a credit card and charging it (are there fees for that?)

I am located in the USA.

edit:
Thanks all!

We just booked the ferry Hirsthals &lt;&gt; Kristiansand, seems to me the best of both options. Also the cheapest, the ferry from Kiel to Oslo is 500 euro, 1000 for a return, this option is just under 260 euro's for a return. Money we are rather spending in Norway ;-)

1358270874.0	16ml9u	Finding a job in Norway, from America?	izzlups	10	2	20	"Background: Me (Norwegian), husband (American), child (dual citizen), residing in America (I have a green card), wanting to eventually move to Norway. Husband does not want to go to Norway and gamble on finding a job in his field, as he has no interest in working menial jobs. I, on the other hand, stay at home in America because I'm not qualified for anything but menial jobs, and they wouldn't pay for daycare costs in our area.

What we were thinking is this: Husband keeps an eye on the job ads in Norway, applies, and hopes to get a job offer; then we pack up and go. Husband does not yet speak Norwegian, but will take online Norwegian classes through the U of North Dakota in the fall (only Norwegian classes we could find). We don't have a time limit, so if this takes a year or ten years, that's fine (though for me personally, sooner is better). How feasible is this? Would a company be willing to wait for my husband to make the move before having him start? (He's in Accounting and Finance, by the way.)

Has anyone brought an American spouse to Norway, or moved to Norway and can tell me a bit about the process? (I know we don't qualify for Familieinnvandring because I don't meet, and have no chance of meeting, the income requirement.)"	t5_2qwrb	True

Given the recent political happenings, I have fears of how my country may grow in the coming years. With religion becoming more and more involved in our political system, I believe it is time for me and my girlfriend to leave this place as soon as possible. I only have a few questions.

1. The biggest issue I see with moving to different country is the language barrier. I fear that I will not be able to communicate with most people. Is English widely accepted in Norway, or should I postpone my moving until I learn the local language?

2. How easy would it be for a man with a bachelors in Psychology to get a job? What jobs are available? Would I be able to continue my current  degree, or would I have to restart? (I'm willing to do so. To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to love the idea of Norway so much that I'd be willing to do almost anything as long as I would be able to speak with other people.)

3. Are there any cultural differences I will face? I don't want to make a man angry because I didn't understand the customs.

4. Are there any differences in laws that I may have to get used to?

5. I understand it is very cold, but are the summers slightly warmer or is it very cold all year? (I enjoy the cold of winter, so the cold wont be an issue.)

What are some generalizations that you can give me?

* Do (Norwegian) interviewers like people presenting themselves as ambitious and competitive or is it more important to show that you want to fit in and go with the current?

* Is humor + a dash of self-deprecation appreciated or is that interpreted as unprofessional?

* All interviewers love it when you ask questions, but should these be of the meaningful/probing sort or just polite fluff questions?

* When is it appropriate to state that you want to be paid on the upper-end of the scale that was presented in the job announcement?

* Any other advice also appreciated.
