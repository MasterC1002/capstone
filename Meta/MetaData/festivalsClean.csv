I was toward the back middle of the Ranch area during and after Thievery Corporation. About 5 minutes after their show ended, some asshole lit a firework off. It malfunctioned and exploded on the ground. The sparks and smoke hit people all around. About 3 seconds after the explosion I was SLAMMED in the head some a piece of debris. Immediately it started bleeding. I went to the First Aid unit and they checked me out. I had a solid puncture wound. It bled for about an hour.

I heard about countless people getting burns and other injuries from these. If anyone is going to any other festes this year, please DON'T bring fireworks and DO yell at people lighting them off."	t5_2re9k	True

  Last summer, the best thing my group of friends made was hobo dinners. Essentially you throw potatoes, your meat of choice, and a bunch of veggies and spices into a (heavy duty) foil boat. The throw that bitch in the fire for a while. You got a super hearty, awesome meal to nourish yourself-so you can rage all night. 

[Here is one of our boats before going in the fire](http://i.imgur.com/2YyKcxL) We made like 3.

[Here it is fresh out of the fire](http://i.imgur.com/XrVvvNG)

In theory you could also do something where it checks in location every so often and if two users are near each other a sound plays.

I don't think this would be very difficult to make, I'd be happy to do it if people would find it useful/fun, but if not then I won't bother.

Edit: I'd be happy to work with an android developer too, I just say iPhone because that is what I'm more familiar with.

Edit 2: Ok so I'm encouraged so far with this many up votes so far, I suppose I'll start preliminary planning."	t5_2re9k	True

A burn party is when the host builds up a log cabin in the middle of the woods or by a beach, when the guests arrive, we have objects to put inside the cabin or on the outside walls, once the moon is high in the sky, we all make a speech on our items and why we brought them. the cabin is soaked with flammable liquid, and everyone throws a match onto the cabin at once, we party the night away until the next day. This celebration is when I clense myself of the past and move on, tonight I burn a photo and a journal full of things I use to write about myself from when I was depressed, I can't wait to rid myself of these memories, to rid myself of these omens.	t5_2re9k	True

Long story in comments	morganisawesome	33	11	7	"Hey there r/festivals, this might be a long story, but if you're about the festival scene, I hope this both warms your heart and inspires you to give maybe a small fuck about my situation. It all takes place Aug 9 at the Summer Set Music festival in Somerset, WI. 

Also, Im going to describe my mental states throughout because Im not exactly sure of the details myself. You dont have to read it all, its pretty long, but it helped me to write it down and I hope its entertaining at least.

My friends and I got to the festival at about 5 o'clock with just enough time to catch the end of Beats Antique. We set up camp, met our cool neighbors, and set about getting fucked up before Figure at 6:30. We had planned to start a trip later in the night so we'd be peaking for the GUC afterparty, but I met a couple people who wanted to start sooner and decided I'd change trippin teams to make some new friends. We got fun with some fungi and got to the stage around 700, with figure picking up the pace and people going crazy. 

Seriously, would recommend figure shows to all dnb kids. He tore shit up and dropped some mean tracks.

 As soon as we got in, my new buddies and I were rage mode, we dove into the crowd and rocked our faces off. To anyone who went, I was the tall kid with grey/ blue baja who kept ending up half naked at the end of shows. 20 min in, I squeeze out for a water and mj break and meet some cool people at the back of the tent. 

(mad shout out to anybody from the show who reads this, you know who you are, and you rock)

Started dancing with some ladies and got lost for a minute, when I looked around for my friends I saw this kid standing by one of the tent supports. He was clearly tripping balls so I walked up to offer water and weed. but

This kid.

This kid you guys. 

There was nothing in his eyes. His irises werent visible.  He wasnt even responding to all the information he was given, i was watching him get over loaded. Walked up and tried to get on his level, I tried to get his name, what he was on, or where his friends were. He tried, he tried his damnest, but it was all just too much for him. He was watching everything happen around him at once at the entirety of it was keeping him from driving his own actions. He couldn't even drink.

Now, I've had my experiences, i've gotten out of it, but this was scary.

I cant get this kid's fucking stare out of my head.

I pulled him away from the support he was tripping over and called my friends and some people around to ask if anyone knew him. Nobody could say, and I still couldnt get him to give us any info. Then shit started getting hazey.

Now, I like to help people, and I clearly wasnt just going to leave this kid in space. But I was also tripping my balls off and figure was STILL burning the place to the ground. The group who was helping him and myself got a distracted when he started getting his footing and could hold himself up and the bass whomped along. 

I dont remember exactly what happened, but I was dancing with some girl and I heard somebody gasp. Tripping me, trying to both rock and care for this kid, knew it was him. Separate and spin just in time to see him falling away from some guy and over the support. This guy christian (cool fuckin dude) and I caught him before he fell, but he was already off his feet. He just kept falling and I took his weight onto my ass (i was already half naked, sweaty, and muddy, christian was relatively clean). The fall scared him more, and he did the trippy thing where you check your pockets for all your shit. Hes still sitting up against me, so i take his backback off and start putting all this stuff in it, making sure he sees it all. I grab his phone from one pocket and reach into his other and my hand touches a glass dropper.

Fuck. 

We'd had theories about what he was on, some people said k hole, others said he was speeding. I still cant decide if it was liquid L or some rc's, but what ever it was, it was all in his pocket and I think it was still getting to him. 

We're both on the ground now and (like festies) people start coming up trying to vibe him back to reality. The first guy has a kdana on and just keeps saying ""good vibes"" to his face while waving his arms around. I'm not gonna say that I dont apprec the help, but the kid just got more scared and started to back up into me away from the people around us. 

All i could think to do was hold this kid in a manhug and tell him im also frying face and that we can do this. He looked at me, and I know he saw me. He tried so hard to get words to me, but his lips just quivered and he groaned. I looked into his eyes and rubbed his sweaty head and he leaned into my shoulder as some guy with a light stick tried to give him a show. 

Reminder, this entire time, Im wearing nothing but a pair of short shorts and a hat, covered in dust, with figure taking everyone to ear climax over and over behind us. Not really important, but its kind of a funny picture.

At some point (730 i think) adventure club took the stage and people just went wilder. It was loud, with people only screaming louder; hot and more and more people packing body heat in; and also starting to look like a war tribe gathering with all the thrashing.

I started to see that this kid was in for more than he was ready to ride, and started asking people to go get some help. If you trip, you know that he heard everything I was saying and was processing it even if he didnt know it. He knew he needed help, he knew he needed to get some space, he knew we were all trying, but everything was still so much for him. Constant back rubs and telling him he's got this can only keep him so calm until we see cops and security enter the stage area. A big security guard came up and tried to talk to us, but he just scared the kid and I could only shake my head while keeping him from running away.

I cant even start to describe how hard this kid tried to communicate with me. He kept grabbing my shoulder and staring me in the face with those eyes, but he never talked. I got nothing, but all i could do was tell him the security people werent mad, they just wanted to help, and that I was gonna get him ok. The big security guard came back with some police, and the kid nearly lost his shit. He grabbed my pants and arm with more fear than I know and if he couldve, he probably wouldve cried.

Held the cops off for a second, soothed the hurricane, got the kid cool with the security guy, and we all picked him up and put him on a stretcher. They strapped him down when he started freaking out again and he gave me one last stare and groan. The weak grunt he let out, the way he flexed against the straps, and the fact that my last half 8 of shrooms was getting to me all combined into the heaviest, most real feel I had ever felt for a total stranger. It hurt you guys.

I tried to follow him as they wheeled him away, but the security took my info and I havent seen him since. 


Yeah, shitty fucking ending right!?

I told this kid i was gonna get him ok, I tried so hard to keep him stable, and I still just let them take him away without any lifeline. I went to security the next day and and talked to the big guy who helped first, but he said the cops had him and it was beyond them.

So, reddit, here's where i need you.

There's a lot of things you can do on the interwebs, but some things need the human web. Im asking anyone who reads this to hit up anybody who may have been at Summer Set friday, and ask them if they or anybody they know had someone lose it friday or have pictures, info, or stories from that show, I know its a long shot, and Im not planning on getting too much, but anything helps. 

I have to know this kids name, I want to know how he's doing and what happened to him. 

Nobody has to help, and its a definite long shot, but I know reddit can do some great things. I've already contacted the festival, and the town, with no luck, so you guys might be my only chance.

So, fellow festies, lets have a manhunt!


Description of this kid:

Black hair, no beard, 
not short but below 6',
 wearing backwards flatbill, brown shirt, black shorts friday,
had black and green strappack, galaxy s2 phone (or wtvr)


TL;DR: Friday at Summer Set 2013, I ran into this kid who was in need, got attached, then the cops took him. I have to know his name, but I need your help.

1338416599.0	uctsm	A message to cigarette smokers at festivals.	TitsHemingway	48	32	96	"To all cigarette smokers at music festivals,

This is not meant to be disrespectful or insulting; the point of this post is to give you the perspective of what it's like to be surrounded by cigarettes as a non (cigarette)-smoker. This past weekend, I was lucky enough to experience Summer Camp in all of its glory. I had an incredible time, but easily the biggest downside was inhaling ~20 cigarettes without actually smoking one of them. I like to have a good time and party, etc., but I don't smoke cigarettes and never have. That's a personal choice, and I do not judge anyone for smoking...but the point that I would like to make here, is that in enclosed, dense situations (such as a packed concert, or under a canopy, or in a tent even), when you light up, you are not the only one who will be smoking your cigarette. 

During the first day of Scamp, I would move away from the cigarette to a new area. Unfortunately, this didn't fix much, as people would continue to light up all around me, and running from this was basically impossible unless I wanted to go all the way to the back of the crowd in isolation. There was literally a cigarette within eye's view during each show I was a part of, and I hope smokers understand that this does not only affect you, but everyone around you as well.

How do we solve this problem? Recently, bars and restaurants all over the world (not just in the US) have banned smoking indoors, or have created separate spaces for smokers and non-smokers. How do we accomplish this at a festival? Is a solution even feasible?

Just looking to start some dialogue about the subject. What do you all think? /endofrant

-Security was chill as fuck: rode around on golf carts and joked and talked with everyone, made friends, gave advice on buying/taking drugs, etc
-Campgrounds (Sunnyview Farm) were always clean and pretty, hardly any mud when it rained, fairly small and easy to get around. 
-Porta potties were actually cleaned in the morning, and there were footpump sinks available outside of them (with soap and paper towels...water was replaced every morning)
-Bands all brought their A-game. I was so thoroughly impressed by all the bands i saw, considering I hardly knew any. Even local bands (from Boston) that I had seen before blew my mind. Case in point was Alex Russo of Blue Boy Productions (whom I bought my ticket from) that played a secret set in the woods from 4-7...HOLY SHIT.
-Unlimited free water! this is so important at any festival
-My entire fucking crew! I camped with about 15 of my friends, and had at least 50 other friends from Boston there, so everywhere I went I saw a friendly face
-All the chill vibes- everyone was there to have a good time and meet new people and be friendly and not uptight or rude. 
-The size: the 5000 person cap made the whole festival chill as fuck and not overwhelming at all. there were multiple times when i walked through the forest path back to the grassy campsite and there was no one else on the path...so rare for a festival

I went back to our camping area, smoked some weed, opium... then my friends and I went down to the beach. We laid in the sand and looked up at the stars for like an hour. It was absolutely glorious. 

Later on, one of my friends grabbed his guitar and we went back to the shore and he jammed away. By 6am there was a group of about 8 musicians jamming, and some people danced around them. As this was happening, I watched the sun rise over the ocean....

We're trying to encourage and inspire users to add their own advice in order to enhance other festival goers experiences. It is a page that will be connected to a mobile app that has other useful tools for enhancing festival life.

In order to bring more attention to the page, a group of us have been generating top 5 lists about different ways to make everyone's time more enjoyable.

The page is very much still on the ground, just stretching its wings in the hope of one day taking flight. However, since using reddit there has been a significant increase in page views and I just want to say thank you to everyone who has contributed. It's excellent to see people from different countries, different ages, all sharing their thoughts on festival life. I hope r/festivals continues to support.

Please go ahead and post your tips on the page or if you can think of a new top 5 you think would be a good topic please let us know on the fb page.

The ususal stuff I bring are mostly the basics, tent, pillows, sleeping bag. etc. Is there any essential out there I need to bring to make my experience better? 

One year we brought an air horn and had an air horn battle with our neighbor across the way in the mornings. Small fold-able tables/ chairs are awesome. Frisbees are personal plates, and good to break down bud. Always bring extra blankets. Having a friend that likes to cook is a blessing. If you do dirty dishes don't forget a mini sink. Eat the food you bring before you start to buy vendor food. Extra food is easy to give away and guarantee you have to walk far to do it. Something warm for cold nights to eat/ drink and something cool for hot days etc. This is for the ladies mostly, WEAR SHOES!!!! My girlfriend has hurt her feet at every festival I have taken her, and being around medical staff at a festival is a whole other experience (not necessarily good or bad).

The ticket is a London Eurostar package for all 5 days with camping

incl. 1 Full Madness + Dreamville + Transport + Boozebag (food/drink tokens)

all up it cost 650 euros. I x-posted to a few places to get the word out because I'm not sure if people will be able to go on such short notice. So let me know if you want to go, especially if you're from London because it includes travel from London (train+shuttle) directly to the campsite and back.

1375410275.0	1jjet5	/r/festivals Let’s talk some Do’s and Don’ts	Ozzred	20	5	13	"Please feel free to add on.  These are a few things I’ve picked up over the years.

**Do’s**

* Schedules / Pre Fest Research – If you’re going to a music festival to see live music..  do it!  Many festivals publish the lineup and/or schedule in advance.  If there’s particular acts that you want to see, than know what time it is and where you need to be.  I’ve missed a lot of good acts over the years due to not paying attention or being busy doing other shit. So have a game plan and be determined to stick to it.  If there’s bands on the bill that you’ve never heard of, there’s a good chance you may like them – so check’em out in advance to know if they’re a ‘Must See’.
* Rain Gear – Getting wet for an hour or two can be awesome!  Being drenched for 2 days is a buzz kill.  If at all possible, pick up a cheap poncho at the very least.  When it comes to this type of gear, I’d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
* Sun Gear – For as bad as rain can be – sun kills…  Don’t be stupid..  If you have a canopy available to bring, do so.  If your camping without one and it’s going to be hot – have a game plan for finding shade and cooling down throughout the weekend.  And most importantly, Hydrate.. Bring lots of water and N/A’s..  We must Replenish to Rage on..    Rage. Rest. Replenish. Repeat.
* It’s a Marathon, Not a Sprint.  One of the hardest things to resist is partying til dawn the first night at a 3 day festival.  Far too many people go to hard the first night and aren’t worth a shit the next two days. So if you have the fortitude to get some sleep that night, it’ll probably pay off.  Of course, it kind of depends on your view of fatigue being a drug in and of itself.
* Medications – If you require particular medicines for daily living, don’t forget to take them.. Have a friend remind you if necessary.  Seizure folks, make sure you have your bracelets on at all times. 

**Don’ts**

* Buying Stuff..  Don’t buy anything from anyone who doesn’t fit in..  If you have any doubt, ask them a few questions about the performing acts.  Enough said. 

* Fireworks.  Look like fun from a far right..  Nobody wants to be around the asshole setting’em off..

* Some festivals are more zealous than others, but I’ve had my hot sauce bottle and flower vase taken out of our RV..  Just saving yourself the hassle and use plastic for Everything..  Transfer liqueur’s into other bottles if necessary. 

* Trash – A lot of people go through a lot of effort to make sure you don’t have to throw your trash out – use them.  That goes for cigarette butt’s as well..  

* Tents – If you aren’t 100% sure ALL the required parts are packed, find out BEFORE you leave..  Also, Stake that shit down Proper..  It’s simple, stake in one key corner than move to the next one (clockwise or counter) and pull it as tight as possible from the first stake – stake it, continue clock/counter pulling as tight as possible from the last one.

* And finally – most importantly – Don’t be a Dick..  Good vibes breed good vibes.

Stay safe festies and RAGE ON!

I ended up selling my ticket so that i could go to a LIB with my close friends instead of BM with strangers (I know I'd of have a great time anyways)

LIB was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I really didn't know what to expect considering I was preparing for BM for the greater part of the last year and to be honest i hardly knew what to expect for that either. I had watched plenty of videos to prepare me for the mindset of these festivals and i am glad i did.

One of the greatest lessons i learned from these videos and blogs was the idea of participation or tourism, I was determined to not be a tourist on my first festival nor any others. After i set up camp i was in the greatest mood and i just walked around trying to make eye contact with people so i could give them the biggest smile i could give. The reactions were hilarious, some people would immediately look away, others would look confused or creeped out, but about half the time i would see a light turn on behind there eyes and i would see a giant smile meet mine. Most of the time i would ask people for a lighter as a way to talk to the person, or if i saw someone looking like they were having a good time i would give them a high five and try to talk to them. The last night of the event however I ended up working at the Hug Deli for maybe 4 hours after Bassnector ended until the sun came up and im not gonna lie, it was the best time i had the entire time i was there. Nothing is more rewarding then standing there having people compliment you all night and giving out hugs to the amazing people there.

In the end i don't think i could ever miss this festival again, heck i may not even be able to go to BM anymore considering the price difference in tickets and expenses, especially considering I'm 20 minutes away from Irvine Lake (didnt meet a single person at LIB who drove a shorter distance then I). Anyways apologize for the extremely long post but i needed to get off my chest the amazing time I had somewhere on reddit."	t5_2re9k	True

So I really like the idea of this subreddit, and it spurred me to want to create /r/raves for essentially the same concept.  However for some reason or another /r/raves and /r/rave are both banned, so I emailed reddit about it essentially asking ""why?"".  No response.  So I created a topic in this subreddit titled /r/raves and its gone as far as I know.  Can someone please enlighten me what the reddit staff have against raves?  I'd love to actually get in the know of raves in cities where I'm not a local, hence less educated, and share the wealth as well!!  Is that too much to ask? "	t5_2re9k	True

I'm looking to go to FloydFest at the end of next month. I'm worried that the smaller crowds and different demographic (more families and such) will provide an inferior environment. Plus, the lineup consists of many lower tier bands that I'm unfamiliar with.

Are these reasonable concerns? Maybe I'm just stressed because of taking days off of work and the prospect of spending so much money.

We arrived friday, rained a little on friday night, saturday the sun was shining, then saturday night had 2 weeks worth of rain. the campsites flooded, carparks flooded, the main stage sank in the mud with all the support beams bending.

Had to cancel the music on the sunday night as it was too dangerous to carry on, but we partied on in the campsites till monday morning.

1345061006.0	ya1ns	Festival discgolf frisbees	BGSO	13	2	15	"So I finally ran out of money for fests this summer but still have northcoast on my agenda.  I know a lot people pay for festivals by selling tshirts they've made.  I'm trying to do something similar but instead of tshirts I've come up with the concept of a custom disc golf Frisbee.

At electric Forest they had something similar; however, the artwork was garbage!

The discs will cost 20 dollars and feature the logo of the fest and the date of it (possibly line-up.)  This is what the artwork will look like:

[http://i.imgur.com/Iipa7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Iipa7.jpg)

I think it's a good idea but I'm curious what a large group of festival goers thinks about the concept.  I'm about ready to invest the capital into the project and get it going but the thought of pouring money into a dead hole is not an appealing prospect.

If you'd be interested in one of these at a festival if it had different artwork please comment.  If you're going to Northcoast and would like one of these feel free to send me a pm.

http://bigdubfestival.com/

Theme camps, a swimming hole, workshops, seminars, fireworks, firespinning, vending, multiple stages, 4000-person limit! AND FREE HEATED SHOWERS!

I've gone to EDCLV and had a blast but this is very much the opposite side of the spectrum- think Counterpoint, AllGood hippie-type festivals but much, much, much smaller and intimate.

It's more about the experience than the music (last year I didn't get to a stage at all til the last night lol), though there is plenty of music! Don't expect huge artists, in fact they haven't even released the lineup yet, but last year's names included NiTGriT, 2Rip (he owns Badass), Vaski, and a multitude of other small artists.

It is hosted at Four Quarters Farm Inner Faith Sanctuary, a beautiful beautiful wooded mountain. 3 days, 3 nights, $75 presales just sold out and are still only $85 until week of.

NamelessRaver	14	3	18	"I just finished 6 weeks of radiation therapy and now i have a huge bald spot on the back and side of my head. I got a can of [UTATZ](http://www.utatz.com/) spray-on tattoo and it says it lasts up to three days (although i doubt it). I was thinking of either just shaving my head entirely bald (bic'n it) or playing with the odd hair pattern by filling the void with a giant eye... or some design. I figure i may be wearing a hat or beanie part of the day which would cover it completely and at night it'll be rubbing against my pillow - it already sounds like it'll be ruined by the second day, but i'd like to hear anyone else's experiences if they have any. I'll be doing to test on my arm or leg this week and see how that goes anyway...

I'm a 23 year old guy (if that matters) and will be travelling very lightly as my friends are bringing all my other shit with them when they are driving up on wednesday.  If anyone can give me a lift i will gladly pay for all of the gas/tolls and will buy you as many cases of beer as you can bring in.

Also i don't really care what you do to pass the time on the trip up.  Fine with smoking/drinking/any kind of music/dirty car/whatever.

Let me know!  if i can't find a ride i will have to get a plane to muskegon and take a very expensive cab.

Skipping through the crowd as Yonder started their set like a whirling dervish leaving a 80 foot trail of dust from the back of the moonshine stage crowd to the front.

Using the Chinese Dragon head I made out of paper mache` and chicken wire to walk through the festi grounds from my campsite to the campfire stage roaring at people.

1375885455.0	1jvuli	Summer Set Music Festival - disorganized, confusing rules	nanidin	11	2	21	"The [Summer Set Music Festival](http://summersetfestival.com/2013/) apparently sent out an email last night that detailed some of the rules for what can and cannot be brought to the festival this year. They didn't update their site with those rules, and only emailed people that directly purchased tickets (they were selling tickets in 4 packs, so there are a lot of people going that didn't get the email.)

I found out about the email from [their facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SummerSetFest) where people are saying that the email says no food, no tents, and no grills (propane or otherwise) are allowed. They also set limits on beer but didn't mention liquor. Their official account responded to a few posts last night then disappeared.

Another element of confusion: you apparently have to exit security and then be searched again to go between stages. GRiZ and Big Gigantic play back to back on different stages...

Anyway, just wanted to vent some of my frustration with the lack of communication and apparent disorganization of this fest. It's their second year, so hopefully in the future it gets better. If anyone has any inside contacts, could you maybe try getting them to update their website so all of these supplemental rules are actually available to people going to the fest?"	t5_2re9k	True

I was thinking of going to a 3 day camping music festival by myself in June, but I'm not sure. I'm a 20 year old girl, so I'm wondering if this is smart/safe. None of my friends can go, but I'd love to go, the lineup is to die for. On top of that, I've never been to a camping music festival before. I know a few people that are going but none that I can go with, so I thought that if worst came to worst, I could meet up with them. Is this a bad idea? What are some tips to meeting people at festies when you're by yourself? Any kind of advice you can give is greatly appreciated. "	t5_2re9k	True

Many of my favorite bands played on the first day (friday) adding some EDM acts to finish the day. During the dar i lost my voice after a Billy Talent concert and had such extreme muscle ache after Skrillex that i was barely able to walk...

On the last day i was so dehydrated and cramped up that i had to be taken to the paramedics. They gave me Magnesium there :)

As i am planning to go to some EDM festivals next year, this is going to be much more of a problem (the muscle ache) because i wont be standing and nodding my head :D

What tips and tricks do you have for me?

**Summarizing everything we have so far:**

**Physical**
BEFORE the festival
*Work out. Full body excesizes like Lunges, Jumping Jacks and Powercleans
*Go to more concerts and dance. ""Work out the party abs""

DURING the festival
*Stretch and flex
*Rest between acts
*Make sure you get some good quality sleep
*Medical tape against blisters

**Drinks**
*WATER. Get a Camelback
*Smoothies (Odwalla), Juice, Lemonade, Vegetable Juice (V8 low sodium), Coconut Milk
*Vitamin stuff such as Airborne or Emergen-C
*Sprite and Ginger-ale to keep the throat crisp
*More water, just drink more than you think you would need!

**Food**
*Fuits (Bananas!)
*Power bars
*Vitamins

Ah, become a construction worker. Don't need all of the above :)

As Counterpoint is a newish set-up (and there have been complaints of too many festivals with similar line-ups popping up around regional circuits, rather than larger ones drawing cross-country crowds), does anyone have thoughts on attending this one?  

I'd like to go, but am about six hours away from the place.  Worth it, or should I just wait until next summer's rounds to see if somewhere more local will somehow arrange such goodness?

I haven't been on tour but last year I went to almost every Camp Zoe. Last year during Schwagstock on the Saturday at 4:20 smoked a pound in front of the general store. It was like a hippie joint rolling sweat shop. There were three picnic tables put together long ways with a road atlas spread from the east coast to west to cover the cracks. In the middle of the tables were huge piles of weed people were just grabbing and grinding and rolling. So many joints.

1374592455.0	1ivz78	My first time at Evolve Festival (Nova Scotia)... having a hard time transitioning back to reality	applepomme	13	5	9	I had an amazing experience this weekend at my first ever Evolve festival. It was one of the most humanizing experiences I have had in a very long time, and by that I mean I felt connected to people again. I've been questioning the way human interaction occurs nowadays and how that may contribute to my depression/anxiety in many ways. At Evolve, no one was on their computers or their cellphones, everyone shared with one another, helped each other, and you were accepted in whatever form you came in. It was beautiful! I also had a major experience on LSD that has me thinking a lot about the world and my life, but I am unable to do so while I am back here in the busy hustle bustle of life. I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this sort of slow/low transition period after such an experience?

We're all happy to sleep on the floor/couches, we don't need anything fancy. We're all college students/recent grads and very respectful (i.e. not burnouts or sketchballs).

So please if you can, write on [their facebook](https://www.facebook.com/springawakeningfest), on [Soldier Field's facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Soldier-Field/369331536927) and [email Soldier Field](http://www.soldierfield.net/contact) and let them know camelbaks are important for hydration at festivals like this.

I went to Summercamp in Chillicothe, IL last year for the first time and loved it! The environment there was just awesome, and I love camping. 

I've heard a little bit about 10KLF (might go next year) and Rothbury (sounds awesome, but pretty pricey), are there any other festies worth checking out in the Midwest?

You can share any type of after movie. Official, fan-made, artist-made and even pre movies (trailers). Everything is encouraged!

I'm sorry if my post title sounds ignorant but I am going to my first BIG festival in a week and i have that question!  (25/F)  Due to mental health issues, i choose to abstain from psychedelics and pretty much anything heavier than pot.  I have gone through both pharmaceutical and cognitive behavioral therapy and am doing really well!  (i'm stable and no longer medicating)

  I went to a very small localish festival recently.  Over half the people at the festival stayed in their tents all weekend getting fucked up.  Don't get me wrong, I couldn't care less about other people's recreational drug use, and I was/am fully expecting to see people tripping and stuff.  I drink and smoke bud, but that's about as crazy as I get. I have a BLAST with my boyfriend at concerts and shows.  I know we will have fun, i'm just wondering about finding other people like us.

So anyway, sorry if this is the wrong sub to post in or anything.  Thanks for any input you guys have.  :-) "	t5_2re9k	True

It's the summer after graduating high school so originally my friends and I had planned on going together and having a great weekend camping...but...due to the fact that Vibes is such an expensive festival my friends decided they were only going to go for a day...after I already bought my camping ticket.  So I will be camping alone and for my first festival I'm not sure how Ideal that situation is, so I just wanted your guys' thoughts on it and how you'd approach it because I'm not sure if I should find someone to camp with or if I should just wait for my friends to show up in the days or what.  My other question would be costs of attending the festival, as in, what I'd have to spend once I'm there, how much is food usually are they're any unexpected things I might encounter?  Basically how much cash should I bring, or should I bring a card ect. I'm sorry if I sound inexperienced but well, it's just cause I am haha big thank you to anyone that responds!

Don't use Hostival!	tails09	7	2	0	"So the start of our Oktoberfest weekend has been bumpy, to say the least- We'd booked our accommodation several months ago through a group called Hostival who have operated in Munich for several years. We were told when we'd paid a deposit, that we could pay the remainder on arrival. Sometime later, and we received a dodgy looking email- full of spelling and grammatical errors, with even the name of the hostel spelled wrong- demanding full payment for the remainder of the balance, to a foreign bank account, within 24 hours. We'd considered the email to be a scam, but emailed Hostival several times, only to be receive the same scam looking email again - with no additional information.

Now, the day before Oktoberfest, we find that our accomodation has been cancelled- with no warning email from them (despite them claiming they have emailed cancellation emails to all those who have not paid- and us not receiving said email), leaving us with no accomodation the day before flying to a foreign country for the first time.

Hostival have left a really bad taste in our mouths and I hope that you will consider not using them if you are flying in for Oktoberfest."	t5_2re9k	True

1343365945.0	x8f1k	Opinions about glow sticks at festivals/concerts.	dondante78	7	3	47	"I personally think glow sticks can enhance a show if used correctly.  In my opinion it is best to throw a large quantity of glow sticks at the same time at a precise moment in a song.  I am not a fan of a few random glow sticks being thrown at random times during the show.  I also hate when people throw them at the band.  I usually do not bring any more than 100 of them at a time but considering bringing a lot more to a near future show.  Anyways, Lets hear your opinions on glow sticks.

EDIT:  So it seems the majority of people i have heard from on here and other forums say they are more annoying than anything.  Seems many do not like them for the environmental reason which i totally get and they are correct they are bad for the environment.  I keep hearing people say why don't you stay and pick them up and i keep asking myself if anyone else has ever littered at a show?  Does anyone who throws a cigarette bud on the ground or a napkin or a cup stay to help pick it up? If you are one who does that then that is awesome and preach on.  But don't tell me to pick up my glow stick as you flick a cigarette bud and drop your empty cup of booze.  Laser pointers? LED Hoop? those are not substitutes because they are not thrown or worn.  I can't believe people are entertained by shining laser pointers on speaker boxes and banners above the stage but if you are have a blast just don't shine it in anyones face.  LED hoops are cool to see people use but where i am at shows there isn't room for one of those being shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of people dancing so.  I guess you can't make everyone happy and no matter what you do at a show there could be someone who is annoyed by it.  Thanks for the opinions they are actually making me think about my stance on glow sticks. Keep them coming."	t5_2re9k	True

Went again this year and had a not-so-great time.  It wasn't just them shutting down on Saturday -that wasn't Insomniac's fault- but a slew of things that made us all-in-all disappointed with Insomniac's experience.  For example, there was a lot less art this year, they released a line-up with lots of great artists who then fell off the docket within a month of the show.  We had tons of downtime because there were few artists we knew and were excited to see.

My boyfriend suggested we go to Sasquatch next year, but I'm a little concerned about it not being a ""rave"", really.  I want to go some place where dressing up is totally cool (I didn't dress up these last two years, but had planned on making a couple costumes for next year), and where you can trade kandi and the like.

But we still want to get away from the tools/bros, and any show where at least 75% of the people look like they didn't come for the music in particular, but just paid $300 for a weekend-long party.

I don't know, does anyone in this subreddit have any ideas?  Anyone know of some great shows somewhat close to us (we're in central CA, takes 9 hours to drive to Las Vegas w/o stops), or experiences we shouldn't miss?.

tl;dr: Disappointed with EDC, interested in trying a new festival."	t5_2re9k	True

But, I need your help so that I can afford to get on the road! I need to pay some bills and save up so that I have enough gas money to fuel the beginning of my travels. Then I will make custom hoops on site along the way. I might even be able to come to a city or festival near you! I will most definitely be blogging about it on http://www.hiptronichoops.tumblr.com

Check out my Etsy shop, http://www.hiptronichoops.etsy.com , for tons of customizable hoop options, and use coupon code WANDERLUST11 to get 15% off of your order. Want something even more specific? Just shoot me a message, and I will make you the most amazing hoop you’ve ever seen :D

This is kind of a crazy scheme, and I am a little bit nervous but super excited for it to take shape: I need all of the hooping support I can get!

Of course I will keep you all updated once I start making travel plans. Hopefully it will all go down within a month or so.

I am a 20 year old person with lady parts whose plans just fell through with my group going to FPSF in Houston this weekend. I am trying to decide whether to try to just sell my ticket or just go to the festival alone and meet up with friends/meet some cool new individuals there. 

I love the idea of just going and exploring and having an unpredictable experience but I've never been on a trip or to a festival alone. Safety is something concerning, but I honestly feel like I can hold my own. 
My first festival was actually Hangout Fest this year so I'm really not that familiar with them but I absolutely loved Hangout and would hate to miss my opportunity to go to another festival.

How ever during my limited research(you would be surprised how little discussion there is about Bisco) I found out that they do search your car thoroughly and that things such as fireworks, weapons, &amp; glass(especially glass) aren't allowed. Well this leads to a question...

Do bongs/bowls count as glass and would they get confiscated?

Do sparklers count as fireworks? I was going to bring sparklers, but I wanted to cause as little trouble as possible going there.

I've read that the event staff don't really care and they aren't cops, but you can't bring mason jars since they are glass so I would have to have weed out in the open. I plan on getting everything but molly and weed from the festival itself so thats all I'm bringing up, some people said they didn't care at all if you had drugs and some said if you didn't tell them up front if you had them they would just take it.

My question is just how lax are they with the drugs entering and if I had an O or 2 in a backpack would they take it?

Also what is the best course of action to take when getting your car searched? Tell them up front or wait for them to find it? If they ask do I tell them for sure?

For any of you who have been to Bisco before that have any other tips that would be great, I already read up on the rain, water, food, print out schedules of whose playing, lantern for campsite, cash money, old shoes, etc. Thanks in advance!
