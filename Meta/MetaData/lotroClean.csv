1343749237.0	xgbl4	"Rereading ""The Hobbit"" seeing the world from the eyes of Lotro."	ThomasTyndan	56	3	16	"I just started re-reading the hobbit, amazingly it is the first time I have re-read either The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings since playing Lotro,  (5 years ago). I am not a bad fan, I've been reading other things; histories of middle earth, Children of Hurin, and non-Tolkien books as well...

Anyway, as I am reading the Hobbit I start to realize that not only are the descriptions in the books so amazingly fleshed out in the game world; Go Turbine! ... but I am also filling in gaps, as it were.

For example, when Bilbo and the Dwarves travel out of the Shire (from the Green Dragon) There is a one page description of their journey where Tolkien talks about visiting areas with very different people and things Bilbo has never seen, and then the first place he names is that they are in the Lone Lands, where all civilization seems to disappear, there are no roads that are not in disrepair and only a few ruins of old forts are visible (which are described as very evil looking). In a single Page they traveled across parts of the Shire and Bree-land!

But In that one page I imagined them traveling the roads past where Adso's camp will on day be, and then turning south, bypassing Bree via Andrath, then going through Chetwood South, maybe seeing the Yellow tree as more of a Sapling, and perhaps even passing by the old Forsaken Inn.

Now I know a lot of this stuff is soft Cannon, but wow, it really impressed me how much I could mentally visualize everything in a very new way. I am suddenly excited in a brand new way to read my beloved books!

1366523460.0	1cscl6	The Great Riddermark Pig War of 2013	Eskolaite	46	3	7	"This is a tale which takes place on the server of Riddermark.

At approximately 1:00 A.M. EST, on April the 21st of 2013, a Riddermark Burglar was testing a move outside on boar outside of Bree. This led to the discovery of an invincible pig, of level 12. This pig reached 0 morale and stayed alive. For the next ~20 minutes, various people in the glff channel of Riddermark showed up outside the south gate of Bree to attempt to beat this pig to death. We were unsuccessful. The pig even managed to kill a level 85 player through some wizardry (his death can be seen in the chat window in one of the images posted below). At approximately 1:20 A.M. EST, April 21st 2013, the decision was made to take the pig into Bree. As the pig entered Bree, it became vulnerable, and was subsequently killed by a level 41 player. This was met with much dismay. 

And that, my friends, is the saga of the Great Riddermark Pig War of 2013.

1361006870.0	18mr0y	Turbine: latest official forum comments, the what's happening ??? as of Middle of Friday night PST.	exploderator	45	7	9	"Hey all, as I wade through 15 pages of LOTRO forum posts, here's the latest relevant official comments from the service update discussion thread on the main forums.  I've just copy&amp;pasted various interesting comments as I found them, roughly in order of apparent importance, that collectively explain a lot about what's happening and why the long delay.

------------------------------------------

&gt; **Celestrata:**
&gt;
&gt; **Hey everyone, I have an update for you all.**
&gt;
&gt; **So it looks like that at this point that we are definitively not coming back up this evening. The teams still need more time to complete their work. However, we of the night shift will be continuing to work on this maintenance throughout the evening/morning hours.**
&gt;
&gt; **Again, all of us here thank you for your continued patience and understanding. We're going to continue to work to get our services back up and available for you all again.**

------------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Mekerek : So I am just curious ... Any details as to what's really being done behind the scenes for Turbine/WB?  (Yes I am more technical so like to hear details about the back end activity)

&gt; Celestrata: We actually have mentioned this a few times in various threads, but I'm happy to say it again. 
&gt;
&gt; The work that we have been performing is a very large-scale upgrade to our back-end systems, including our billing tools and customer service tools. Obviously, this is a large maintenance that affects everything that our games rely on, and that's why this has taken so long.

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; BrittanyM:North American players would appreciate to know if they should just start turning in for the night or hang in there because we can get our dailies etc and some Friday night gaming in...

&gt; Celestrata: We did actually state earlier that it appears that the service will not be available tonight, so you may wish to turn in for the evening.

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt;  bootcher: I'm also pretty sure there are several salary employees (not all), that are working past their 8hr work day to get the servers back up.

&gt; Celestrata: To be completely honest with you, in the last 36 hours, there are quite a few people who have been here for at least 30 of them.
&gt;
&gt; The teams involved are working extremely hard in getting everything back up for you guys. If you want a visible example, look at my posting history and Sapience's posting history. You may notice that we're switching off in 12 hour shifts.  However, one of us is always here. 
&gt;
&gt; And, with that said, our processes are still ongoing, but it most certainly looks like progress is being made.

---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Zottkanf:hmmm odd...not a rant, just curious.
 I work in the industry and the 'back end' systems are there for this exact reason. They are BACK END systems. Meaning they shouldn't have anything to do directly with your game servers, therefore you SHOULD be able to shut them down completely and do maintenance all the while leaving your actual game servers open to the public as you do with the lotro store.

&gt; Celestrata: Unfortunately, in this case, these are systems that need to be checked. Again, we've mentioned that one of the systems that is going through this upgrade is the billing system. When you log in, the game asks the billing system what type of account you are, have you paid your subscription, etc. These are pieces of information the game itself needs to know so it knows what to give you and how to treat your account.

----------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; Dirgeros:  I pray that all of our toons are all intact when you bring the servers back online in the future. Sooooo much time &amp; energy went into building them. Do we have anything to worry about in this regard, Cel?

&gt; Celestrata: You need not worry for your character's safety. As I stated, our work is on the back-end systems, like our billing system. The game itself was not worked on during this maintenance, and has not been changed.

---------------------------------------

*(non official but informative)*
&gt;&gt; Lashmore: From what I've read on twitter and dev posts and what I understand about processes from my own IT work experience before I moved to more labour based work is that Turbine had a list of jobs for this maintenance period each with an order to be done in and an estimated allocated time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At one point one of their processes came up with the error that caused the extension as they couldn't move onto the next process until this one was completed and thus one process took much longer than estimated to fix/get going right before they could move onto the next.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I believe they are past that now from the feeling I get from recent posts and are moving through the remaining processes.

1343833113.0	xiaji	Turbine expects their customers to pay for Turbines mistakes	Tobias_Reaper	48	11	23	"What do I mean with this bold statement? Turbines Character Naming Policy for Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) (http://support.turbine.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=37&amp;) states, among other things, that no player character may share a name with an in-game NPC. This is fine at first glance.  Problems arise however, when Turbine introduces new NPCs – they never check if those names are already used by player characters. A reoccurring theme therefore, is that people with well researched, lore appropriate names, who have been playing that character for months or years and made “a name for themselves” suddenly have their name requisitioned by turbine.

The immediate result of this is that the character in question is accused of a Naming Policy violation (which, btw, is automatically threatening with bans and other account action, even if I have never heard of a case like this actually resulting in a ban) and the “offending” player character gets renamed with a generic fantasy name from the random name generator. Results can be as nice, fitting and lore-appropriate as “Lakgorbor” as name for a hobbit. If you picture that name should belong to an orc-chief…  well, Turbine disagrees. This renaming to a randomly generated name happens without talking to the player at all – even if the player is online, on that very character, in the moment of renaming.

Obviously these events are more likely to hit players with Tolkien styled names rather than the various “IgankOrcs” running around. And it’s those players who are well invested in their names, who find it difficult to “live” with a name from the random generator. However, adding insult to injury, Turbine does not even offer affected players a free character rename to an appropriate name. Instead customers who effectively have their names “stolen” by Turbine are referred to the LotRO store, where they can buy a rename for 995 Turbine points (close to 10 dollar/euro)

So effectively, Turbine expects their customers to pay for mistakes / oversight from Turbine.

This, in my opinion, is a very underhanded business practice. And even though it will only ever affect a small subset of LotRO players, it should not go un-commented

1338716066.0	uifpm	Here's a big thank you to one of the coolest guys on r/lotro, Sir ThomasTyndan! (some details inside)	quantumphoenix	35	4	7	"So I'm a big LoTR geek ever since I read the books in Grade 4. I've watched the movies, read other books and played videogames. One game I wasn't able to play was Middle Earth Online back then because it required a subscription and as a kid I didn't want my parents to keep paying for just a video game I'd play for just some hours a day. 

Flash forward to when LoTRO became f2p and I was one of the first ones in line. I loved the game. The visuals, the lore, everything.

 I continued to play as an f2p player just grinding out token points to unlock places like Moria (took a several months). I never got a subscription because I'm a bit short on money and all my money goes to tuition, textbooks, food, etc. (life of a college student trying to save up) haha. 

Anyway some months back, I made this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/rlv03/any_way_to_earn_free_turbine_points_i_cant_afford/) because I was having a tough time getting turbine points. Then Sir ThomasTyndan, a man among men, said [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/rlv03/any_way_to_earn_free_turbine_points_i_cant_afford/c470osf). And BAM! Two month VIP Account! And those two months were some of the coolest times I've had playing LoTRO fully. So I would just like to dedicate this post to ThomasTyndan, an awesome man in remembrance of giving me two of the most awesome months I've had playing LoTRO. Thank you ver much!


**tldr; Sir ThomasTyndan is awesome!**


See you guys in Middle Earth!

So, this week Skirmishes are on sale. So just how much money can you save, and what should you be getting if you want them all for the cheapest option? First of all, only individual ones are on sale, the packs are not. With that in mind, lets look at some math.

The normal price for the skirmishes stands at 195 each. There are 8 to buy, so with no sale, you are looking at 1560 TP for all 8 of them. That's quite a pile. If you buy them now, on sale, you are looking at 8 for 156, or 1248, for a savings of 312.

Now some of you might be saying ""I don't have 1248 TP sitting around. What should I do?"" Well, lets look at how much the cost changes when you factor in the packs. You can get three attack skirms for 475 (Thievery and mischief, attack at dawn, and Icy Crevasse), which would cost 585 (Reg) or 468 (Sale) meaning the sale only actually saves you 7 points off the pack. There is also the defend pack, for 625 which includes 4 skirms (Stand at Amon Sul, Defense of Prancing Pony, Ford of Bruinen and Survival: Barrow Downs) which would cost 780 (Reg) or 624 (sale) meaning right now you are saving only 1tp off that pack.

So the sale prices don't matter as much as long as you plan to get the packs. The only one not included is Storm on Methedras. So if you are short on TP, but want to get the skirms, only worry about Storm on Methedras right now, and get the others as packs later, for an overall cost of 625+475+156= 1256

TL:DR
If you are short on turbine points, and want to take best advantage of the sale, only buy Storm on Methedras and get the attack and defend packs later, as you don't save many TP buying them all individually."	t5_2rfus	True

I've always had a soft spot in my heart for LotRO because I had followed it since it was still Middle Earth Online in development. But I never got too far into it. 

So when I came back, I was expecting it to feel aged and clunky and overly complicated. But I am pleasantly surprised. They've added several quality of life elements, and the game still looks pretty decent.

1. Open tagging. Seriously, every game should have this. I couldn't get back into WoW after GW2 because I always resented other players. An MMO where you want to avoid people isn't an MMO in my book anymore.

2. The loot wallet, for lack of a better term for it. This changes how I play. I no longer have to kill, run to my mob, and loot. As a loremaster, that is huge. I always felt like ranged classes had it a TINY bit rougher because they'd kill, have to run 30 yards to the corpse, and loot. It felt unnecessarily dragged out. This is great.

3. Tooltips for things that aren't obvious. Like open tagging. 

Are there any other things that a returning player should know about? I played for a while at release, and then a bit of f2p right before Rise of Isengard (which I preordered and then never played =\)."	t5_2rfus	True

Having the distinction of officer, kinsman, and friend of the kin doesn't really serve any purpose. I propose a simple change to the system: let the color of your tag represent what server you play on (similar to askscience's panelist legend). In this way, people can easily identify other users on their particular server and ask them questions, strike up fellowship, etc.

Note, this is not an issue of bias or anything like that. It's simply a means of improving communication amongst members of this subreddit.

Either way, the reason I am asking for this is because I am playing alone on Snowbourn and I have a few characters I like so I don't really want to move to Gladden. I am sure there are many players like me who visit the subreddit only occasionally but would appreciate a list like that.

EDIT: let's just think of how to do it on the sidebar before the post gets burried and forgotten. It would be great to have a lasting list because we keep having the posts about people palying on different server in the subreddit but their fame is very temporary

___________________________________________
*Let's start with why I think this game could be overwhelmingly successful very soon.*

**1) Helm's Deep:** This is probably the most iconic name in Middle-earth. With the recent announcement, Turbine can definitely expect to gain a bigger crowd from not just the LotR community, but from the MMO community as well. If Helm's Deep makes a return to the depth and challenge of instances like The Rift of Nurz Ghashu, Dar Narbugud, and Ost Dunhoth (Rift/DN/OD), it will be the most successful expansion the game has had since release.

**2) End-game solo content:** Hytbold. Watching a pile of rubble slowly grow into a sprawling community was a genius way of satiating those of us who lack the specs (or interest) for end-game raiding. Major props for creating a ""soloable"" end game that was worthwhile. I know this was created to divert interest from the delayed instance cluster, but I will not complain; it held my interest.

**3) Upcoming Revamps:** I'm crossing my fingers here. The housing revamp will ideally bring some life into the currently stagnant and dead neighborhoods. Rumors of ""skill trees"" will naturally bring up mixed responses, but any upcoming change to the current traiting system is  warranted. When my 85 burglar hasn't changed his traits since Moria (outside of traiting for CJ's in Draigoch), there's an issue. Traiting no longer has any diversity between characters of the same class.
___________________________________________
*The following is why I think this game could be dead within 2-3 years (or extremely unpopulated).*

**1) End-game loot:** This is the biggest change that Turbine needs to consider for the upcoming expansion, and will be the main cause for the game's deterioration otherwise. The end-game scene has changed from ""earn your loot"" via completing challenge mode in Tower of Orthanc or Ost Dunhoth, to ""grind your loot"". In the early days, end-game thrived on trying to accomplish your Tier 2 Challenge deeds, which were the only significant way to acquire quality gear. Today's end-game community strives to exploit the game (School exploit, FLM T2 exploit).

I see many comments from players, saying things like ""I would've stopped playing a month ago if I didn't have the opportunity to exploit."" High-quality gear is supposed to be a measure of achievement in the game. When this gear loses it's rarity, it loses the interest of raiding kins. Having 85 characters with purple quest gear and two First Age Weapons is the epitome of a broken system. 

A simple solution: Bring back the ""lock"" system implemented in OD, ToO, Rift, and DN. Remove seals from 3/6 mans, or at least make the amount from older runs (Tham Mirdain, Annuminas, Great Barrow) insignificant and unrewarding to farm. Give people a REASON to do newer instances.

**2) The Ettenmoors and PvMP:** I don't consider myself an expert here by any means, only having a few Rank 7's myself. But talk to any veteran ""freep"" or ""creep"", and I'd guarantee that they will have an issue with the state of the Moors as it stands. (Pay-to-win, PvE, lag issues, unbalanced, too easy to rank, no new zone, etc.)

**3) End-game raiding content:** It is nonexistent. We were given an 85 version of Filikul (commonly known as the ""Turtle"") in Battle For Erebor. We were given an easily exploitable Flight to the Lonely Mountain which was removed for nearly a month. We were given The Fires of Smaug, which you can easily 9-10 man on Tier 1. When I heard they were scaling OD, there was a brief glimpse of hope for a decent end-game raid, albeit primarily for nostalgia purposes. Then they butchered OD into multiple instances, and scaled the difficulty down to where the instance is now unrecognizable. Combined with the new loot system, Hytbold is the only aspect of end-game content where Turbine has not ruined the game and caused numerous raiding kinships on my server to disband and move on to different games.

**4) Helm's Deep:** If it continues the trend of the Riders of Rohan expansion and end-game, it will be a disaster. 
___________________________________________
I will end by saying that I have poured more money than I can count into this game, I'd like to think I've seen enjoyed every aspect that this game has to offer, and I hope for nothing but the best. I haven't logged into the game since the first day of the Anniversary Festival, because I don't want to bother exploiting and/or grinding the same repetitive instances over and over. Can't wait for Helm's Deep, crossing my fingers that it is the best expansion yet!

___________________________________________
**TL;DR** - The Riders of Rohan expansion has ruined the game. The upcoming Helm's Deep expansion will either revitalize it to it's greatest state since release, or it will continue the trend and the game will be dead in a few short years."	t5_2rfus	True

Slayer Deeds:

**Brigand Slayer (and advanced)**

Narrowcleave - around 34.7S, 66.8WW

**Goblin Slayer (and advanced)** 

Either: 

* Forested Area - around 25.0S, 69.2W
* Fort - 25.0S, 66.8W (recommended) 

Both areas are located across from one another, so it's easy to switch if you're bored of the scenery. 

**Harvest Fly Slayer (and advanced)** 

The Vale Height - around 33,1S, 65.0W

This is a very small area, but it's the only area in The Shire that has a **ton** of Harvest Flies. When I did it I ran up The Vale Height by path, killed all of the Harvest Flies at the top, and then exited by the opposite side of The Vale Height, killed the rest of the Harvest Flies, and then ran to the Inn in Stock, after exiting the Inn, I found that the Harvest Flies respawned. This is a good technique for a person who likes to keep moving and hates waiting, if you're fine with waiting, set yourself back up at the beginning, rinse, and repeat. 

**Slug Slayer (and advanced)**

Rushock Bog - 29.3S, 74.3W

Very boring deed. Just keep running in circles and listen to some music. 

**Spider Slayer (and advanced)** 

The Quarry - around 27.9S, 65.7W

**Wolf Slayer (and advanced)**

Either:

* Dora Brownlock's Farm (and just North of it is the lair) - 31.3S, 72.7W
* Bridgefield Wall/Puddifoot's Fields - 30.5S, 63.1W/31.1S, 64.2W (recommended) 

The latter is recommended because they are so close to each other, and there are so many wolves in both those areas. You will not have to wait for any respawns as compared to if you deed at Dora Brownlock's. "	t5_2rfus	True

Post the character bio of your main character on LOTRO. Feel free to include pictures of you character, add some notes about the character, whatever you want. I will pick 3 winners (totally subjective) based on 3 categories:

1) Best Overall - the most compelling and interesting Bio.
2) Most Middle-earth - The Bio which best fits the spirit of Middle-earth and Tolkien Lore.
3) The Wild Card - I will pick a bio that just really stands out to me, for whatever reason.

I will post the winners at the end of the week, and also say why I chose them. Each winner will get 750 Turbine points.

I hope this turns out to be fun!

And then I started thinking about how in Withy we have a 'reddit' chat channel, but some Redditors who play on that server and aren't in the Reddit kin don't seem to be aware of it (or don't want to talk to other Redditors, which is fair enough!)

Anyway, if this isn't already the case, I was thinking it would be great if a 'reddit' channel was established on every server, so that you are guaranteed to be able to chat with other Redditors regardless of server and kin. Like 'glff', but more exclusive.

If there already is a 'reddit' channel on each server, great! Let it be known that anyone who is just starting out in the game, or switching servers, can hop in and type '/joinchannel reddit' and instantly be part of the community.

1361338705.0	18vd7x	Power leveling, 75-85.		22	2	16	"I rarely if ever post stuff like this but this game has been around for 5 years now and there are those of us with lots of toons and we are tired of grinding out levels with alts. With that said, this has been the best power leveling I've ever seen. 

This is what you will need to maximize your monster kill XP:

1. Go to your barter wallet and click the ""perks"" button. Then buy the rested XP boost. 

2. Go to the store and buy the 100% XP from monster kills for 1h (150 Tp).

3. Go to Wyrthing near Snowbourne.

4. Have several of your kinmates mount up on their war steeds and go on follow on one of them. Preferably a tank of some sort who can pull mobs.

5. Have the ""driver"" start running through the fields near Snowbourne picking up all the mobs he can while the rest of you DPS the targets.

Normally this will give you 3,500 xp PER KILL (it's a little lower at 75 but at 76 it gets boosted.)  At this rate you can level from 75-80 in about 4 hours. But with the 100%xp boost until the 26th you get 6,448 xp PER KILL so if you do the math, every 4 or 5 mobs you kill equals to 1 quest turn in. And with good DPS you are killing 4 to 5 mobs with in 10-15 seconds. With the 100% Xp right now for monster kills I leveled from 80-85 in 2 hours.

And a bonus is having lootbox drops. This last run we had about 8 keys drop and 6 boxes.

Enjoy."	t5_2rfus	True

I've played since day one of the beta, my main toon was Lauwen on the Laurelin[RP] Server...this was until the damn turbine takeover. My account transfer didn't go through in time (a small fault of mine and a huge load of fault on Turbines part - but I wont go in to that).

I lost almost 4-5 years (give or take) worth of play time, achievements, mounts, gold, items and friends (all my old character names are locked on Laurelin (as according to Turbine, they are still there), so I can't even re-roll the toons!). I couldn't bring myself to play for a long while!

I have made the hard decision to come back, so, me and 2 friends have all re-rolled (they both lost accounts during the transfer) on the Crickhollow server and I have to say we are loving every minute of it.

We're glad to be back and can not wait to hit Rohan.

1307603661.0	hvc1i	r/lotro It's time we had a chat about The Unwritten Rules of Fellowing...	himejirocks	21	1	24	"There are tons of these posts on the forums and I am pretty sure I am beating a dead repost by talking about this but if there is even a slim chance to help someone out... I'll take it.

**The Unwritten Rules of Fellowing**
     please feel free to add on to the list

**1. Every fellow has a leader, please let him lead.**

 You may be a tank, and have to hit first, or a ranged and have to pull a certain mob, but as funny as the youtube video is, nobody likes a Leroy. Your leader has a lot to do making sure each member is up to speed on the next fight (info giving, quest checking, food eating). Let him give the go before you **go**. 

**2. Everyone is a noob the first time. ASK if you don't know.**

 It is wayyy better to take a little time in the beginning to ask what you are suppose to do than mess up and wipe the fellow. Alot of quests have an 'easy n quick' way to get though them. And those ways often change during the updates.  I have never seen hard feelings about someone asking questions.

**3. Be Prepared.**

 Silly thing to have to say, I know, but please buy your fear/poison/disease/wound/hope pots before you enter...The leader will often ask if everyone has 'x' pot before certain fights. Not only will having a full stack help you, you have enough to give a few to the toon who forgot...pay it forward... To tell the truth, you should have a full stack of each linked to your quickslot bar even for soloing...

**4. Know your role!**

Everyone has a role to play and good fellows become great fellows when each do what they are suppose to, when they are suppose to! Read the forums! There are lots of 'how to' guides out there. 

I know hunter and mini the best so let me give you 2 examples.

 A good hunter uses his awesome dps to beat down the target quickly. 

 A great hunter keeps an eye on the fellow for poison, while DPSing but controls his aggro so as not to take it from the tank. He watches his healer to make sure he is safe, while watching not to hit any mobs stunned by the LM.  He can also burn hot at a momments notice to pull aggro of the tank if needed to give the tank time to heal. He also can see the fight from a birds eye view and call out this often missed (new mobs, damage areas, etc)

A good mini heals.

A great mini is traited to buff the fellow without needing to attack a mob and keeps the buffs up as much as possible. He times his skills so that the fellow have an in combat morale increase as often and long as possible. He never runs low on power using planning and smart healing. He channels all attacks through the tank (option menu) so as not the take aggro, and only uses aggro pulling heals as a last resort. He knows that it is sometimes better to let a toon die than to die himself...sometime that is hard to do...

**5. Understand assist windows**

So the leader placed an assist window on the tank. (common practice)
Don't attack until you see the health start to go down (or you see that that toon is the one the tank plans on killing first). The tank may be cycling through toons to get aggro. You start attacking everything he does you might pull aggro of him making his job harder...

**6. Wait before you attack.**

Let the tank get the aggro. I know this scares the shit out of minis because just by running into a mob can take off half of the tanks health but wait. You pop a heal too soon and half of them are gonna run straight for you.  Just remember, ""One hit aint worth spit, Three hits and the mob's your bitch."" 

**7. Although this should be number 1. TURN ON YOUR VOICE!!!**

 So you dont have a mic, do it anyway. Typing for the leader takes time. You need to be able to listen. Leaders do a 'can every one hear me' before each fellow. You don't have to talk, but you NEED to hear. Sleeping family in the room?? then maybe now is not a good time to fellow...harsh yes..but comunication is key to many instances.
 And for gods sake, if you can't hear, are having audio problems...PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell everyone before you are fighting the last boss on a shit long run and everyone is yelling at you and you are not listening.....PLEASE!!! &lt;deep breath....exhale...ok&gt;

**8. Don't chat speak while in raid.**

 I am so bad at breaking this rule. While you are in a raid and you have tons of people only the most needed conversation should be voiced. When a leader asks a question, type it, don't just yell out ,""I do!"". There is little chance that the leader saw the flickering red symbol by your name flash.

**9. Don't loot until the mobs are dead.**

 Anyone loots during a fight and I am rolling on everything, even non class related stuff, just to get the crap off my screen. Also you need the time to look at that shiny new cuff that just dropped and deside if you really need it...I WANT to give it to you! I really do!
 Depending on the style (and size for laptop users) the person's screen loot can hide wardens gambits and LMs. Wait until everything is dead.

**10. Don't loot until everyone is up. (Rezed)**

 Same thing with the retreat countdown. It can hide the loot list and you don't know what you are rolling on.

**11. Learn how to do FMs and listen when they are being set up.**

 There are posts online about how to do these and I have posted about it before. A well timed FM can keep your fellow alive and cause nashing of teeth if you are the cause of the fail... Stuns and bad timing can't be helped but missing it because you were drinking Mountain Dew...not good!!!...unless...well I guess if you brought enough to share for all....

**12. Not all skills should be used in a fellow...no matter how uber cool they are. Unless you are really really sure it is safe to do so.**

 I remember using Rain of Thorns in the Grand Stairs instance and the arrows dropped down to aggro all the mobs hundreds of feet under where we were standing..oops.. 

 Another time I was on mini auto mode (you know push 1, push 2, sip drink, eat chip, push 3) when I was brought back down to earth by my whole fellow yelling at me. My cool double phantom sword attack (mini skill) was messing up something they were trying to set up...oops..

 You have pets running off to aggro mobs and AOE attacks killing the wrong mob (and ruining hard modes), bleed attacks causing mobs to heal...the list goes on..

**13. Ok this one is just a minor pet peeve but...PLEASE thank your fellow when you finish.**

 I have only have had this happen in PUGs but...great run, loot chest, BAM drop group....uh...you're welcome??

So you getting aggro from family and have to drop quickly. Fine, but it only takes a second to drop a, ""TY, GG!"" before you go.

 It is best to be polite to people with big swords and bears as pets...just sayin...
(jesting aside people remember problems and being polite might get you that next invite you really really want...)



So here is my list for now...add your own and I will put them in the list. And see ya on the other side!!!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Note:

To accomplish all the deeds in Sarnur you have to explore the entire area, and for that reason there's no point in giving specific details on the locations. 

This is the first of these guides. I am in the process of completing every deed in every region in LOTRO, and it required me to do some looking up on certain deeds because I simply did not know the best location to do some of them. This inspired me to start to do these posts.

I know that there are a ton of websites out there that provides information such as this. Most of them, however, seem a little complex - and I wanted to see if it would be a bit more helpful to fit all of it on one page. I also am going to be giving my personal suggestions on how to go about specific deeds. Ered Luin's deeds are very basic due to it being a starter area, you don't have to kill as many of the creatures for the Slayer Deeds and the areas you can find these creatures usually are small, making it go by that much quicker. Be in mind that in future posts of future regions I will take the deeds that I found to be difficult (long, boring) and tell you how I went about it to make it go by a little quicker. 

Thanks for viewing and I hope this helps.

The categories are:
1) Best Overall
2) Most Middle-earth
3) Most inventive / interesting.

Don't just post pictures, or you probably won't win. I want to hear how you came to the decision of the outfit, why you chose it, and interesting details about it.

Again, I will go first. Although I do not consider this my best it was the most complex to make. I present the Beorning Costume set:

http://www.thomasriley.info/lotro/images/Showcase.jpg

My character can change animal shapes from to a:
Ram, Boar, Turtle, Crow, Bear, Rabbit... andI am still building new costumes for this set.

Alrighty, you have until Saturday night to them posted, at which point I will judge the winners.

**Edit: Bigger Prizes** Ironchef33 is going to add to the pot for the 3 winners! Remember to get your entry in before tomorrow night!

**WINNERS!**

Best Overall: Dokomax - for the Scarlet Assassin. Although all 3 variations were cool, the explanation of the outfit was cool, and I really liked how well the mono-chromatic colors just work on these pieces. Like a Lotro Red Riding Hood.

Most Middle-earth: AgamemnonV1 - I like the ranger outfit, especially becuase of how it was constructed from so many sources and still looks great. Also keeping it well tied in to a character bio is good. It is how a cosmetic should be formed, with lots of care and thought.

Most Inventive / Interesting: object404 - For Boba Fett, a lot of the interesting ones on this thread were people with garish trolling costumes, but this one was both interesting and inventive. Although I have come to hate most things related to Star Wars, Boba Fett still awesome.

I'm sure most of you already know of the [LOTRO wiki](http://lotro-wiki.com/). Great Resource if you've never played LOTRO before.

Here are a few others I found..

* http://mehq.net/dynmap/index.php - A map quest item/NPC/POI finder tool.
* http://lotro.mmodb.com/quests/ - A quest database (may be out of date/inaccurate). 

&gt;cheeseshirecat:

&gt;* http://www.burgzerg.com - they have nice maps of where to grind for deeds and virtues, especially comes in 
&gt;handy for location deeds (i.e. visit these 5 places Angmar)

&gt;* http://lotro.mmorsel.com - really good tools for determining legendary item points, where to earn turbine points and they recently put up a virtue finder, great site overall.

&gt;* http://lotrogear.appspot.com - good armour/gear data tables and http://northshield.co.uk/LOTRO/ which shows what all the gear looks like on a toon.


&gt;xenjiro:

&gt;* http://www.theblackappendage.com/monstermanual - For those PvMP'ers out there this is a great resource

&gt;StickySnacks:

&gt;* http://lotro.allakhazam.com 


If anyone has better web resource links for LOTRO please share them. I'll add them to my post. I just found these by Google, but I thought it'd share them with some of my fellow LOTRO newbs. 

edit: Right, so I just realized that the [official lorebook](http://lorebook.lotro.com) already has a quest database and interactive map which kind of makes the links I posted somewhat redundant, but I'll leave them up anyway. Again, if there's anything useful outside of the lorebook post it."	t5_2rfus	True

The game is free to play but some stuff is locked out right? Is it advisable to pay the monthly fee to have access to everything? It's been a long time since I last played so I'm assuming there have been a decent amount of changes to the game but what would be the biggest ones? What's the endgame like now and does Lotro still have the pretty awesome story quests that I remember?

Just thought I'd make a quick post here. 

I had a little extra cash and have been wanting to buy an SSD to put LOTRO on for a long time, so I finally took the plunge. In my shopping endeavor, I posted around on tech forums like Tom's Hardware etc. asking for recommendations, and was surprisingly met with a massive wall of criticism about how its a waste of money and nothing will actually be faster. I was highly recommended by numerous people *not* to put LOTRO on an SSD, because ""MMOs don't benefit from this technology"". 

I just wanted to throw it out there and confirm that the new drive *is indeed amazingly fast*, and improves load times *severely* when compared to the 7200rpm hard disk drive off of which I was previously running the game. Start screen to in game loads in around 10 seconds on all of my toons, and an in-game load (something like Galtrev to Bree, for instance) is nearly instantaneous, probably less than a full second. There's also no stuttering in freshly loaded, highly populated towns.

Obviously experiences will vary based on the other components of your computer, but if anyone else has been thinking about this, I personally recommend it."	t5_2rfus	True

1334894590.0	sj3b4	Dear Turbine :  Learn to run a business.	pr1mu5	44	27	70	"So let's see here.  I've spent over a year building a reddit kin on Gladden server.  I don't know how much money I've made Turbine over the years, but it's not a small amount.  There are over 400 characters in the kin, and I'd say we've had at least 50-100 individual people in the kin that have spent actual hard money on the game, either buying expansions, VIP status, or Turbine points.

So today, we had a 12-man raid of Draigoch.  It was our kin's second attempt at it.  And it bugged out at the very last minute, screwing our entire kin out of any reward from the 20+ combined hours we spent running this raid.  Out of rage, they all quit, but I stayed behind, waiting patiently over 30 minutes for a GM (Turbine-paid Game Master) to come help/assist.  

After a short banter, I was told to basically 'submit a bug report' and to 'start over'.  I retorted that this is not the proper way to treat VIP customers, and that these 'GMs' should have some ability to reward/compensate the players who work at this raid and then get nothing in return.  

At first, I was pointed to some hacky forum post supposedly giving me direction on how to try and work around the bug (a bug that shouldn't exist in the first place!), and after I continued to point out that this isn't ideal treatment of your paying customers?  

They banned me.

I write software for a living.  If I took a customer complaint, and instead of trying to reimburse them for their time, or money, or at least lent a gracious and sorrowful ear to their troubles, I instead put them out in the dark and revoked their access to the software they had PAID FOR, I'd be out of business.

I recommend next time you think about shelling out $1 to Turbine or it's subsidiaries, you think of another way to use your money more wisely.

**TL;DR:  Don't give Turbine your money, because when you need support, they are not going to care.**"	t5_2rfus	True

I have tried out LotRO before when they had 10 day trials but couldn't really get into it and so I downloaded it a few days ago again now that it's F2P and I spent a few hours last night just completely geeking out in the Shire once I finished the intro quests (which I started an Elf and enjoyed the intro quests for them regarding Skorgrim and Dwalin etc..)

I must have spent a good 20-30 minutes in Bag-end just geeking out picturing where some of the events of the Hobbit and LoTR took place inside the hobbit hole. I am a huge Tolkien fan and have read all of his work except the Children of Hurin.

So far with the game I'm a level 8 Guardian Elf and I've done a few quests and I understand that the freebie's are limited but for the first time in my short MMO life I feel no need to grind as fast as I can to reach max level. Once I reached the Shire I spent a good amount of my time just exploring the different parts and recalling certain events from the books. I still don't understand a lot of how to play but I'm sure I will find my way.

Also, I meet some of the nicest people that invited me to a kinship and they all answered my complete noob questions, this was quite a shock compared to the cesspool that WoW is.

I am new to LotRO and would like to join a suitable server. I don't feel like questing alone so it would be great if you could recommend a server with some cool people on it. Unfortunately I could not find out in the game client what the server populations are or maybe I was just to blind to find them :).

Thanks for your responses in advance and I am looking forward to Middle Earth and hope the game is what I hope it would be.

* Right side tank (guard) runs to troll and shoots arrows at it. Troll runs straight to healer and wipes group.
* Right side tank keeps dying for no apparent reason. Turns out their healer is a level 83 RK. 
* Left side tank dies. Lvl 85 hunter was targeting melee side and melee ends up doing 40k more damage. Inspecting him reveals Lvl 83 armor. He blames healer."	t5_2rfus	True

My comment in the above thread, was that I haven't regretted buying anything this year because I haven't bought nor needed to buy a new game since I found out about this game a little over two years ago.

Actually, the only regret I have is not finding out LOTRO earlier.  Relatedly...I would have been ALL OVER the lifetime subscription thing when it was first offered :)

I haven't done this in a while, because I certainly felt that people were irritated with this subreddit becoming a soapbox for our kin, but hey once a year posting about our kin isn't overdoing it IMO.  Plenty of other repasta on reddit, why not us?

So, who are we?  Redditors.  Ragtag group of players, and many of us have become 'friends' outside of LOTRO.

What do we do?   Very few of us are hardcore players, but if that's your style, join us!  We'll at least help you get to end game, and then you can move on to a hardcore raiding kin if our 'style' doesn't meet your requirements.  Most of us are very lackadaisacal, enjoy farting around, some raiding, some questing, and a few of us are very much into MOORS (PvP) play.

How do you join?  Look to the right, those are our officers.  Mention reddit to any of them, and you're in.  Just make sure you join the Gladden server (and complete the introduction, you can't join a kin until after you do that!).

Why us?  Why not?  Sure, you can start your own forever alone kin with your one or two friends, but why not be part of something bigger?  Come out of your shell, come talk to us on Ventrilo, get free crafted armor and weapons, free advice on how to improve your game, and get that warm good feeling of passing it on and paying it forward to the next lower level guy that joins.  I tell you, it's fun going and spanking that boss/troll that some younger player is having trouble with when you're 30 levels it's senior. :)

We would only play when the other person was online so we wouldn't drift apart in the leveling process. Server and class wouldn't be a big deal because i'm fairly agreeable. just reply or pm me if your interested and we can hopefully get going sometime soon. also if you have a really tight schedule or work a graveyard shift it might not be the best. finally i do have school from 8am-4/5pm eastern standard time and mostly free weekends so we could play as much or as little as desired	t5_2rfus	True

First, if you can get in some 3 man+ Rift runs, then do that, you will knock out rep very quickly that way.


However, another great way to quickly gain that Rep is to speed run the Rescue at Nurz Gashu. Here is how I did it:


First, use some of your Mark and Medallions to purchase a 1000 rep increase (or a nice little stack, if you have a lot of Marks)  from the curiosity skirmish vendor.


Using that, when you finish your run you will get 1400 rep instead of 700 upon completion. Then it time to run the Rescue Skirmish in record time, and here is how you do that (and this only works Solo, and maybe Duo):

The first  Torech Naur you come across you fight normally nothing you can do with that one, then progress to the second. Now when you finish of the last mob of the first wave and it is time to attack the  Torech Naur, use an attack that places a bleed. For some classes this is easy, other might need to time their attacks just right. I did it with my guard, so an improved sweeping cut was enough. This bleed effect will actually kill the  Torech Naur before the second wave of trash mobs arrive. Once it drops you can runn tot he next area leaving the Trash mobs behind, and they will not aggro UNLESS your Skirmish soldier gets their attention. So its a good idea to know how you Soldier Stands in relation to you and orient them away form the enemy's direction.


At the 3rd Torech Naur you do the same thing, fight the first trash wave, and then use your bleed attack. But this time you should run off the platform to the north west corner (as far as you can go) Since this Torech Naur has 3 waves the other 2 waves will come, possibly from both sides, however they will end up passibg you my if you hide in that corner and they end up on the platform. Once the Torech Naur vleeds out the remaining 2 times and drops, the door will open and you can just sneak in without gaining trash mob aggro, again same notes for the Soldier apply.


Finish the Instance as normal wash rinse repeat. The good news is that doing this per run at level will get you pretty much enough Marks and Medallions to purchase more rep tomes from the skirm vendors, so you can break even.


Anyway, I know that rep is time consuming and having ways to shave off time is always beneficial."	t5_2rfus	True
1372888489.0	1hlfqk	How is LotRO from a single-player aspect, or at the very least, a casual aspect?	RetiredGoonie	19	2	23	"I played LotRO when it originally launched, as I was looking for an alternative to WoW. Much like any other MMO that came out in the past 6 years, I basically played it for a few months and returned to WoW. 

These days, I've quit WoW and have been just trying to catch up on games that have come out that I've missed, but I noticed LotRO on /r/gamedeals today and was wondering how its been. 

I'm not really looking for the typical MMO experience. If I reinvested into LotRO it would be to enjoy the story line, mostly by myself, and probably occasionally doing group work.

Would you folks recommend LotRO for this or would it be a waste of money to only play casually and mostly by myself? 

Bonus question: are the servers basically ghost towns or do enough people play LotRO that it feels relatively alive?

* Captains/LMs cannot use pets when mounted

* 75 to 85 should be considerably longer than 65 to 75

* New full armor sets will be available in the new crafting tiers

* Warsteeds are 2-3x faster than normal steeds

* Mounted combat may be included in instances later

If you have your craft maxed through **EASTEMNET** and make each symbol when the cool down is up your weekly XP earned: 79,000

If you are up to date on your crafting it should take you **2.4 weeks** to max guild reputation. 

**NOTE**: You can purchase reputation boosts from the skirmish camps. This will DOUBLE the XP for each symbol used towards the guild as long as you have enough points in your double XP bar located all the way at the bottom of the reputation panel. 

Please let me know if you see any incorrect math or any other issues with this. Thanks!

Thanks to a very generous subscriber, the mod team has been given a number of TP codes for the release of RoR (how much TP has yet to be determined.) I've decided to give mine away as part of a contest. I was thinking something along the lines of the first person to hit 85 (if we're thinking short term) or perhaps the first person to rebuild Hytbold in its entirety. If you guys have any ideas, post them down below and we'll see what we can get going. It's quite possible we'll have more than one code to give out and once we know the amount we'll be sure to update with that.

Best,

Funkentelechy

1339966619.0	v6x8x	Will Turbine do something for the launch of The Hobbit ?	Poustache	14	1	8	"This question has certainly been asked many times, and while we're all focused on the launch of the Rohan expansion attention has been put away, but the new movie The Hobbit is scheduled for release in December this year, so should we expect that Turbine would do something to tie-in to that event in LOTRO ?

The Lord of the Rings Online has initially been signed on the rights of the LOTR books, and not movies. But since then, Turbine has been bought by Warner Bros., a movie and media company which happens to be the distributor of The Hobbit, so they could probably more easily get the rights of this new movie as well...

That said, LOTRO already has some tie-ins to The Hobbit (the book), as we can see the goblin cavern or Mirkwood for example. What type of content could Turbine provide ? Does it have any good potential ? Would you prefer Turbine to release a Mirkwood-sized mini-expansion for LOTRO or move forward to release the remaining part of the Rohan ?"	t5_2rfus	True

With the influx of subscribers, however, we have also noticed a significant increase in the number of reported posts. If you do report a post, please send the mods a message with a link to the submission as well as an explanation for reporting it. Many of the reports are seemingly random and clog up the moderation queue.

With that being said, thanks everyone for contributing. If you have any suggestions for the subreddit or wish to see something added, let us know down below.

I started playing this game 3-4 days ago and am absolutely loving this game. I'm level 24 at the moment and finishing up Bree-Land, trying to get all the deeds done before I move onto the Lone-Lands. 

I've have nearly 20 titles, and a ton of Yule Festival items and more to come I'm sure. I started playing with two friends, but they ended up quitting two days ago. I talked to them all the time on Skype and it really made the game fun. I'm not particularly a fan of playing games by myself, socialization makes the game less of a grind and generally it's just more fun for me.

I'm looking for a kinship or group of people who actively use voice communication. Not necessarily for one determined goal, but because they like to chat about the game and other general stuff.

1311254285.0	ivsjl	Class Hints	Natefil	16	5	35	"I've played LOTRO since the beta (more heavily after the moria expansion) and thought I would offer a few key points of advice I've found helpful for various classes. I have a lvl 65 Captain, Burglar, Rune Keeper and Warden but I've lead enough raids to know the basics (and tricks) to most of the classes.

Here's some advice on a few of the classes that you may find helpful:

**Burglar:** 


1. Addle after a flashing blades will remove the remainder of the attack animation while instantly applying the damage. Basically, what that does is streamline your dps because you don't have to wait for the long animation to finish.

2. 5 deep in Quiet Knife is all you need for 90% of the grouped content. Pair QK with traited counter defense and you have yourself a consistent crit chain. Also note, traited counter defense is LOVE by captains and champs, it does wonders for both. Gambler is good if done properly, practice it thoroughly before grouping, timing is everything. Remember that you can let a regular gamble almost drop off before hitting Gambler's Strike and popping it to max tier and resetting the gamble's timer. 

3. Burglar armor is really up to your liking. I go with moria over the helegrod because of the stats.

**Captain:** 

1. GET 4 PIECES OF THE HELEGROD GEAR! It is extremely important. You don't need more than four, in fact I have never run with 6 deep in the set but if you pair the helegrod 4 piece bonus with the legacy for Rallying Cry CD you have a 6 second rallying cry. In instances where you have lots of mobs dying you'll easily outheal a minstrel or rune keeper. 

2. That brings me to my second point. The most important legacy on an emblem is Rallying Cry Cooldown. Without the legacy the emblem is worthless. The order of importance for legacies goes: Rallying Cry CD, Vocal Skills Healing, Rallying Cry Healing (those are the three that are necessary). Strength of Will healing is necessary but put it on a separate emblem and switch to it when you need to apply the shield brother buff. 

3. For a weapon, To Arms is HIGHLY underused. Get the legacy and use it every time it's not on CD. The three most important weapon legacies are Telling Mark damage, To Arms (this should be maxed), and Pressing Attack Targets. 

4. Switching shield brothers will separate a great captain from a good captain. Put shield brother on the tank, switch emblems to your Strength of Will emblem (should not be on your main healing one), apply Strength of Will (be patient before switching back, an early switch can cost you the buff or the emblem bonus), remove shield brother from your tank, apply shield brother to your main dps (if single target: rk or hunter, if aoe: champ), apply to arms, keep it on your dps target and wait to reapply To Arms the second time then switch shield brothers back to your tank and repeat.

5. If you like going into the moors: Do Not Trait Oathbreakers. It is not that useful and when I'm on my warleader I'll just bubble the target I see that on. Shield of the Dunedain with the legacy for the cool down is awesome. Get it, use it, love it. It saves lives.

**Minstrel**

1. This is going to be from an observational standpoint as this is the class that I've spent the least time on. First, a minstrel needs to have gear. From a purely healing standpoint the Helegrod gear is fantastic. +5% outgoing healing is tough to match. The OD gear is good in both regards, if you want dps all you need is 3 of the pieces for that set. For healing I'd recommend going for the full five because of the five piece bonus.

2. Underused Skills: *Call to Greatness:* The benefit from this is unmeasurable when applied to a captain during a particularly difficult phase of combat. If you have the 5 piece bonus for the healing oriented OD gear then everyone get's their individual Call to Greatness buff and your fellowship's effectiveness will be dramatically improved. *Song of Aid:* Before a fight starts or during a rough phase put this out. The champs who are in ardour will be able to activate ardent flurry (-20% attack duration) and captains will be able to get off a Rallying Cry if the group needs heals or a War Cry if the group needs dps. *Ballad of War:* GET THIS LEGACY! +20% damage for melees is monstrous. I can't overstate the impact that makes. 

3. Traits: I get frustrated when minstrels trait Enduring Morale when healing. It only provides 260 morale and there are much better legacies to use. I recommend trying out a 4 yellow, 3 blue healing trait setup as you get the bonus for tale of warding if needed. I've also seen effective 4 blue, 3 yellow minstrels (the capstone for blue line is meh). 

4. Minstrels in DPS: You are effective and can blow things up very quickly but trust me, from a parsing standpoint the RK will beat you very quickly. If you do enjoy dpsing get the 3 piece OD set for dps, it's fantastic.

5. Healing in the moors is very different from healing in PvE. Utilize your low to no induction skills in the moors, you will be targetted, get used to running, flopping and fleeing to the champs. 

**Rune Keeper**

1. Essence of Winter is one of the most underused skills from a damage standpoint. On a regular hit it does 3 times as much as your ceaseless or scribes spark and hits three targets. On a crit it matches the damage for those skills with their critical multipliers.

2. Annuminas gear is not worth it. Don't feel bound to an armor set for a bonus, none of them are really worth it. The moria gear is good because of the essense of winter targets but it's difficult to get it from a rank standpoint and from a farming standpoint. Find the gear that gives you the best stats in an individual slot and use that. Rider's Leggings are a good example.

3. Fire damage is useless, don't invest in it. I've had a lvl 65 first age that was pure fire damage (not by choice). It's contingent on the fight being against a single target, you not needing to move (at all) and the boss not wiping bleeds and dots. VERY VERY few fights are like that. Lightning does more damage anyway.

4. RKs are great healers but it's about predictive healing. The tank will get the first bit of aggro so stack up a few mending verses on him but then expect the champ (if there is one) to pull aggro for a short period of time, so stack up some mending verses before the champ even grabs the mobs for that brief interval. Fates Entwined is OP and if you are able to get any of the Ost Dunhoth gear then go towards the healing set because it makes Fates Entwined 50% more effective.

**Wardens**

1. The Warden is a tough class to master. Personally, I feel it got an undue nerf when Enedwaith came out but that's up for debate. The trick to a warden is about fully utilizing the Masteries, dancing between BPE boosts, threat leaches and self heals. 

2. My two favorite legacies are War Cry Threat and Exultation of Battle Threat. It has been argued that the increase is small but I'll take a small amount of threat gained over none at all.

3. Wardens gain threat as the fight goes on, for this reason expect to lose early aggro to a champ or LM who goes Ents go to War and Lightning Storm. Convictions can mean that you can take a group that's going all out together. If you have 4 people who are maximizing their threat through healing and dps your convictions are that much more effective in their leeches. 

4. Gearwise there isn't much that is pivotal for Wardens. The Helegrod gear is fairly nice for spars while the OD (Javelin) gear is great for tanking. A well crafted warden can sit at about 8k health unbuffed if they have the right legacies. 

5. Currently, I'm in a debate with Edmann (another warden) concerning the usefulness of the Spear Mastery. My thought is that for fights with lots of small mob pulls the additional threat from running two yellow line can ensure more aggro for you. You lose a small amount of self heals and perhaps your parry gambit but those two things don't matter if the champ is the one with all of the threat. For single bosses run with the spear mastery. 

6. Don't underestimate the value of your virtues. Innocence, Discipline, Zeal, Tolerance, Fidelity, Honour. The Mitigations provided by those are invaluable for many end game runs.

If this type of thing is helpful for anyone I can make some similar guides for minstrels, guards, lms and wardens. "	t5_2rfus	True

**DAMN THE KIN IS AWESOME!!!**

Here is the thing. I was founder of a level 10 kin on my other server. I sort of fell away from playing (you know we all take breaks from time to time) and others were running it. I would log in MAYBE once a month for a few hours but just couldn't get back into the game... 

 I think the problem was it was your normal pick up kin. Anyone welcome. Lots of people who because it was a pick up kin didn't give a fuck about each other... no feeling of community, of family, if you know what I mean....

 So then I came here, just to try it out...I mean..cause I am a redditor..and what the hell.. it might be fun..

 Truthfully I joined at the worst time. In America (I am American but I live in Japan) you were all just getting busy with real life. College students were cramming for finals. Holiday season. A shit load of new games had just dropped (Portal 2, new CoD, blah blah). Not a lot was going on. Runs were happening about 2 times a week on the weekends. Even on North American Up Time there was only 4 to 5 people online on the weekdays. Weekends of course were more but still...

 I saw people that I assume were regulars one by one stop coming.. truthfully it was kind of sad... I don't know, maybe like me in my old kin, you just needed a break, or something happened that stopped you from coming, or you got tired of having to PUG to get anything done. 

 ANYWHEW the reason I am posting this is to shout out to all those people who drifted away at that time.. I DARE YOU TO LOG ON! You will freak!!

 I don't know all the reasons but...DAAAAAMMMNNN! **The kin is a busy busy place now!** We are getting 2 to 3 new members a day. The runs are awesome. And can you believe this?!? Yesterday I was watching the kinlist, and we had a full 65 group fellowing at the same time another 40s/50s group were doing their thing and another 20s (or so) group were doing their thing...Not counting the soloing that was going on.

 In one day I got 2 major pieces for Midoringo (6man fellow), ran a raid (so much fun), 4 or 5 runs in a 3man fellow, and had to drop just because I was so tired I could not keep up. **IT'S LIKE FEAST AFTER FAMINE!!!**

So I guess what I want to say is ALL OF YOU WHO DRIFTED AWAY!!! Pop back in and see us again!

**TL;DR The kin is busy busy busy!!! AND I AM LOVIN' IT!!!**

**Casual:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Always initiate the battles.
&gt;* Know your way around the instance.
&gt;* Be aware of your surroundings. (ex: patrols, spawning mobs, etc)
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Never initiate
&gt;* Attack what the tank attacks
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Heal the tank before DPS (if the tank dies, you’ll most likely wipe)

**Hardcore:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Constantly rotate targets landing at least 1 hit on each target
&gt;* AoE as much as possible
&gt;* Make sure to constantly check health bars, if someone is low make sure to taunt the mob
&gt;* Face mob away from the raid
&gt;* If you notice a mob is CC’d near you, move mob pack away to eliminate chance that CC’d mob will be AoE’d
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Know your enemy mobs, if you know that a certain mob is specifically dangerous then kill it (which would overwrite the previous 'attack what the tank attacks' tip)
&gt;* Use Crowd Control (CC) on mobs that are farthest away, or fall into the dangerous category
&gt;* Don’t attack CC’d mobs!!!!
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Keep an eye on debuffs and remove feared effects, diseases, etc
&gt;* Always have HoT’s on DPS that are taking indirect damage (mob AoE)
&gt;* Be healing efficient. If your heal heals for 400 and your target is only missing 200 life, wait until your target is missing 400 so you’re not wasting power.
&gt;* If your heals are HoT, don’t apply the heal again until the HoT is done. Otherwise you’re wasting power.
&gt;* Communicate that you are going to heal a specific party member so that they can conserve potions and other ""o shit spells"" (paraphrased from pri1mu5)
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground

1369060100.0	1ep13p	Is it necessary to complete the Epic Quests?	iBanana32GB	14	4	26	"Can I safely skip Epic Quests, or are there reward that become necessary for the end game?

[According to the lotro wiki page](http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Epic_Quests), you get titles... but it's not very explicit imho whether you are supposed to do these quests or not.

**Update**

Thanks for the very helpful tips.

So to summarize so far (please correct me if I'm wrong):

* It is possible to do only a subset of the *Books* from *Volume* I, II and III.
* Some books provide useful rewards and access to further content (cf. AlucardZero's answer).
* The *Books* do not have to be completed in order, but some that give useful rewards may require previous *Books* from the same *Volume* to be completed.
* However each *Book* individually ([Book 1 Quests](http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Category:Book_1_Quests) example) is a series of quests that need to be completed in order.

Some things I am not clear yet:

* If a quest fails (some of them are buggy), can you can restart from the last quest in the book? For example I was stuck at the last chapter of book 1. Strider was not in his room in Bree. When I cancelled it, it didn't say that I'm on chapter 11, the epic quest just disappeared altogether from my journal. So I am unsure if Tom Bombadil will let me pick up again from completion of Chapter 11, or if I will have to restart Vol 1. Book 1."	t5_2rfus	True

I made a number of changes based on all of your fantastic feedback and had a much more fulfilling experience tonight. It also helped that we were with a really solid tank who knew exactly what was happening.*  

***Thank you all for your excellent suggestions, it gave me a lot to think about and is really appreciated.***

-----

* How do you get through the rough times in LOTRO? 
* What can you do as a bad player to gain worthwhile experience?
* What can you do with a bad group to avoid failure?

Some context for this follows, and I will prefix it by saying that I am not an experienced player. This is perhaps where the issue lies ...  
  

I had a terrible evening in LOTRO today. Using the instance finder, I attempted two runs of Dargnakh tier 1 with different groups. Before this, I had completed the instance exactly once, and I felt that it went poorly, despite it ultimately being a success.  
    
    
The first group contained a Warden, a Minstrel (me) and a Runekeeper. We were awful, we couldn't get past the first wave of adds at Huva. After three or so wipes, we eventually gave up.   
    
    
For the second run we had a Champion, a Minstrel (me again) and a Hunter. We made it to Dargnakh this time, DPS'd him down to 100k or so, and then wiped. We switched our strategy slightly and tried again as we agreed that it felt possible. Unfortunately, we couldn't hold it together and we wiped a second time. We eventually disbanded after ""nice try""s were passed around and the champ suggested that we get a real tank (in a helpful sort of way).  


I was then left, by myself, in an empty instance with only the final boss left to kill. I contemplated calling out on GLFF for a quick group to get a few seals, but my confidence was so knocked that I didn't think I could pull it off.  


With the first group, I felt partly responsible for our failure, but not directly. It was just a bad group. The tank had returned to play with the Warden changes and really didn't know what he was doing. With the second group, I felt entirely at fault. Although we didn't have a ""real"" tank, the champ was very experienced. I just couldn't keep him healed throughout the final fight. On both tries with this group, during Dargnakh's third rage, we would wipe.   


After the second group disbanded, I closed the game, feeling entirely disappointed with myself.  


I perhaps shouldn't feel responsible for the failures, but I do. I really feel that I've wasted people's time and have left them feeling frustrated (although this was never expressed in either group).  


I pug very rarely on my Minstrel and feel that, at best, I do an ""okay"" job of keeping everyone healed. My character is fairly under-geared, which is hurting my confidence, and to make matters worse, my play time is limited.  


I love my Minstrel, when all goes well, healing a group is incredibly rewarding. I also adore LOTRO, the community in particular is what keeps me playing. However, being left with this feeling of failure is not enjoyable and it's not something I can continue to subject myself to.  


I would imagine that any responses will be along the lines of ""forget it, pugs are like that"", or ""group with people who know their class"", but I'm really looking for advice on how to move past the feeling of failure when things go poorly. Is it ever possible to coordinate a messy group after multiple wipes?  


**tl;dr How can I get good healing and leadership experience as a Minstrel without failing all the time?**

 I had some free time and thought I would give it a go. Truth be told, I thought it would be a waste of TP. (I know you can get it also at Skirmish camps for marks but I was in the middle of nowhere and didn't feel like running back.)

 So, for 100 TP you get a token in your bags. When you click the token 60 mins appear on the clock under the new  SS IU. If you can't see the UI, right click your character iu to bring it out. The clock **does not** start until you bring out your SS.

 You can bring out your SS by right clicking the UI or your Skimish horn in your quick slots. You can dismiss just as any pet by clicking the SS and choose dismiss.

 **When you dismiss the clock stops.**

 Ok, mechanics out of the way...how was it?

 **Awesome**

 So I never realized how much running and standing we do in this game, but actual fighting is not so much. 

 For this little trial I used it on my Captain in Edinwaith (sp?). I only pulled him out when I needed extra dps (I use an archer, so with my captain archer I had 2 dps pets.) 

 For regular mobs it was just me and archer 1. Then in the first area that nasty Shadow wolf cave quest came up....(dun dun dunnnnn)
I walk in the cave and, oh gee, an elite is passing infront of me..

 I just had time to horn in Archer 2 (You can't call them while in combat) and off we ...what? he is dead already???
WOW!!! Fuck running away, I just looped around the whole place, killing everything as I came to it. 4 elites, all the wolves, and I got all the torches in 13 mins. Cool.

 Outside I just used the SS on hard mobs (bulls, elites, bosses). After each mob died I would dismiss.

 Total time played:   3 &amp; 1/2 hours.

 Total time used from SS clock: 24 minutes

 Gained levels: 2

I thought it would be interesting to take a toon 
**from start to finish**
 to see if the problem was all the quests we ran back when the level cap was 65.

I skipped all group quests. (Didn't even do Grand Stairs)

I skipped most of the epic line.

I skipped all 'pick up daisies, carry things' quests.

I didn't grind any traits or run any skirms.

I **did** use destiny points to keep my xp bar blue.

The only grind I did was one hour in Sarnur to finish the last rep level to get a goat for Moria.

**drumroll**

I was Level 70 when I hit Dunland. All quests are light blue or green. Wights in the bonevale place are all green...

I am almost to 72 just by doing the first 2 entryway quest lines...

so...yeah...it's made for new toons more than old....

1321903151.0	mkgew	How does LOTRO compare to other MMOs?	tensegritydan	13	1	15	"This [poor review of TOR beta](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/mk7hv/the_old_republic_drops_nda_one_player_gives_his/) got me thinking how LOTRO stacks up, especially against WoW or TOR (at least the beta).

I love LOTRO--gameplay, open world, story, community, etc--but I haven't played other recent MMOs, so I have no basis to compare it.

So how do you think LOTRO stacks up? Is the gameplay outdated (e.g., WoW circa 2005)? How's the graphics/visuals holding up?

With Isengard right around the corner, it seems like a perfect time to go back through some of the existing content that (as a kin), we haven't spent much time with.  As such, I wanted to see how much interest there would be in me organizing kin runs of older group content.  I'm thinking of running a raid or two, maybe adding in some of the rarer Moria instances.  


I've felt for a while the kin could use someone to organize group content.  We've finally reached enough higher-level classes that we can attempt (and have a reasonable chance of succeeding at) several of the existing raids.  I'm willing to do the work and learn the strategies needed for each one and take charge of organizing everything, but I'd like to make sure there's sufficient interest in the kin first.


What does everyone think?  Would you be interested in attempting some all-kin (or majority-kin) runs of raid content like the Rift, Helegrod, and the Watcher and some instances like Dark Delvings, Lost Temple, and Sâri-surma?"	t5_2rfus	True

I started a brand new guard and have been leveling happily since, without once checking the Lotro store. Then yesterday evening I checked mylotro just out of curiosity and noticed a 530+ balance out of the blue. Dumbfounded, checking transaction history, it turns out that my old acc recieved 500 TP under a label of something like COG_transition_leftover. I only had a free account before, and I got no idea if this is normal. Browsing through the transition faqs didn't reveal that any TP gifts are awarded to anyone.

But, happy news indeed, free 500 tp is akin to say, completing all  reputation deeds and then some, or almost equal to doing Shire-Ered luin-Bree zone-deeds. That's a lot, yay!

And then the Priestesses and the Giant show up.  The Giant actually isn't a big deal for me (pun not intentional), since he goes down like a chump if I can get a couple good Light-Oil arrows into him.  Unfortunately, the Priestesses have usually killed Lorniel the Limitlessly Incompetent by that point.

It's not due to anything else on the mini-map covering the red dot/arrow, either. I can try to track a mob right in front of me and still won't get the giant red dot for it. Is this a known bug that's crept into the game since I played last? "	t5_2rfus	True

Each server has its very own economy that is determined by the players who play there. The supply and demand of each type of item can vary greatly depending on the playerbase's needs and accessibility.

To make myself more clear, I am inquiring about the prices of in game items on each server. I am curious as to what the average price of key items are and how it varies from server to server. My server of Arkenstone is what I would consider a ""blue-collar"" server where most of the playerbase is end game, raid focused. This, according to my hypothesis, will mean that key items are cheaper as they are more accessible. A server that has more lower (non level 75) level players may have a higher average cost for key items.

Let us compare our servers' prices in terms of selling values on the Auction House, here are the approximate averages for key items on **Arkenstone**:

* Cracked Rhi Helvarch Sigil - ~8g
* Worn Symbol of Celebrimbor - ~20g
* Level 75 2nd Age LI - ~40-45g
* Draigoch's Scale - ~200-400g
* Worn Symbol of the Elder King - ~600g
* Level 70-75 Steel-bound Lootbox - ~60g
* Star-lit Crystal - ~50g

I believe these will be enough to gauge the differences (if there are any) between the different servers. Now I understand that the economy on any given server can change at any given moment for whatever reason. Currently, Arkenstone is in an inflation for Worn Symbols of Celebrimbor due to the fact that all of them were bought off the Auction House at one time so the demand is high for them (price is at an average of ~50g at the moment).

So, I am curious as to what are the general prices of the items I listed, and if I forgot anything that would be note worthy please let me know!

I spent this morning searching for what I was missing - an MMO to play!  I played WoW from Vanilla till Cata and have since quit for the past year or so.  I played a lot of D2 (loved it) and some D3, which I found disappointing as there's no community aspect to it at all.  For those that know it, I have been on/off from Ragnarok Online since I was in middle school (25 now).  That game had little story or quests (with any backstory) and was a total grindfest.  Didn't mind because the community was awesome and fun to hang with.  

Upon reading some on F2P MMO's, and not being opposed to busting out the wallet every now and a again for perks, I came across LOTRO.  Reading [this particular thread of comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/vrsre/is_it_safe_to_say_that_this_game_is_a_care_bear/) inspired me to look more into it and create this post!  What advice would y'all like to have known when starting out?  Should I play the game ""vanilla"" for a few weeks to get a feel?  Should I get UI mods right away?  Should I be making spreadsheets for my character to min-max myself into perfection?  Should I make a farming class first and then a support class to find groups easier?  (Meaning as a DPS would I ever find a group to level with and/or dungeon with)  What realm should I choose?  I have a lot of questions, but don't feel the need to address everything.

I know I'm not the only person in the kin, but I wanted to talk a bit about my feelings, and what I'd like to attempt to do to maybe resolve some things about our kin.

I don't play anymore.  At all.  The update just made me lose interest, and a large number of other games came out that I'm interested in, and I don't see my interest in LOTRO ever coming back full-tilt like it once was.  I don't see myself sitting down and playing it every night for hours on end.

That being said, I do miss the kin, we had a lot of laughs and a lot of fun together, and I'd like to at least feed that camaraderie.  So how about either one night a week, or a couple times a month, pick some dates, and we all sign on and play like old times... I never really wanted the kin to be a 'schedule &amp; play this day' type of clan, but honestly I'll never play if I don't sign on and see others on.

With the new 'instance finder' we should be able to say ""let's all sign on at 10pm EST 1st and 3rd Monday nights of the month"" and by 10:05pm, we have our Raid/Fellowship together, and go do something, and pull in PUGs if need be.  Or help a lower level kinmate out if so desired (CARN DUM!?!) 

On a side note:  I've just been promoting Officers as I see fit lately, since I'm never on.  If you would like to be 'advertised' on the right panel as someone to get in touch with to join the kin, please say so and I'll update the info panel.

For those of you new to LOTRO, festivals are a seasonal event that take place in Bree, Thorin's Hall, and The Shire. You can win festival tokens which you can redeem for consumables (fireworks, bread that summons birds to 'scare' a player, smack a player, etc.), cosmetics, learn new emotes, and mounts.

If you're a low level character and are still using a starter mount or no mount at all, you can win the horse races (held in both Bree and The Shire) and get horse tokens and trade them into the stable master at Hengstacer's Farm in Bree.

If you haven't been to all of these places and are on the Gladden server, I'd be more than happy to show you around / muster you to new locations so you can participate.

Also, in the spirit of this season, The Shire has a seasonal haunted house area in which you can possibly (random chance) of winning a [Skeleton Horse](http://www.lotrosteeds.com/imgbin/horse-fallskeletal.jpg) for free that I highly suggest playing through as it's a lot of fun!"	t5_2rfus	True

Anyways, we realized this maybe a bit late after already playing a great deal on the Riddermark server (all have level 20+s and I have a level 40 who I am not willing to part with).  I started a kinship by the name of The Sterling Archers so that eventually we can get a kinship house (pretty much shared storage, yea?) and also make it easier for us to do things while playing.  Sadly, we do not have enough people to keep the kin (within a few days it will be disbanded automatically due to lack of people).  So I ask you, fellow redditors, WILL YOU HELP US?

I sent them a message about including the kinship I am in, and would like to tell all of the possible new comers to this game about Knights of the White Lady. 

You can reach our website here: http://kwl.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=169873&amp;TabID=1438087

Below is the text from the front page.  

The Knights of the White Lady (KWL or KotWL) is a guild on the Landroval server for Lord of the Rings Online. Our in-game address is 1 High Road, Highdore, Bree-Land. We are a group of mature (18+) individuals who enjoy being in a friendly and close-knit environment, a place where people of all backgrounds and sexual orientations (gay, straight, bi or transgender) can feel at home.

KWL is LOTRO's largest and best-organized gay / LGBT-friendly guild. It does not limit recruitment to LGBT people, but the guild aggressively enforces an environment that is supportive of them. The guild does not emphasize a play style such as ""roleplaying"" or otherwise, but is accepting of all play styles.

The guild is named in honor of Eowyn, White Lady of Rohan.

We chose Eowyn as a role model because of the way she rode to battle pretending to be a man, and had to later ""come out"" as a woman before defeating the Witch-King of Angmar. The guild's founder thought her bravery to be analogous to how gay people often have to hide who they are for a time before accepting themselves and coming out to society. She was therefore considered to be appropriate as the inspiration for the guild's name.

If you think you might like to join us, feel free to read through our guild information section. Our admissions article will guide you through the application process. We hope to see you soon!"	t5_2rfus	True

1308929952.0	i84zs	Trying to find a class that fits me...experienced opinions solicited inside!	Henry_the_Butler	12	1	39	"I'll try to keep this brief. First I'll describe myself as a player, then I'll talk about what I'm hoping some of these classes would offer me.

I've got a MoM key that I loaded on the account, so I have all the classes unlocked. I have a strong leaning away from men, not a huge fan of hobbits, love the dwarves and elves. (not sure why)

As a player in MMOs, I love the utility roles of the game over pure DPS. I find it a lot more interesting to CC, debuff, tank, or heal during an encounter rather than just burn things to the ground.

However, I want to enjoy my solo experience on the way to level cap. This means I don't want a class that would be frustrating to solo with. Low DPS is not as frustrating to me as the inability to deal with a 3 mob pull would be. I want options in combat, even solo combat.

Here are my main contenders for a good class for me, I'd appreciate feedback on them:

1) Rune-Keeper - allows for my DPS and solo power, but can fill a healing role in groups to be interesting and flexible. I hear it gets less toys while DPSing...so that's a concern, since it may make for a 1 dimensional character while soloing. Am I worried for no reason?

2) Minstrel - Solid group character, healing is fun for me in groups so that's a plus. How does it do solo? I hear it does decent DPS, but is the fear enough to allow it to handle the tougher 3 pulls or elites solo?

3) Lore Master - solid choice imo...DPS-ish character who has CC, pets, and lots of toys. I'm pretty sure I'll end up with one of these, but I'm open to hearing details.

4) Guardian - I like the durable types, so this one goes here. I imagine the self-heals they get should allow them to handle largeish pulls relatively well...but how is their solo DPS at lower levels before you get the higher tier DPS toys?

5) hunter - I hear this guy is boring more than anything else...which worries me. Some say however that it's a great class that doesn't have many toys during combat, but has lots of non-combat toys to make up for it. Traps seem interesting...are they useful for things besides kiting?

6) Burglar - Solid debuff class...I normally don't like melee DPS, but I've heard really good things about burgs from people who love them. Seems like soloing may be frustrating a touch because of the inability to do fellowship maneuvers or get positional DPS increases while solo.

7) Captain - Seems like it could be interesting, but a bit slow...great for groups, but my dislike for melee DPS is coming out...unless this class gets glowing recommendations I'll probably ignore it.

8) Champion - again, I don't like melee DPS...I'll just move on here.

TL:DR - I'm trying to find a fun class to solo with, and soliciting opinions on what you find fun and why. I have a strong leaning toward classes that get tricksy stuff and fight at range.

Is there any reason why this game runs so bad on Windows 7?  I have a relatively new system with all updates installed.  I've gotten several crashes already.  The last of which required a hard reboot (could not access the task manager).

Is it possible to track 2 things at once, such as wood and ore?  It looks like several vocations have 2 gathering professions.

Is there a shortcut to sell things directly from your bag, instead of the ""sell"" panel on vendors?  My issue is that the sell panel isn't sorted and I have to look through many things to find what I want to sell, where in my bags, all my junk is together, all my supplies are in another bag, etc.

Not to mention, if I do get into a group and I suck, it may be even more difficult to get into future groups.

If you're still working on your maps, now's the time to get out there and slaughter every mob you encounter. (Sigils of Battle can be traded for maps or skins at your racial barter vendor in Grams. Greater Sigils can be traded for traits or skins at same racial barter vendor.)

According to http://lux-hdro.de/hdro-live-dwarrowdelf.php, server peaks at about 2000 players, while others barely get into the 800s. Archet is instanced due to the large amount of players. I haven't gotten to Bree yet on Dwarrowdelf, but... damn.. leave my resources alone!

* Virtues have been raised to 16

* Native Mac OS X client is being tested (:D)

* Outgoing healing, tactical/physical mastery caps have been increased

* Mob debuffs such as fears and poisons (-125 will/vit) now expire after a few seconds out of combat instead of the full duration (&gt;1m)

* Skirmish trait caps have been increased

* We should see an increase in overall performance (e.g. less lag), [according to Sapience](http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?475957-Official-Discussion-Beta-Tester-Impressions-of-Riders-of-Rohan/page2)

I hope this doesn't catch on in other servers, it really sucks all the fun out of the moors and the game in general. The only way to really get it situated is for the community to speak up.

re: Shire Housing Organization - Step Two
by Kiralynn of Rohan on 2012/07/13 1:11
Greetings! 

 It is time to organize a new kin neighborhood! What is a kin neighborhood, you ask? It is a place where all of the houses are owned by members of the LMB. Why is that awesome? All of the yards and homes will be nicely decorated. A large number of chests will be shared, full of donated items. You'll have a place to drop off your own donations. You will have a button that lets you teleport to your friend's houses when it's time to roleplay and party. Neighbors will notice if you need furniture and will help you decorate. They'll also help you with maintenance if you are called away from the game for an extended period. 

 There are currently four official LMB neighborhoods - Imrath Ivrin in Falathlorn, Oldfurlong in the Shire, Raglan in Bree-land, and Hliflak in Thorin's Hall. Although a number of LMB members live elsewhere, those are public/informal neighborhoods. 

 You can move into this new neighborhood whether you are buying new house or relocating from another neighborhood. We ask that if you are moving out of an official kin neighborhood (Imrath Ivrin, Oldfurlong, Raglan or Hliflak) that you give us warning before you leave the old address, so that another LMB member can buy it, keeping the neighborhood kin-only. 

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 Here is a general outline of how we go about founding another kin neighborhood: 

 1) We find out which housing area the most people want to move into. This time we'll be establishing a new home in the Shire. (Next time, another area.) 

 2) We post a list of available addresses. Everyone replies to the post requesting the address (or addresses) they would like to purchase. 

 3) If two people want the same address, they try to work it out. If they cannot, the address is assigned to one of the people requesting it. (We want to avoid conflicts on move-in day.) 

 4) When all of the deluxe and most of the standard houses are spoken for, or have volunteers willing to hold them, we start watching the housing count. When there are only 1 to 3 houses left before a new neighborhood spawn, we schedule a move-in day. We warn everyone that this is an estimated date, and to watch the forums closely in case we announce an early move-in. 

 5) People who are moving out of other neighborhoods to join the kin neighborhood sell their existing property to get ready for the move. 

 6) Hopefully, we create the new neighborhood ourselves by having someone buy the last available house on move-in day. When all houses of one type are gone, the system automatically and immediately generates 3 new neighborhoods. We pick one of them and announce the name. Once in a while, somebody else causes the new neighborhoods to be created, so we make an emergency announcement for an immediate move-in. 

 7) Everyone buys the house they signed up for on the master list. We ask everyone to give Harperella and Lennidhren maintenance permissions on the house, full permissions if they are willing. (It is a good idea to give the whole kinship maintenance permission.) 

 8) Everyone who buys a house updates their Address Book entry here in the forums. 

 9) Decoration Donation week begins. Banders visit the new neighborhood, dropping off free decorations to everyone who set Kinship decorating permissions on their house(s). 

 10) We hold a Neighborhood Party to welcome everyone to the newly decorated area. This usually includes music, a horse show, yard games, fireworks, and free ale and pipeweed for everyone! 

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 To sign up, reply to this post with the address (or list of addresses) that you would like to purchase in the new neighborhood. Please include your first, second, and third choice of address(es). I will put an asterisk (*) next to a home that has someone asking for it as a first-choice, and a plus (+) next to a home that someone has requested as a second/third choice. You can still request any address that you like."	t5_2rfus	True

and their rival **[The Ale Association](http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Ale_Association)** of the Dwarves which is also all about getting drunk too and hell-bent on destroying the Inn League for not involving them.

Both yield nice rewards. The inn league yields more decors + cosmetics &amp; the Ale Association is (aside from the Treasure Hunt event) the easiest way to get a nice goat mount. (Can't ride horses in Moria, only goats).

It's possible to do them without horses, but of course, easier with.

But yea the epic questline isn't exactly filling up the XP bar. I've seen Eregion goes from 48-53 and I may try that. But are there some better options I'm not exploring? (ie when does the Mines of Moria expansion content come into play and how do i access it?)

Update: Got the eregion QP as i realized i would have been forgoing all the black ash wood i needed. Farmed up to 50, got a ton of wood, and now im back in Moria.

Update, first blood part 2: 51 now. In Moria now. Moria sucks. I can't mount. You have to fight your way into and out of every little quest objective. (ie, fight 20 minutes to get to the supply crates, 20 minutes gathering, 20 minutes fighting your way back out).

1296512862.0	fco0w	Lets Create a Kinship Character/Crafting Reference List!		12	3	18	"Hi, /r/lotro.

I want to make a reference list for the Kinship. I'm looking for two things:

1. Association of mains/alts to a single person. This will obviously help players associate in-game characters to a single person. It can be confusing when players, like our beloved Dymebag, have 5 characters and it's unclear which ones belong to him. 

2. What everyone brings to the table. The crafting system is setup to encourage interdependence of Kinship members to progress. It would be good to have, with everyone's character list, a note on which professions one has collectively across one's characters, and the skill level of each. 

Edit:

**Oncogene**

1. Odhan - Master Cook/Master Farmer. I currently have recipes to make food for up-to level 50 players. 

2. Morvornir - Artisan Weaponsmith/Artisan Prospector. I can make swords/axes/maces/halberds for (currently) up to level 38 characters. 

**reddownthere**

   1. Dymebag-Supreme Woodworker
   2. Kennyth-Master Weaponsmith
   3. Luthorius-Supreme Scholar(but can't crit it yet) (Main?)
   4. Gamoldan-Master Jeweller
   5. Thorkrell-Journeyman Metalsmith

I also have another character (Obamadalf), but he doesn't have any professions.

**Rockerpult**

1. Rockan -A few points off Master Expert Cook (Main). 
2. Lindzay -Journeyman Woodworker. 

**Leading_Man_Parts**

1. Datson - Supreme Weaponsmith
2. Wattson-1 - Supreme Metalsmith

**6Kings**

1. Tolumfast - Supreme Master Farmer 

**mrshll**

1. Danranduun - Expert Tailor, can make noob light/medium armor up to 31. Feel free to message me from new toons.
2. Andmy - Big dumb tank, aspiring metalworker.

**pr1mu5**

1. Johnathyn - King Pope Tailor

**Agent Asterisk**

1. Bindgrim - Expert Tailor/Prospector, Artisan Forester

**godofallcows**

1. DerpHerp- novice everything, destroyer of worlds, main trait: uselessness.

**quagmeyer**

I have a house full that play on 4 accounts but these are the main crafters - if any of these toons are caught wandering aimlessly and have no clue what's going on it's probably me.

   1. Kamorin (main) - Woodworker - Supreme Kindred
   2. Holdsworth - Scholar - Supreme Kindred
   3. Tardian - Tailor - Supreme Kindred
   4. RenamedOff - Jeweller Supreme Kindred, Supreme Cook
   5. Fatsoman - Metalworker Supreme (1 wk or so to Kindred)
   6. Yoweow - Weaponsmith (Master)

**tensegritydan**

1. Derpiel. Probably not worth listing that she is novice in historian professions.
2. Herpo

**Lord_Byron**

1. Olofire: Supreme Jeweller (Main)
2. Oloshield: Expert Metalsmith
3. Oloric: Woodworker, Weaponsmith (not currently leveling him though)

1370383467.0	1foilc	I need help. I'm an altoholic.	badcall	10	1	12	"I now have 15 toons spread across 3 different servers: 3 of them are completely unused on Arkenstone, 5 are on Vilya and though they haven't been touched in quite some time (maybe a year), they have some substance to them, and I now have 7 on Brandywine.

I enjoy Brandywine the most so far as there seems to be a decent balance between low-level and high level players. I also enjoy my toons most on this server and find myself striving to remain active in the Lotro community. I love the festivals, I love the little things in Lotro (cute written dialogues, smoking good pipeweed, talking with random people, helping others, giving out random mats, etc.), and I love crafting. I've got an itch for grinding, I suppose.

I also love every class, minus burglar (haven't played it yet, somehow). I have a Man/Warden/Woodsman, Elf/Hunter/Explorer, Man/Cappy/Metalsmith, Dwarf/Champ/Armsman, Elf/LM/Scholar, Elf/RK/Tinkerer, and a Dwarf/Guard/Yeoman, the last which I enjoy a lot.

* I genuinely enjoy hunter - it's the first class I ever played and killing things is generally fun.

* Cappy is awesome, so versatile and useful, I like how he does a little bit of everything.

* I love my Guard right now and basically just use OP the whole time - I feel about as powerful as a champ.

* RK is awesome and maybe the best class in the game in my mind, I love the high amount of damage + mobility he has plus how much heals over time he can put out.* 

* I enjoy the challenge that LM gives me and want to see what one can really do late game.

* My Warden is the class I've progressed through the game with the most though pretty much exclusively with a friend who's a minstrel. While everyone talks about how difficult Warden is, I find him really easy and natural to use, though I haven't really memorized all the gambits up through level 46. :|   I only have like 4 or 5 go-to gambits and try to at least remember combinations that work, so I don't just throw anything at an enemy. I'm not getting rid of him anytime soon.

* Champ is fun, not much else to say about glorified heavy sustain melee dps with hardly any inductions.

* *I'm pretty sure I have a minstrel somewhere on these three servers and I remember the class being awesome. Perfect blend of ranged dps, buffs, heals, and an option for medium armour. Cool quirks and extra skills on the side (like teaching others how to play instruments). Plus bagpipes.*

I hope that gives you an idea of my mindset for this game and how I feel about the classes in this game. In terms of crafting, I have no idea which one I like the most, though I will say I like prospecting/related craft, be it arms, armour, or jewels.

In general, I just feel lost and constrained. Spread thin, asking myself so many questions that I just can't dig deep enough to find the answers for. What do I do? Do I delete a few of my toons? Do I limit myself? Do I roll 1-7 50 times and then chose the number that registers the most as the one I play and nothing else until level x?

I'm a consistent 3-month subscriber. I want to play this game. I feel stuck. I'm an altoholic and I appreciate your help. :(

Feel free to talk about your ""altoholism"" if you feel the same way.

1361406563.0	18x650	Guardian or Captain - what to choose?	easterstream	13	4	14	"As the title concludes, I've come to a bit of dilemma.

I used to play LotRO back in 2007-2008 with a friend, at that time I rolled as a Captain and got to about level 37. IIRC, I thought the class was quite unique due to its versatility and with the use of heralds and such, but as many others I found the soloing to be slow.

Anyway, I've decided to pick up LotRO again and see if I'll find it enjoyable this time as well. So far I've created two characters, one Captain at 16 and one Guardian at 12. 
The reason why I'm considering a Guardian is that I've never really tanked in an MMO before and would really like to give it a serious shot. Tanks are always needed, but I've heard that Captains are high in demand as well so it's hard to decide.

Therefore I've got a couple of questions, if you'd take the time to answer:
• In the aspect of dungeons/instances, which class do you find most enjoyable to play? I know they've got quite different roles, but do you prefer taking all the damage for the fellowship or act as a support?
• Same question in terms of soloing/levelling, which one is funnier? I'm aware that they both tend to level slower than other classes, so that's not an issue.
• What does it look like during level cap and end-game, is there a shortage of Guardians or Captains? How about the entertainment level during raids?

All in all, I know that it comes down to which class I find most enjoyable to play and that's what matters. But I personally prefer to play a class which isn't in abundance, I'd like that my character is almost always welcome in a fellowship for dungeons or whatever.

8 GB DDR3 RAM
GEForce 560 Multiview video card
1GB Barricuda 7200RPM drive
80mbs/30mbs connection 
I run the game at high settings in 1920x1080 resolution and have tried tweaking things around in terms of shadows/draw distances/etc although I never touched the troubleshooting settings. I get mostly similar performance out of the game whether I'm maxing absolutely everything or have everything on medium-high settings. 

Here are my issues:

#1 - My high level toon in particular takes a long time to load into the game. It's not extremely long normally but long enough that I want to go tab out and do something while I'm waiting.
#2 - I occasionally get video stuttering issues, particularly with my draw distance being set high and in high populated areas. Sometimes if I level up and ding a few things at once, the video will just freeze momentarily and then all of a sudden I get an explosion of notifications.
#3 - Rohan stutters on a fairly regular basis while mounted , it seems like I'm always rubber banding although it mostly happens where it just feels a little clunky and doesn't have me flinging all over the place (which also happens)

So I understand my system isn't exactly cutting edge but it's not too shabby either. I feel like I should be able to run this game maxed out. I can max out most other games that I've tried without any noticeable performance issues. Here, there's nothing particularly painful - the game is playable the way it is but at the same time it annoys me when I keep getting these hiccups.

So - with all of that said - I am considering upgrading my system and I'm wondering if anybody here can give me some idea as to what would fix my issues above or if they are all server-related on Turbine's end. After doing a bit of research I've found that upgrading to an SSD would be the best bang for my buck but if it's not going to fix any of my issues, I won't bother.

Any input would be great, thanks!

Back when Codemasters ran the eu version of LOTRO i got stuck on 2 different characters in Moria and left the game but i really want to make it through to see everything that comes after

At the moment my Captain is level 56 and while i still hate being inside a dungeon for so long i have to say the revamp makes it so much more tolerable than before

Now i'm wondering if the revamped quests are better than Lothlorien quests and if i should endure Moria and try to do all quests there or leave that dark horrible place so i can enjoy the open air, hot sun and the smell of grass once again

With the recent surge of activity (What up Kenny, Doom, Dath and all!), I believe it would behoove us to begin an effort to start kicking ass like we used to.  I'm not talking about raiding (yet), but lets swell our numbers, make kin chat absolutely hilarious, and use the new vent server!  Going along with that, the biggest allure to LotRO for me is th community.  You people (what do you mean you people?) are awesome.  It's a bummer to see Reddit all split up over different servers.  There's no resolving that, we dropped the ball with activity, and reddit kins popped up elsewhere.  Nbd.  So, back to my original statement.  Lets do some damn recruiting.  I'll be happy to spearhead this.  Secondly, talking about community, we have a pretty well populated server, we should try to run some community events.

1356498674.0	15gcpm	Finding a cost-effective way to level	internetosaurus	11	3	18	"So I tried this game recently and like it well enough, although the server disagreeing with my character model about when I've stopped moving for spell casting is a bit annoying. I'd like to play through the full leveling experience, and while this Steam sale is going on seems to be a good time to do so.

I'm thinking the cheapest way to do this (other than grinding all the TP through deeds, which seems like it would make the game 0 fun) is to pick up the triple pack and Rohan heroic from Steam, then using the 1000 TP from the Rohan expac to buy a quest pack that goes from 40-50 like Angmar or Misty Mountains.

Having not purchased any quest packs yet, is a single pack enough to get through a 10 level range? If so then I'll probably go for it, $45 to have a full leveling path from 30-85 seems pretty reasonable. Obviously I'll wait until Jan 5th to make the purchase in case it goes on daily/flash sale for less before then.

I've played and enjoyed all of the previous expacs before RoR, and have been a high level raider for years in the game (see: all raids 100%). Honestly after playing other games and less and less lotro, I found getting back into it seemed really difficult. 

I played RoI a bit, having done Draigoth T2, but never the Isenguard raids or instances. The game just seemed REALLY slow on my Runekeeper or Champion.

SO my question. Is RoR more exciting / interesting than RoI? Has the game gotten slightly faster paced or is it still 10+ hits per mob at maximum level? Are people still forced to do that same freaking instances they've been doing for YEARS (ie GB / Annu / etc) for marks for new items?
