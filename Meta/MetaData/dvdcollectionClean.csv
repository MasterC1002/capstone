Secondly, I like ice cream

Thirdly, I LOVE cake

But to get to the matters at hand.  I wanted to make this post so when i make a post about CotM post you'll know what's going on or at least be vaguely aware I made a post about something.

When Collector of the Month was started Charles had about 17 people to choose from which made picking quite easy.  When we grew larger Charles would take nominations and then when I came on board He and I would discuss people and come to an agreement.  We stopped this as we ran out of chickens to fight each other.  Also we got more Moderators so 5 people would come to a great conclusion usually on who to nominate.  This works well mostly because 99% of the time, despite all having separate voices, we agree on most everything.

However, by doing this we've taken it out of your hands to voice opinions.  So, for now on anywhere between 5-7 days before we announce a winner I'm going to make a post to our community for your nominations.  You post your nomination and why.  We'll take those and our own nominations and come to a conclusion.  This may make things tougher but it gives YOU guys more of a voice in the direction your community goes in.

So, look for a post in a week or so asking for nominations.  Have them in mind.  I'm making this post this far in advance to make you more aware of it and maybe you'll pay more attention to those who are going out of their way to help.

Thanks for your time, please, continue your normal DVD viewing.

**[Here are our past winners]( http://redvdit.com/cotm)** Keep this in mind when nominating as we like to pick new people when possible.  Or at least someone that's not won in the past year.  Oh look at that, i'm eligible again *cough cough*. =)"	t5_2sm9e	True

Long time subscriber, but I mostly just lurk here and enjoy collection porn :)

So, I work at Amazon and I recently was handed the responsibility of making purchasing DVDs on Amazon.com suck less.  This can mean anything, from page layout, to recommendations improvements, to improved title descriptions...it could be anything you want.  This is where *you* all come in.  You guys buy DVDs, a lot of them, and I'm sure some of you get some of them from Amazon.  This means you're some of the best customers on the planet and the most qualified to answer the following questions:

* Where do you shop for DVDs most and why?
* Are you Sarah Connor?
* If you do buy on Amazon, what do you like/not like about it?
* What is a fire, and why does it — what's the word — burn?
* What are your biggest annoyances with buying DVD/Blu Ray online?
* What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

(If you answer all the above questions I may give you a small prize.)

tl;dr:  What keeps you from saying shut up and take my money when buying titles for your collection online?

So as many of you know, we went from ""a little ways before we hit 1000"" to ""wow! 1079!"" rather quickly. [here are the stats showing as such](http://i.imgur.com/uNMrM.png).  The impressions and uniques are staying the same which means that though people have subscribed they're not really bringing in much in way of views. 

However, i've seen about 5 or 6 people post they were new in a matter of a day so to get that many active and vocal members in that short time makes us all happy i'm sure.

What this means, if you see a post to the subreddit, vote it up.  The more upvotes and comments on posts the more likely some are to see it on their front page.  We have 1,079 members, we should be seeing 100+ upvotes.  If it pertains to this subreddit, UPVOTE!  Many times i don't see our most popular posts until about page 4 and 5 of my ""front page"".  We need to make sure we vote up more as well as make comments.

I'm super excited in the direction the Subreddit has taken and movie night showed that we still got people interested in watching movies as we had just under a dozen people show up to watch.  Doesn't sound like a lot but since we get a dozen every single week (Except for Memento, sorry Charles and The Simpsons where we had our record number of viewers... i love bringing that up) this is a strong showing after 5 or 6 movie nights.

To our current members, you guys are rocking our subreddit.  I've seen more then one person recently say how warm of a welcome they have received here and that's all because of you awesome guys.  Keep up the tremendous work.

To the new members and the lurkers, please, make comments, post your collections.  Come to our movie nights and more importantly, join us in chat.  You don't have to cam up, just type.  I've made many friends through that chat and you will too.  You will meet great people like giga, duals, floppay, orock, marcoosha, hotasmonkeys, and when the mood strikes her My_Password_Is_Penis as well as Charles and alliterativegenius and royal_b that's just to name some.

If you have ideas, please send us moderator mail or even make a post.  Ideas are strongly encouraged for contests and such and as we have over 1000 members now i'd like to see more contests.

If you have any comments, tell us, we want to hear it.  If you have any worries, tell us, we want to hear it.  Any great ideas, tell us, we want to hear it."	t5_2sm9e	True

There are many implications in which I strongly disagree with with regard to our ""glorious"" moderator charlesp22.  For example, the chat room is enforcing a ""PG-13"" environment, however when something is stated in a PG-13 context, one is immediately kicked or given a stern talking to.

I have personally brought this to the attention of charles citing the definition of PG13 and was immediately replied with ""this is my subreddit, it is my rules"".  Well sir, I have some news for you, you're pathetic.  No wonder it took you as long as it did to get a job, you have the fact that you run this subreddit on your resume.  Running a subreddit is **NOT** an employable quality.

I am not the only one who feels this way about your ""rules"" as it has been brought up to me by **SEVERAL** of your users.  I'm not going to provide any names, however I have advised them to bring it to your attention.  While it is a matter of whether or not they decide to do so, they are likely not going to do so because of how intimidating you are.

As of now, all contests hosted by myself are cancelled.  The ""Biggest Loser R/DVDCollection Style"" contest is closed completely, I have marked the subreddit as private so your posts cannot be seen by other than yourself.

The movie scene swede contest for a copy of DuckTales is now closed as well.  All of my entries in any of the other contests hosted by other members, consider them null and void as I do **NOT** want to be a part of a community that's run by a hypocritical maniac.

I should also note that this message is directed only at charlesp22 and not the other mods, Duals902 and Stalked_Like_Corn, you guys were only doing what was asked of you so I am hot holding you accountable for any of this.  

One final note, normally I wouldn't consider doing something as public as this, however after bringing it to charles' attention in private and hearing other people complain about this, it's time for a public bashing."	t5_2sm9e	True

So this is a contest that i'm holding for the 1 year anniversary of our beloved subreddit, /r/DVDCollection.  **The contest starts at July 4th, 1pm EDT and will end August 5th 1pm EDT.**  I've been here for a while now.  I've gone from being a lurker to a regular, a regular to an expert, an expert to collector of the month, and now I'm a moderator.  I feel very fortunate to have found such a great subreddit and I strive to make it better.  Hence, I've created this contest.

I'll say upfront that the prize is maybe not as grand as I had hoped,  but it's an **Amazon Gift Card for $100**!  The steps to win the contest are fairly arduous and complicated.  It will require a bit work and dedication but that shouldn't be a problem because those are the cornerstones this subreddit was built on.  Not only will completing the steps help make /r/DVDCollection better, you'll be working towards a prize.

How you ask?  Easily, by submitting content.  Yep, just by submitting content.  We have 3 main posts in this subreddit and 1 we're trying to make a regular; Pickups, Recommendations, Discussions, and Inside the Boxes.  Inside the box videos can be found by both Gigafrost and Duals902.  You basically take a box set with extras, open it up, and tell us about the contents.

Pictures are **required** for both Pickups and Inside the Boxes as a *minimum*.  Posting a video will get you a bonus point, with a maximum of 2 bonus points for the entirety of the contest.  If you are using pictures to do a Pickup post, displaying your reddit username is **required**.  If you're doing a video pickup, simply stating your Reddit username will do, but it's also **required**.  Now for some more rules.

* **Pickups**  No more than 2 in the month are allowed.  You may post more but only two will be counted as entries for the contest.  A minimum of 2 movies will have to be in each pickups post.  (2 points)
* **Recommendations** No more than 2 a week and no more than 8 total.  You can do more than 8 but only 8 will be counted as entries. (8 points) Recommendation posts need to be of substantial quality.  Iâ€™m not asking for 17 paragraphs but if you only post a 1 paragraph RECO you will be informed that it needs to have more content.
* **Discussions** No more than 3 per week and no more than 6 allowed total.  You can do more but they will not count for points. (6 points)
* **Inside the Boxes** No more than 1 per week and no more than 2 allowed total.  You can do more but they will not count for points. (2 points)

If you count that up, it's a total of 18 points.  If you do 2 videos you will get 2 bonus points that will raise your total to 20 points.  Each point is one entry in the contest.  The names of the contestants that have earned points will be assigned numbers.  That list of numbers will be entered into my phone and I will use a program to randomly choose the winner.  The winner will be chosen during a live stream in [our chat room](http://www.icanhazchat.com/dvdcollection) at the completion of the contest.  I will announce everyones number and when the live drawing will take place in a separate post.

When you make a post that you want counted as an entry for the contest, you are **required** to PM the username [r_DVDCollection](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r_DVDCollection) for it to count.  The subject should be RECO, Pickup, Inside the Box, or Discussion and a link to your post will need to be in the body of the PM.  Please leave a post here, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdvdcollection&amp;subject=One%20Year%20Anniversary%20Contest%20question), or [message Stalked_Like_Corn](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Stalked_Like_Corn&amp;subject=One%20Year%20Anniversary%20Contest%20question) if you have any questions.

###Moderators can make changes to these rules WITHOUT prior notice to ensure fairness to everyone involved.  If any changes are made they will be posted to the subreddit as well as changed in this post itself.  Bookmarking this post will insure you see if we had to close a loophole that was being exploited.  If anyone is found to be ""gaming the system"" they will be immediately disqualified and may face other punishments up to a warning or even an /r/DVDCollection banning.###

I am very excited about this and something I've been thinking about for a little bit now. We have collectors from all over the world, and we all have different schedules. Trying to come to 2 movie parties a month at a specific time and date just can't be done by everyone.


However what can be done by all of us is watching **one** movie whenever we want every 2 or 3 weeks. 

**So what is /r/dvdcollection movie club**?

*It's like a book club... for movies*

* Once every Two-Three Weeks anyone that's part of the subreddit will be welcome to enjoy and watch a movie that is nominated and voted on by our members. Voting and noms will work much like our movie party noms. Any one can vote, but to nominate a movie you must have participated in the previous movie's discussion thread. 

Thats right discussion thread. After 2-3 weeks (each date will be announced when the movie is selected) a discussion thread will be posted by yours truly.  These threads can discuss anything related to the movies, these threads **will not be spoiler** free, as any aspect of the movie can be discussed.  I ask that all opinions of club members be respected, I reserve the right to remove deuch baggery and troll comments that attacks someones opinion. 


I will also be giving out prizes for those that watch the movie and participate in the discussion thread. Thats right double incentive. If you participate in the tread (that is substantial content, not just ""Yeah I agree"", ""Thats cool"" ""This sucks"" ""I like turtles""), you will be eligible for a prize and you can nominate the next movie we watch for the club. 


Some times nominations I ask for will be themed (say horror movies around halloween etc) but other than that the nominations are wide open. I just generally ask that nominations be movies you feel can generate some solid discussion on our subreddit. **Edit**: *Movies need to be available on DVD or Blu-Ray, no future releases.*  

Discussion can be your reviews and opinions, critical analysis of the conversion rate of the blu-ray, discussion of movie themes, actors, directors, etc. 


Personally I've been wanting to do this because Sunday nights aren't necessarily the best night for movies for me, but I wnat to be able to watch and talk about movies with my fellow collectors.


So lets get this started!

I'm going to go ahead and select the first movie for us to watch. Its one that is readily available and a very important film in American film history and just a down right damn good film

**Tl;dr**- Movie club... watch a specific movie every couple weeks, talk about the movie, rinse repeat.
__________

**The first movie we will be watching is** *To Kill a Mockingbird*. This film is one of my all time favorite films, and is rare film that is equally as amazing as the book its based off of.

Because this is the first film I'll give just over 3 weekends for everyone to watch this film. Please have the film watched by Sunday **May 12th.** (This also allows for people to order the film in time) Either that Sunday or Monday I will post a discussion thread, where I will also ask for nominations. Then I will do a voting thread, and finally announce a new movie after that thread closes.  Then I will announce another date to have the movie watched by. 

I encourage any of our collectors to watch this together in /r/dvdcollection  chat as well at anytime they can, but the whole purpose is to watch this at any time you have available so you can discuss the film with collectors. "	t5_2sm9e	True

##What should you be doing right now?
Now then, for those of you that are signed up, please create an Amazon wish list with at least 10 DVDs and/or BluRays that you are hoping to get. Try and make sure that you have a range of prices, so some things that are under 10, some over 10, and some crazy priced stuff... The more things you have on your list, the better. Just make sure you actually want the things that you put on your list. You will be getting your matches on Monday, and will be exchanging your lists. You will not be giving to the same person you are receiving from, so this is not a ""give to get"" gift  exchange. 

***

You are only required to get the person one thing on their list, it can be new or used in good condition. They must be retail copies, and not burned copies of anything. You can add things in your packages like movie snacks, gifts from your local area, movie-related gifts, or random crap that you find laying around your house. (This happens more often than I would like to admit)

***

First of all, EVERYONE upvote this post. It needs to be at the top of the page all day.
***

##Step one
Post your wishlist and collection list [here](http://redd.it/rfekr)

##Step two
Message the person you are gifting TO and ask for their wishlist and collection if it hasn't been posted. Also ask for their preferred shipping address. If you are in different countries, make sure you know which region code you are buying.

##Step three
Begin shopping for your giftee! Another fun thing to do is stalk your Giftee on Reddit. Find out if they have posted anything that might be relevant that you could include in your gift to them!

##Step four
Ship! You can ship any time from now up until May 1st.

***

### If you haven't connected with your people on both sides (Gifter and Giftee) by Monday, 2 April let me know.

1338255668.0	u9lyz	So, I just lost my DVD collection	WandererGreshil	33	0	21	"Long story short, my house was robbed over the weekend. They took games consoles, handhelds, head phones etc but the most crushing is the fact that they took my entire DVD collection.
 
 It was a collection dedicated to Wrestling DVD's, I had almost all of the WWF/WWE pay per view events from 1985 to 2011. Some of the events I have are impossible to get on DVD individually as they are too old an so the only way they can be obtained is through box sets which were produced in limited runs. I guess my main error is that I kept them all in a CD wallet, this was purely a transport and storage solution as I'm at Uni at the minute. Becaue of that the theif was able to grab literally everything in seconds, same with my 360/ps3 games which are also stored in a wallet.

 Back at my parents house I have the boxes for all of them an I'm not too sure what I'm gonna do with they as it looks highly unlikely that I'll get any of the discs back.

 I've been looking around this subreddit for a while and see how proud everyone is of their collections, infact I kept meaning to post pics of mine but obviously it's too late now. I'm sorry if this is a bit of a downer post but I just had to tell someone and this seemed like the most appropriate place.

1334173495.0	s4upw	(Recommendation) - Clone High.	JoeRCK	32	1	13	"Way back in 2003, MTV ran a cartoon show that only lasted one season. Not really a surprise there. The show they ran was called Clone High. It's a cartoon show created by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, How I Met Your Mother, and 21 Jump Street fame) And also Bill Lawrence (of Spin City, Scrubs, and Cougar Town fame.) and it only ran for 13 episodes. It parodies high school drama shows and it features some of histories notable figures. The last 5 episodes didn't air in the United States but it ran on syndication in Canada and through that, It developed a cult following. 

If you are a fan of animation and wanted to see how Phil Lord and Chris Miller got their start, then you should check this show out. It features some great celebrity cameos from Marylin Manson, Tom Green, and Jack Black. The writing is smart and the episode ""Raisin The Stakes: A Rock Opera in Three Acts"" is a very well constructed musical episode. You can breeze through it in an afternoon and the cliffhanger ending might leave you in tears.

Here is the link in [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clone-High-Complete-1st-Season/dp/B000AABKGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334173046&amp;sr=8-1) but it's only available in Canada, so it may be a little pricey but it's worth it."	t5_2sm9e	True

1332790947.0	ren83	It's my cakeday but I have no cat to karma-whore with, so this will have to make do: my (meager and unimpressive) DVD collection.	RhymesWithEloquent	34	5	26	"http://imgur.com/a/4lxPX#0

- I hail from NYC originally, but I'm attending school in MD.

- Favorite genre? Tough one--I like all kinds, but my favorites would probably be period drama, horror, and black comedy if you'll allow me to use it as a film genre. You'll definitely see from my collection that I have varied tastes, although to be fair most of them are random pickups from the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.

- The first DVD I ever bought was *Forbidden Planet*, although that was a gift for my brother. The first one I bought for myself? I can't remember at this point, but I think it might have been *The Shining.*

- I don't have any guilty pleasures. I like what I like and dislike what I dislike, and I don't have to justify it any more than that.

- My least favorite movie I own? Probably *Lucky Number Slevin,* which I bought because it came in a two-pack with *The Matador.* But I just can't get into *Lucky Number Slevin.*

- My favorite director is Ingmar Bergman, although I think Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick both take close second. Unfortunately, Criterion prices being what they are, there's a disturbing lack of Kurosawa in my collection--I make do by borrowing/renting his work whenever I get the urge.

- What I'm most proud of? I don't know. I guess I'm most proud of my four Bergman films--they're certainly the highlights of my collection.

- What I'm looking for? More money. T_T

- I don't use software to keep track of my collection. Any suggestions on free software?

(EDIT: The whole karma-whore thing was a joke. I don't get karma from self posts. :D)

As some of you may know I've had some stuff going on in the real world that has demanded 100% of my attention and time and I've not been able to dedicate the time I needed to for the contest.

I have not forgotten it, i just want you to know this, but I may need to delay it just for a bit.  I'd not do this unless I absolutely had to.  It's my hope that we will be selecting a winner at the **[Movie Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/dvdcollection/comments/y8tqa/movie_party_join_us_at_6pm_pst_on_august_26th_for/)** on August 26th, 2012.

For those wondering, my Mothers health has taken a extreme nose dive the past 2 months and it's all I can do to keep up with it.  It's actually become more than I can do but that's a long sob story not needed here.  

So, again, sorry for the lack of communication and I will make a better effort in the future to keep everyone up to date.  Just know that I've not forgotten it and a prize will be awarded to one lucky individual. =)

If any questions you can PM me, or any of our friendly moderators who all have a direct line to me even offline."	t5_2sm9e	True

I wanted to let everyone know that I have taken over maintaining the Map of Collectors. If you would like to be added please let me know, you can find links in the sidebar.

You can also find the map at **http://redvdit.com/map** we currently have over 160 collectors listed!!

Take a second to check it out, make sure you're on there and your little icon is whatever gender you prefer. If it's not, just let me know.

When requesting to be added, feel free to be as specific as you'd like. We're still waiting for quite a few countries (and entire continents!) to come forward.

I would also like to give a **BIG THANKS** to [TheFatKid4Life](http://www.reddit.com/user/TheFatKid4Life) for creating most of the custom icons for the mods, experts and other essential members of our community."	t5_2sm9e	True

Submit your nominations and vote here!	therealjshaff	30	4	40	"I don't know about you guys, but I've really *really* enjoyed seeing everyone's top five films this week. If you haven't joined in the fun yet, you've still got a few days, so keep those posts (tagged with **[Collection Spotlight]**, as always!) coming!

In the meantime, it's time for your nominations! Let me know what you'd like to see as our next Spotlight in the comments below, and the comment with the most upvotes by the end of the day on Monday will be next week's Collection Spotlight!

**NOTE:** I've had a few comments in the past couple announcement threads from people who are somehow missing these threads when I post them on Saturdays. So please help those kind souls out by throwing this post an upvote for visibility! I get no karma from this self-post, I promise! Thanks, guys."	t5_2sm9e	True

Why don't we set a topic each week for collectors to spotlight certain parts of their collections? I call the idea... Collection Spotlight! (*Genius*, I know.)

For instance, the unofficial topic for this week would have been Comic Book Movies. At the end of the week, I would make a thread asking for nominations for next week's Spotlight topic, and the idea with the most upvotes would be the topic for the next week. And so on and so forth.

Like the idea? Post your nomination! Have a huge number of films from a certain director, time period, genre, country? Nominate it, and the comment with the most upvotes by the end of the day on Monday (let's say 11:59 PM ET for officialness's sake) will become the Spotlight topic for next week (Tuesday through Saturday).

EDIT: Just for clarity's sake, please just nominate **one** topic to be voted on in each comment. If you have more than one suggestion, that's great! But please save some of your nominations for future votes! Otherwise there will be mass confusion during the voting process, and confusion makes my brain sizzle."	t5_2sm9e	True

1. What city/state/country do you live in?  Waterloo, Ontario Canada 
2. What is your favourite genre?  Is ""excellence"" considered a genre?
3. First DVD I ever bought: I remember it clearly.  My first DVD was SNATCH waaaaay back in 2001 (or was it 2000?).  My first Blu-Ray purchase was CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
4. My guilty pleasure movie is:   I don't typically associate guilt with pleasure.
5. My least favourite movie I own is: X-MEN: THE LAST STAND, but in my defense it was a gift from my grandparents, and it's a hardcore special edition...I just can't help myself.  Oh god, what's wrong with me...?
6. My favourite director:  Hands down the greatest living director working today has to be Martin Scorsese, but I'm also a whore for the works of Tarantino, Kevin Smith, David Fincher, David Cronenberg, Terry Gilliam and Christopher Nolan.  Nobody particularly esoteric, but I mean, these dudes are famous for a reason. 
7. What I'm most proud of:  The BLADE RUNNER briefcase edition is one of the crown jewels of my collection.  Also have to mention THE EVIL DEAD Book of the Dead edition because it was hands down the single best Valentine's Day gift I ever received.
8. What I'm looking for:  I have a list the size of my... well, let's just say it's long.  Currently trying to round out my selection of Scorsese and Cronenberg, any hardcore special edition, and anything a little off the beaten path that makes me feel a little superior when I tell my friends about it and they've never heard about it before.  Oh yeah, that's the stuff...
9. How do you organize and sort your collection:  Alphabetically, then separated into movies, TV shows, and Blu-Ray.  I think I'm getting to the point where the collection is big enough where I'm going to start organizing by director and genre, though.
10. Software/app I use to keep track:  Good old fashioned Excel spreadsheet, just like the pilgrims.  Official count about 532, but who's counting? 

Alright, here are some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/WOKJ1#0), hope this works.  This is my first ever post, so bear with me. "	t5_2sm9e	True

1336704539.0	thkwg	Recommendation - The IT Crowd.	JoeRCK	27	2	15	"The IT Crowd is a British live audience sitcom. It's written by Graham Linehan of Father Ted fame and Black Books. It's set in an office setting with the main characters of Moss (Richard Ayoade), Roy (Chris O'Dowd), and Jen (Katherine Parkinson) working in the basement as an Information Technology help squad. 

Most of Reddit raves about this show and I wanted to check it out. I got in to this show through Netflix instant streaming and I was generally impressed how funny it is. There's some great dialogue, funny running gags, and hilarious pop culture references. The humor is a bit juvenile but you can believe it coming from these characters. I think it's kind of like The Big Bang Theory, except the scenarios are better written. At least personally to me it is. I did laugh through a lot of this show and there's only 6 episodes per season so you breeze through it in a weekend. The show has ended but the creator is thinking about a special in 2012.

1376662248.0	1khlbe	[Discussion] Big news from Criterion this week: Starting in November, they will be releasing films in BD/DVD combo packs and eliminating the separate formats. Thoughts?	therealjshaff	27	4	26	"As someone who only buys Criterion Blu-rays, I personally have no problem with this move, with two conditions:

1. The price of the Blu-rays do not increase (I mean, seriously, they're already expensive as it is).
2. The packaging remains consistent with the current Blu-ray packaging.

However, for those collectors who buy Criterion DVDs, this is bad news, because they will now be paying Blu-ray prices for the DVD releases of the films.

I also think that this is a sure indicator that DVD is on the way out. If Criterion were making their money off of the DVD releases of their films, then they would have no reason to eliminate DVD-only releases. I could see them eventually eliminating DVDs all together if this experiment works out for them.

What do you guys think? Love, like, hate the change? Indifferent? What does this mean for the DVD vs. BD debate that we have so often in this sub?"	t5_2sm9e	True

Best buy is having another event starting next weekend where you can trade in ANY dvd to get a $5 off coupon on any $10 bluray and up. This can even be penny dvd's from a dollar store and such, they don't care what it is. Might help you all with upgrading your collections.

I copied the following info from a thread at cheap ass gamer (credit goes to them on this text). I hope this helps you all!

-- Limit 5 per visit. Per visit is most often interpreted as 5 per day per customer, but many people have just walked out and come back in immediately or later the same day with 5 more discs. Plenty of people have done far
more than 5 at a single visit as long as the store allows the exception.

-- No stacking of U&amp;S coupons. One U&amp;S Coupon, One Bluray . A Single $5 U&amp;S coupon is allowed per Bluray or Bluray boxset (it may be the only rule I've never seen stretched). A boxset of 3 movies will not allow 3 coupons
and you can't use 2 or 3 coupons on a single Bluray under any circumstance.

-- Most of the time the coupons have an expiration date co-coinciding with the last day of the program so you can't save them and use them next month.

2) Trade in DVDs do not have to be same title as Bluray. Boxsets are most often counted as 1 DVD so if you bring is a set with 4 movies in one case then you will likely be given 1 coupon and not a coupon for each disc.
If your set has for cases in a boxset, just toss the box. If you have a TV series with 5 cases, bring them in as individual pack and not as a set. This works best if each case has a UPC code (S1, Disc 1). I've also found
that if you bring in a bunch of discs of the same season, same show then some clerks will balk so best idea is to bring 1 (slim)case from each set and make another trip later or be prepared to discuss the details.

-- If somebody pulls up a list off Google of 100 or 150 Old Blurays that are ""Only Movies Allowed"" then they are likely showing you the lists for May or October 2011 which were restricted to certain titles. The Google lists
get pulled up everytime this program is live either online or even instore -- check the dates on the list. If someone tries to tell you only same titles can be exchanged then they are incorrect. This is not the same of Selling/Trade-In
for Used Video Games and every time there are lots of people who get sent to the Video Games Department by employees thinking you are selling items. The Upgrade and Save program is separate and almost
always handled at the Customer Service Counter.

3) DVD must be a commercially produced discs (no burned copies)

4) No adult DVD that are specifically XXX content whether they are rated XXX or not.

5) Discs are supposed to have the original case and artwork and the discs are meant to be at least presentable -- the disc at least should look like it can be played. Many stores require the UPC to be intact. Some stores
check things pretty closely (right disc, right case, right UPC, disc condition) and others just toss the case into the recycle bin without any screening. In reality discs in anything that look like regular case are often accepted
by some stores including those is Blockbuster/3rd party cases with rental stickers and and nowhere near original artwork and UPC.

** Are HDDVD or HD-DVD combo packs eligible. This has been a YMMV issue and some places people have been given credit for both type discs, others only if it was a combo, and some stores refused to consider it
at all for the trade-in. If you run into this issue either try a different store or call 1-800 BESTBUY and see if they can clarify the issue for you or your Store Manager.

6) Bluray -- all current and new release Bluray priced $9.99 or above should be included. Music Blurays have been included since the April 2012 program which is different than previous sales. Preorders are not included.
Discs not in store can sometimes be ordered from BBY.com and some managers will apply a coupon to that item, but ....


7) Each store in the past had there own logistics of how to work the program. Most stores would make you stop at the entry and have your used discs stamped/marked/taped.

-- Many stores had you bring the used DVD to the Service desk, check them out to make sure they met criteria and gave the customer a preprinted coupon(s) with a receipt attached to the coupon/barcode. Some stores
gave the customer a Copied sheet of paper with the UPC bar code and attached receipt to 'activate' the sheet of paper. The coupon could them be exchanged at the regular register for the Bluray you were purchasing and
the barcode automatically deducted the $5 at sale. This allowed you to take your coupons out of the store and purchase later. The expiration date on the official coupon is usually the last day of the sale. . If you are given
a coupon with a receipt attached do not detach them or your coupon may well be disallowed.

-- Some stores required you to bring/leave your DVD at the Customer Service desk, then bring your Blurays to the Service desk to complete the purchase. No coupons were given out so you had to exchange and purchase
the discs the same day.

-- Some stores would allow you to trade your DVD for a coupon at the Service Desk, but each coupon was marked/Dated and you were told it was only valid for the date on the coupon and in that specific store. [Only had
this happen once and I have no idea what would have happened if I took the coupon to a different store or brought it back to the same store later.]

8) Discounts should be taken from the actual Selling Price of the Bluray on the day of purchase despite the fine print on the coupon saying ""Discount taken from Regular Price."" This has and will likely continue to be a
contentious point until corporate absolutely clarifies the issue or changes the language. BBY ads often show discs with Sale Prices and then subtract the $5 U&amp;S coupon so logically that should apply to all other discs.


9) Price matching and also using $5 coupon is a big YMMV since this can be most certainly considered combining offers or double dipping much in the same way that PM and getting a gift card for purchase is often considered
doubling up. Since the U&amp;S is considered a Store coupon it should be applied to the price before trying to PM unlike a Manufacturers coupon (this difference is spelled out very specifically in Target and other stores coupon
use policy, but not specifically in BBY policy).

10) There should be absolutely no arguments about using Reward Zone certificates during purchase.

11) Additional Manufacturers Coupons SHOULD BE allowed and should be considered the same as cash or a gift card on top of the $5 Promo. This doesn't mean it won't be argued and it certainly doesn't mean it will
be accepted, but according the Best Buy's own Corporate Reps, the use of MQ should never be questioned whether it's a sales price or pricematch or promo.

Multiple times the Best Buy Corporate Employees have had to repeat the phrase ""The store should honor the coupon, even with the price match. Any valid manufacturer’s coupon displaying the manufacturer’s address,
a barcode, and labeled as a Manufacturer’s coupon at the top should be accepted on the product listed, regardless of the price."" If there are any issues call the 1-800 number in store and ask for a ruling (unfortunately
this often ends up being decided ""Manager runs his own store in his own way"" unless it just flat out violates some policy. BBY.com community forums are the best place to take issues and often will be decided in
the customers favor with credits and RZ given to cover the missed discounts. Yelling and screaming in the store is not going to win you any arguments in store even if you are correct and will likely get security involved
and irritate everybody else in the store.

12) Buying a disc this week in hopes of applying the coupon next week will work, but it should work as a return/Rebuy so if the price is higher next week it may not always save you money. As usual there is some YMMV
whether some stores will allow you to repurchase the same disc unless the store has current stock. The same can be said of ordering discs online for pick up at the store -- some stores have allowed a return/rebuy to
add the coupon and some stores have refused to do this.

13) Only USED DVD or HDDVD movies are normally allowed as trade in. . Best Buy is only supposed to accept used DVDs, so make sure the DVD(s) you're bringing in to trade are unwrapped. They will sometimes
refuse to accept them if they're sealed. If you find some sealed DVD cheap and bring them to the store sealed, there have been issues. The easiest thing to do is just open them

14) Where to find cheap DVDs: If you don't have any spare DVDs laying around that you wish to part with, there are a variety of places to find cheap DVDs for less than $1-$2 each. Pawn shops, thrift stores, garage sales,
flea markets, dollar stores, and Ebay Several people have had success at Dollar Tree, where select DVDs can be found for 25 cents, and some titles even for 1 cent. *Disclaimer* Finding these 25/1 cent DVDs
is a YMMV situation. Some stores have them, some don't. Some BBY stores have balked at accepting these essentially throwaways in slim cases or cardboard sleeves though technically they are commercially manufactured and in their original cases so you should prevail.

Bringing 5 of the exact same item in for trade in -- often these cheapo discs can raise some eyebrows so if you can divide them up and bring in 5 different items it will go smoother though not to say it won't work

15) Most people have failed at trading in Blurays for coupons even if there is a DVD in the case.

16) If you have a multidisc DVD with those removable trays for extra disc, it is best if you just bring in the case with the tray out and you can keep the extra disc (cool for bonus material). Empty disc trays do raise suspicion
at the service desk.

17) Nobody knows exactly what happens to the old discs and cases. The official word is they are recycled at some national recycling center -- whether this means they are donated to charities for a tax deduction. 

CAG has also posted the following deals, a bunch of bluray's that will be $5 after the coupon. Hope this helps too!

I'm sick of stealing, I've always loved the movie industry and I would like to support them when they come out with movies that I like. Also a personal opinion of mine is that having the physical copy of the DVD is way cooler than having a computer file. I can show off my collection and I can watch movies on my TV way easier than going through the effort of setting up my laptop. (Or I can use my laptop while I watch a DVD, also a plus)

My collection isn't anywhere close to what some of you guys have but bear with me, I just started less than a month ago and if I bought every DVD I wanted every time I was at Wal Mart I wouldn't have any money.

Here it is - [My Collection](http://i.imgur.com/APN4o.jpg)

Yes I have 2 of each LotR. When I was 10 my logic was ""Why get widescreen when I can have FULL screen"" I punch myself now for that but luckily I found the extended editions on amazon for $5 a piece.

I try and buy a new DVD every time I go shopping so that I don't have to buy 10 at one time. That way I don't spend money so fast and I also have time to watch the DVDs when I buy them.

Interview thingy

1. Which state do you live? Iowa
What is your favorite genre? I have ADD so it changes a lot but if I had to pick one I would have to say Thrillers, especially ones with a twist ending. Fight Club being being one of my all time favorite movies (I liked it to much I actually read the book, and I never read haha)

2. First DVD I ever bought: Dude Where's my Car - I'm very proud of this. From people I've talked to it doesn't seem that popular but it is one of my all time favorite movies as well.

3. My guilty pleasure movie is: I don't really have one, most of the movies I like that I've searched mainly got good reviews. When I was younger me and a friend saw Napolean Dynamite, Hot Rod, and Grandma's Boy in theaters and couldn't stop laughing but all my friends hated them. Now those movies are pretty popular though. 

The opposite of this, a movie I hate that everyone loves is The Avengers. I know, I know you hate me right now for saying that but I'm just being honest. To be fair though I don't really know Marvel that well so I really didn't know what was going on.

4. My least favorite movie I own is: DareDevil - I loved it in theaters when I was around 13 but not so much anymore. Still an alright movie though.

5. My favorite director: Tough one. A tie between Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. Honorable mentions would be Darren Aronofsky, Guy Ritchie, and Danny Boyle.

6. What I'm most proud of: Quitting pirating and starting to buy DVDs haha. If this means DVD I'm most proud of then probably Snatch. Such a great movie that mixes comedy, action, fighting, Brad Pitt, awesome soundtrack, and so much more. I only wish I would have heard about this movie sooner.

7. What I'm looking for: A lot yet. My pirated collection is close to 200 and I hope to get most of these movies on DVD minus a couple of them. Lately I've been looking for Salton Sea after my cousin recommended it to me. I've looked around a few Wal Marts and a few Best Buy's but I cant find it anywhere. 

8. Software/app I use to keep track: My bookshelf? I just buy DVDs and alphabetize them, my computer doesn't really come into play.

I'm new here so not really sure how this works, let me know if I did anything wrong or need to change something. Otherwise discuss I guess.

***I also have three more movies at a friends house right now - Dude Where's My Car, Donnie Darko, and one more that I cant think of right now."	t5_2sm9e	True

**Plot Summary**:  
After being left in a cabin by their owner, an intrepid group of household appliances, headed by a courageous toaster, makes it their mission to track down the man who abandoned them in this animated adventure in the vein of The Incredible Journey. Conceived by sci-fi scribe Thomas M. Disch, this unique and entertaining film has the stalwart appliances trying to survive in various unfamiliar locations. Will they make it, and will their owner welcome them back?

**Personal Review**:  
This film was made in 1987 by the independent studio Hyperion, and Disney ended up buying the TV and home video rights. somewhere around 1992-93 my younger sister obtained a copy of it on VHS and she watched it over and over again until the tape was ruined. At the time, I thought it was *ok*. Looking back I realize it really is a hidden gem of a movie.

Based on a book by Thomas M. Disch, The Brave Little Toaster tells of appliances that have been abandoned and seek to find their own master. It's got a dash of Toy Story and a hint of Beauty and the Beast and was released before either. The traditional 2D animation isn't exceptionally grand but the voice acting and story move the picture along with ease. Speaking of voice acting keep an ear out for Jon Lovitz, Mindy Sterling, Timothy Stack, [Thurl Ravenscroft](http://youtu.be/cEjZyzA-DJw) and Phil Hartman. Behind the scenes you'll get a wonderful screenplay co-written by the late, great Pixar powerhouse Joe Ranft.

The film was shown at the '88 Sundance Film Festival and earned a Grand Jury Prize nomination. According to Director Jerry Rees, before the awards ceremony, was told by several judges that they considered it to be the best film there but that they couldn't give the award to a cartoon as they considered people wouldn't take the festival seriously afterwards. The film never got released in theaters and premiered on the newly founded Disney Channel earning an Emmy nomination for Best animated Program.

The Washington Post called it **""a kid's film made without condescension""** and I couldn't agree more. This film doesn't go for laughs so much as present a journey for the characters to learn and grow.

Movie - 8/10, DVD - 6/10

**[DVD](http://www.deepdiscount.com/dvd/The-Brave-Little-Toaster)** (use the code **25MORE** at checkout and you'll only pay $6.34 for this brand new) - Ok... the DVD is bare bones. It's unfortunate due to how amazing the film is and the wonderful people that made it. But for the price tag I'd say it's worth it.

**Information for Parents**:  
DVDJunky's minimum age for viewing: **4** - Appliances have (mostly) likeable personalities and they deal with abandonment. This is a journey film more than a comedy and may cause very young children to feel distressed as some of the characters are met with being dropped into waterfalls, quicksand, creepy junk yard mechanical disarticulation and giant evil supermagnets.

Great for talking to your kids about working together as a team and getting along with others even when you may not see eye to eye. I also enjoyed the subtle nod to using older found items instead of buying new.

* **Violence** - This is really the only real issue with really young children watching this film (other than a child becoming frightened of your air conditioner). The things the appliances go through could be seen as somewhat frightening but in my opinion are mild."	t5_2sm9e	True

The show follows two regular guys, Mark and Jeremy (Jez), living together in a London flat. It's a sitcom so the comedy comes from the everyday lives of these socially inept characters. What's really cool about this show and what contributes a lot to the comedic value is that everything takes place from the perspective of one of the characters, often with their internal monologue narrating the events.

Ricky Gervais himself has said, ""the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted"" and also calling it ""the best show on television today."" If you're a fan of British comedy at all give this show a look and even if you aren't, you should still check it out. It is, without question, the greatest sitcom I have ever watched and one of the greatest pieces of television. 

The show is currently on an extended hiatus after the 7th series but it has been picked up for an 8th and 9th which are due to start back up in mid-2012. This is the perfect time to catch up on the show and be ready for its return this year.

&gt;I want to do foreign films, so I would say any film made outside of the United States, with a concentration on mainstream foreign cinema. This would include France, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, China, SKorea, and Spanish cinema. For those outside the United States who wanted to know more about U.S. ""foreign"" films, I could do that as well. The time period concerning this film would range from the early 1900s to the present.

**Briefly explain the history of your AOE?**

&gt;I don't know if this pertains to the actual history of foreign cinema in general, or my history with foreign cinema. ""Actual history"" would include early silent films (Un Chien Andalou, Battleship Potempkin) all the way to the late 1940s of the Italian Neorealism, then the French New Wave 10 years later, the Cahiers du Cinema critics group headed by Andre Bazin, Truffaut, Godard (started in 1951), the Left Bank filmmakers in the late 1950s, Japanese realism in the 70s, etc.

&gt;If the question refers to my history with foreign cinema, I would say I've been into it for about a decade now - ever since I first learned about Battle Royale in 2003 (I believe it'd been out for about three or four years by that point). Since that time, I've taken college classes with focuses on East Asian cinema, Italian Cinema, French cinema, early cinema, and contemporary cinema. Although we watch a lot of films pertaining to these subjects, the majority of foreign cinema that I've seen owe a great deal to the textbooks I would read from.

**How do you find information about titles in your AOE?**

&gt;As mentioned above, I would learn about titles from my readings or even from class discussions at my university. From there I would look up the titles then buy. If the specific title was available on netflix, then I would just watch it on there. Other times, I would learn about good foreign films from discussion with study abroad students or other cinema lovers. More recently I've been pumping through the criterion collection, which is about 95% foreign cinema.

**What is an easily-accessible title that would be a great introduction to your AOE and why?**

&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, hands down. It basically takes internationalization of hollywood cinema to the next level. Filmed by a Taiwanese director (Ang Lee), with Chinese actors, spoken in Mandarin, and heavily produced by Columbia pictures - this film marked the first time that a piece of foreign cinema (without dubbing) found such a large magnitude of success in the United States. It's pretty standard Hollywood fare, but better.

**What is an easily-accessible title that you think epitomizes your AOE and why?**

&gt;I'll probably have to go with something like Seven Samurai. It's foreign, pretty well-known and regarded (yet, a lot of people haven't seen it), and the film has actually had a tremendous impact on the film industry - not only in the United States, but all over the world. When people think of foreign films, they think of artsy, French cinema with dialogue and plots and boring subtext. But they don't realize that films like Seven Samurai are also foreign films, and... well, it'd be hard to argue that Kurosawa's most recognizable work is a bore.

**Who are a few of the most important people in your AOE and why?**

&gt;**Akira Kurosawa;** revolutionized the samurai film as we know it, and has had a number of impacts on the film industry as a whole (think Fistful of Dollars, then think of Westerns in general, THEN think about Star Wars.

&gt;**Francois Truffaut;** cahiers critic who attacked French cinema for committing a crime of what he referred to as ""A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema"", where French filmmakers of the early 1940s-50s were making unrealistic and seamless films which worked to construct a fantasy of lives that can never be attained in real life.

&gt;**Jean-Pierre Melville;** A french filmmaker who was obsessed with American film noir, and constructed his films around characters like Humphrey Bogart. Aside from this, it could readily be argued that he was the godfather of the French New Wave (he later dismissed this title), inspiring directors like Truffaut and Godard to make films such as The 400 Blows and Breathless.

&gt;**Hou Hsiao-Hsien;** a Taiwanese director who makes films which revolve specifically around time, and how we perceive it. His films generally deal with our lost youth, or how over the years we've continued to pervert our search for true love and happiness. His films are entirely indicative of an era of contemporary evanescence, a gradual disappeareance of life itself.

**What are the sub-genres of your AOE with examples?**

&gt;**Horror;** I Saw the Devil, Battle Royale, Suspiria, High Tension

* Thriller; Oldboy, Santa Sangre

* Drama; Blue, Let the Right One In, Three Times, Army of Shadows

* Action; Seven Samurai, Le Samourai

* Comedy; Au Revoir Lenin!, Pierrot le fou, Going Places

**Roughly, how many films do you own in the genre you are applying for?**
&gt;80, give or take. I also rent a lot and view a lot on netflix.

**What kind of content do you plan on providing as an expert?**

&gt;[RECO], maybe some podcasts, host discussions, and maybe even try and get in on some of the netcasts and talk about foreign cinema. I'm also going to be in the chatroom a lot so people can always have a direct line to me in case there are questions and whatnot.

**How often will you provide that content?**

&gt;Either once a week, or once every other week if things get busy with school. This is in reference to the [RECO]'s and discussions. I'll still be in the chatrooms, etc."	t5_2sm9e	True

1349425711.0	10zgc4	I work at Scarecrow Video in Seattle, Wa. The largest video store on Earth.	Taodeist	23	2	31	"http://www.scarecrow.com/

http://imgur.com/1xMxG

I'm one of the baristas at the VHSpresso there. The store has just under 120,000 unique titles with about a total inventory of 250,000. I once owned my own little interdependent store where I had about 5,000 movies but that is long gone. But during my ownership I learned of Scarecrow Video and it's legend among other indie stores. When I moved to Seattle the first thing I did was go there and try and get a job. However I was told right away they hadn't hired anyone new in years because once you get a job there you never quiet. It's cinema Heaven. So I figured I could at least start an account and show off my movie knowledge and maybe slowly work my way in.

I lost my first rental on the bus two days later.

But a few months after I then saw they were putting in a coffee cart. Having been a barista once before and figuring they'd need new people I went home, wrote up a custom cover letter for my resume and got the job a few days later.

So while it is not my personal collection, I do get unlimited free rentals from it so I get to at least treat it like a personal collection. If I watched two movies a day, every day of the year, it would take 164 years to watch them all there. This place is huge. It has the entire Criterion Collection, hundreds of super rare VHS, DVDs, and other treasures, and everyone who works there is very laid back and fun when it comes to talking movies. No movie snobs. 

So while my personal collection is gone, unless this breaking some FAQ rule I didn't see, for usage sake, this is my collection.


1. Seattle, Wa

2. Sci Fi

3. Jurassic Park and Space Balls

4. High Fidelity

5. I saw Project X this year and wished for horrible things to happen to it.

6. Big Terry Gilliam fan but... Sam Raimi has more favorites of mine. 

7. Scarecrow had this all well, though not by a long shot is it the rarest they have, but I had 1984 (1984) with John Hurt and Richard Burton that I bought for $5 at a Target once. When I look about ordering it for a customer it was going for well over $250 on Amazon at the time.

8. Nothing.

9. Old collection was alphabetical by genre. Scarecrow is the same only with about four dozen more sub genre's. 

10. Scarecrow has their own inventory/rental system. I had VMT or something back in the day. "	t5_2sm9e	True

I live in Portland, Oregon, USA.

My Birthday is Nov. 24th

Choosing a favorite genre is hard for me because it really depends on my mood. I like comedies and action when i'm watching with friends, and chick flicks when with my girl friends, but when I'm in a bad mood or really stressed out I like the tearjerkers and rom-coms.

The first DVD I bought was The Iron Giant (which unfortunately was lost in the move from my childhood home.)

My guilty pleasure movie is The Parent Trap, because it reminds me of my childhood.

My least favorite movie I own is Sky High

My favorite director is Steven Soderbergh

What release I'm most proud of: Back to the Future Pt.I (got it for $5 on sale at Fred Meyer, and it came with a digital copy) or the Troy Directors cut box set (10$ at Goodwill)

What releases I'm looking for: I have a long list. Right now I am trying to find cheap copies of Argo and The Town.

How do you organize &amp; sort your
collection? 
Right now the Bottom shelf is organized as follows(L-R):
Dark/violent movies, to action, to action comedies, to comedies, to kids movies, to chick flicks, to tear jerkers.

The top shelf is organized alphabetically, and will be that way until I fill the shelf enough that I can really organize them better.

As for software and apps, I don't use any, I just keep word documents with lists I update and review. I do however use **Half.com** for a lot of my purchases.

I know I have quite a few mediocre movies, but I enjoy the occasional cheesy movie when I just want to zone out. Also, I am always open for recommendations!

If you do not ""play it forward"", you are basically stealing from everyone. From the next person who is wanting to watch movies, and write in the logbooks, from the people that started the ""chain"", because they are waiting to get two DVDs to replace the two they donated into the deal, and to this ENTIRE SUBREDDIT, because we want the logbooks as pieces of history.

What is going on? Do we have to shun people? Do we have to come scratch your DVDs? What's up? What to do we need to do to get it moving?

DVDJunky	21	0	64	"**First off, I don't want others to feel this is unfair so if there is a problem with me offering DVDs as incentive for voting for Dead Alive as the movie night pick then Charles or SLC feel free to veto this idea.**

I'm a Huge fan of Dead Alive's over the top ridiculousness. My good pal Disposable420 and I have been trying to get it picked as the Movie Night option since the whole thing started and it finally looks like it might actually happen.

I'm slightly concerned the turnout won't be as high as I would like so I've decided to send two lucky people Dead Alive on DVD. This may or may not be new. It will be the DVD copy. I will just be finding it online and shipping straight to you so I cannot confirm the disc condition.

I just want people to see this hilariously gory flick. A little bit about it for those of you that are in the dark:  
&gt;Dead Alive (Braindead to our foreign friends) is actually a really fun movie. It's Directed by none other than Peter Jackson (Yes, THAT Peter Jackson). It's a zombie film that has long been labeled the goriest movie ever made. It's HILIARIOUS. You will be quoting it for months and upon any future viewings will be shouting lines along with your friends (which you will be trying to get to watch constantly)
It's got a very respectable 86% freshness on rotten tomatoes and a not too shabby 7.6/10 rating on IMDb If you're a fan of Horror you should vote for Dead Alive. Fan of Comedy? Vote Dead Alive. Camp? Dead Alive. Cult? Dead Alive. Gore? Dead Alive. Peter Jackson? Dead Alive.

Alright, so if everyone is cool with it here are my overall rules.

* I'd like to to try your hardest to *actually* show up to the movie night.

* I'd like you to not already own Dead Alive.

* Please post a picture and explanation of a film from your collection that is not known as a ""well made movie"" that you consider one of your favorites. Please include your username in the photo.

I'll pick my favorite submissions and send the DVDs ASAP.

This is all subject to change as I see fit and I will only be doing so if Dead Alive wins. Please check back for updates.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for their submissions!! I've been reminded of a few movies I need to buy and added a few to my watch list as well.
The randomly chosen winners are Thinandbony and ProteusFinnerty.
THANKS FOR PLAYING - I hope to see you all on the movie night!!!"	t5_2sm9e	True

OK, let me comment on this a bit.

* The shirt? Awesome. Especially the back with the quote ""It's not the size that counts, it's how many people you show it to"".. PERFECT!

* Amelie - This is a fantastic, fantastic movie. I got to see it earlier this year and was truly blown away by it. If you have a chance, please, please watch it.

* Blue Valentine - I'm a sucker for a good romance drama. I dig The Last Kiss (The guy who did the screenplay for it also wrote Crash, Million Dollar Baby and Casino Royale) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Like Crazy (though not as much as the former two). Blue Valentine is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. It takes a look at the personal relationship between two people, and you get a before and after throughout the whole movie. It's a bit rough to watch, but it's one of my more recent favorite movies, and I'm so happy to own it.
* Chuck Season 4 - If you're subscribed to this forum, and you haven't watched Chuck, you should be ashamed of yourself. A video game and movie geek gets secrets from the CIA planted in his brain and he knows kung fu. Season 4 was the only season that I didn't have. I've literally been checking Amazon daily and monitoring C3 in case I miss a price drop. I'm so excited to watch through this.
* Kill Bill - OK, this is the difference between me and some other collectors. My favorite movies, I go all out for. I own all five Resident Evil movies on Blu, as well as the same movies in a steelbook. I own the US release of Drive, the UK steelbook, and the already-out-of-print Canadian Futureshop exclusive version of Drive. Kill Bill is one of my favorite movies of all time. When I saw this steelbook was coming out, I freaked out. It's Region B locked and exclusive to Germany, but I knew I had to have it in my collection.. and now I do!!

The Kill Bill steelbooks are easily the centerpiece of my collection. The singles releases were gifted to me by someone quite special, and TFK4L has gifted me the German steelbook.. in my eyes, that's it - this completes my Kill Bill collection. It's absolutely perfect. I will be getting a shadow box of some sort to display the steelbooks in.

[here](http://i.imgur.com/5bRRk.jpg) is my Kill Bill collection!

[here](http://i.imgur.com/z8qk1.jpg) is my now complete Chuck collection!

I can't eat the candy just yet, but soon!

Today was a very, very rough day for me, and receiving this package was amazing and very uplifting. This is easily the nicest random act of kindness that has ever happened to me. Thank you so much, TFK4L."	t5_2sm9e	True
