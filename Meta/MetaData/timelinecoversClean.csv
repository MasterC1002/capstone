[Cover](http://i.imgur.com/Ys82C.png)

[Empty Display Pic](http://i.imgur.com/Cy8yV.png) (put your face on here)

[B.J. Blaskowicz Face](http://i.imgur.com/JKXro.png) (as a template for your own face)

Tips:

- Don't use a 'real photo' of your face in the display pic template - even a pixelated version. I tried this at first and it just looks really strange. You have to do a pixelated video game version using the BJ template.

- Don't erase the gray around BJ's face in the template as the first step - it's useful to smudge into the face when you're sculpting it.

- As a man, you don't have to do too much to make B.J.'s face look like your own. Good luck if you're a woman. Here's the steps I took:

1. Use a perspective tool to make BJ's face thinner/thicker to match your own face size. This might not be enough: I also cut and 'slid in' the cheeks to make my face thinner, then smudged the middle of them to make them connect.

2. Use a smudge tool to make the face match your facial structure. Use the smudge tool to make your neck thinner. BJ has a thick neck and, although it's cool on him, it will just look too unrealistic for your display pic.

3. Use lasso/scissors select and select your hair, then colourize. I kept the hair the same so to add or take away from the hair you'll have to get creative with cloning/smudging or any other tool of choice.

4. The eyes are tough: I colourized the middle 3x3 pixels then copied the sides of this colourized block and cloned them to cover the outer edges of the eyes that are still blue. (I sort of messed up on the right eye and you can still see a line of blue at the bottom... but it's only a pixel high and hardly noticeable). My eyes were a bit too wide after this so I smudged a bit. If your eyes are also blue, well you're pretty lucky.

5. Facial hair isn't too hard: Just color some blocks and then smudge.

6. Erase all the gray around your face.

7. Scale the image down without and image interpolation to 25%. Then scale it up again %1000 without interpolation. This will give it back the pixelated look that smudging might have ruined. You can scale it back to normal size here, but programs like GIMP might remember what it looked like and keep the old quality, so it will go back to the smudged version. I just saved it really big and opened the image in the display pic background file and it kept the pixelated look.

- Some people hate using the smudge tool, so do whatever works for you. These are my steps for design newbs (for I'm one myself)

- When putting the cover on your Facebook page, drag it up all the way (cutting off the top). This ensures it will line up as best as possible with your display pic."	t5_2tcgp	True
