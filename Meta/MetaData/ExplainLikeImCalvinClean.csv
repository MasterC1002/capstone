But like the title says, some people here have obviously never read a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip before. The answers that people give sound NOTHING like something Calvins Dad would say.
 -Sexist answers
-Smart-ass answers
-Sexually related.

Calvin is like 6 years old and his dad would never say such things. I know the rules on this thread dont have any 'NSFW' rule on it, but come on. The goal is to sound like Calvins Dad, not PedoBear

It's really great to see so many awesome questions and answers, and I can't tell you how much I've learned here. This is truly the best source of absolute truth and knowledge (not constrained by facts) on Reddit. Keep em coming!

Also, I've noticed a lot of posts lately that don't follow the format specified in the sidebar. Remember - if you don't prefix your posts with ""ELIC:"" (or ""LIC:"") then Reddit's code will confuse our questions and answers with those in other less open-minded sections. This could cause a conflict between the ""truth"" in other Q&amp;A sections and the ""better than truth"" information found in our section, a collision that could ultimately unravel all space/time.

There wasn't a lot of response, so I'm guessing people didn't see it and it just got buried. My apologies again for lack of time to get this done, but I actually have been given 5 credits of Reddit Gold by the admins to give out to the best of our subreddit, so I'm thinking let's simplify this whole thing and focus on what we do best - *awesome answers*. Our Best of ELIC will be the top 5 answers for the past year.

Post your nominations below. This will run for 1 day, then I'll start a new voting-style thread to vote - the top 5 highest-voted answers will get their posters Reddit Gold. What the heck - feel free to nominate yourself.

The poster of the overall top-voted answer will also be named the honorary World's Best Dad for the year, just because I thought of it for the other post and like it (no extra Reddit Gold).

Will add more rules as I make them up on the spot...

Good luck!

Raelshark	29	5	1	"Okay, so the 1 day of nominations turned into 6, and rather than actually voting on the nominations I instead chose to turn the final decision over to a pack of wild monkeys, because as we all know - only their kind can be truly impartial in their analysis of voting results. After much much deliberating and fighting and throwing poo, the monkeys have returned with their judgments, and surprise! - the exactly five people nominated between the two threads have won for the *top five* answers. It's like it was meant to be (or we're all just incredibly lazy and/or disinterested).

These are our winners of an entire month's supply of **Reddit Gold**:

* sealclubber for the history of [Bricks and Mortar](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/umlwz/why_are_there_holes_in_bricks/c4wpfxx)

* shankingviolet for how [Dubstep Came from Whalesong](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/ut9u0/elic_what_is_dubstep/c4ycw3m)

* pcc987 for the difference between [Hipsters and Hippopotami](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/uwman/elic_whats_a_hipster/c4z82ut)

* Bananafanafofaser for the [History of the Joy-stick](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/147qls/elic_why_do_nintendo_64_controllers_have_three/c7aq0g6)

* ohdeargodhelpme for [Putting the Womb Back in Woomun](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin/comments/154b5v/elic_why_do_we_pronounce_one_woman_woomun_and/c7j71ry)

And to wrap this up, based purely on the number of nomination votes the winner of World's Best Dad (of the Year) is:

**pcc987**

Congrats! But you don't get anything extra, and your poll numbers are already slipping...

I'll be sending out the gold momentarily.

Remember - if you're unhappy with the results or our unorthodox approaches, the only option is [open revolt](http://i.imgur.com/MjxFf.gif).

Your eyes get red because of the blood vessels which flare up when the ... you see there are these tiny spiders that live inside your eyeballs. They live in there and most of the time you don't notice them, they are too small to feel them walking around and stuff, but when you stare at the sun the light, or swim the chlorine will get in there and it makes them mad. When thy get mad they want to get out of your eyes so they start biting at the walls of the eyes to try to bite their way out of your eyes. When they do this it hurts your eyes and they start to bleed on the inside. Some of that blood starts to come out a little from the blood vessels and that's why your eyes turn red.

You can take a look at the new theme and provide feedback over in our [test subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicchat/).

1356592789.0	15ict1	[META] Best of ELIC 2012 Announcement and Nominations	Raelshark	23	0	15	"Apologies to the community because I have seriously fallen behind on this, but the opportunity to recognize the amazing minds here is just too great to pass up.

Reddit usually has site-wide nominations and voting in several categories, but this year it's a bit different - each subreddit is listing and voting on its own categories. Which frankly is right up our alley, cause we don't do things normal here.

The best part is that we moderators are getting up to 5 credits of Reddit Gold to give out to the winners of the competition. Unfortunately that might require a short turnaround time on picking our winners, which I'm hoping to clarify soon. I'll update this post with the timeframes.

**Process**

So here's the process we'll be using - 

1. Post nominations as replies to the category comments I've posted below. Please provide links to sources or examples. Feel free to comment on the nominations. (Note: only posts created before this one will qualify for nominations.)
2. We'll take the top 5 highest-voted posts in each category and create separate posts for each category using a new contest-style post that Reddit has provided.
3. After a set period of time we'll post the winners and distribute the Reddit Gold.

**Categories**

Since we do things a bit different, we won't have the usual categories, so I'll also provide some explanations: 

* **Best Answer** - Pretty straight-forward, the best overall answer to one of Calvin's questions. This should be a truly insightful answer with absolutely no basis in science or reality in general.

* **World's Best Dad Award** - The user with the best overall answers and contributions to the subreddit.

* **Best Hole-Digging** - The best follow-up comment by a dad in response to a follow-up question to their original answer. These should be examples where a user takes their answer to the next level of awesomeness.

* **Worst Adherence to Fact** - The best case of a user posting a factual science-based response to a question, usually by not realizing what subreddit they're in. These are sometimes as amusing as the answers themselves.

And because the strongest point in this community is its creativity, I'd also like to open it up to suggestions for a final category. I'll post a submission comment for suggestions below. Once we tally the feedback we'll likely just pick one to use and run a separate nomination post for that special category.

Also feel free to post any comments below or message us with any other suggestions or feedback about this process.
