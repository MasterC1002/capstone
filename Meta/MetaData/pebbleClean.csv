[CloudPebble](http://cloudpebble.net) is an online application that aims to provide you with everything you need to do pebble development. You edit source files, upload resources, and compile on the site. It's still far from finished, but give it a try! It might especially be worthwhile if you're using some platform where compilation is hard, or you don't like command lines. It also handles resource_map.json for you!

Here are some screenshots:

- [Resources](http://i.imgur.com/MqsyK2A.png)
- [Compiling](http://i.imgur.com/mExA5In.png)
- [Creating a project](http://i.imgur.com/fBvEvxg.png)

It's *very much* still a work in progress, but I think it's interesting and usable already! Give it a whirl and let me know what you think. :)

Planned **future** features include in-line documentation/autocomplete, significantly improved resource viewing UI, import/export, GitHub support, …; I just need the time!

Note: use a recent-ish web browser to access it. Tested on Safari 6 and Chrome whatever-they're-on-now. You can use anything you like to download the compiled watchfaces, though.

**EDIT**: You can also now either follow [@CloudPebble](http://twitter.com/CloudPebble) on Twitter or look at [blog.cloudpebble.net](http://blog.cloudpebble.net/) for continued updates!

Many chip vendors make silicon consistent between product lines but simply flash different firmware to enable features. **Our chips were labeled CC2560 because TI asked us if we wouldn't mind using them with CC2564 firmware to speed up our order.

1367647439.0	1do0fm	THIS IS SO	Huchimo01	115	44	51	"I am reading these comments and just can't understand why. In the very beginning the Pebble crew told everyone just how this thing was going to work. Sure, the timeline is way off because, um, let's see, they wee bombarded with 100 times the amount of money they were asking for. So now they have to make 100 times the watches they were expecting right from the get-go.

They also said in very plain English that black would be the first color made. They said it just like that. BLACK FIRST!! It isn't rocket-science that the amount of people wanting this watch is so great. The idea is great. But nobody ever wants to wait as long as it takes. In reality-if you weren't prepared to wait for the watch, then why did you even back it? 

They were very to-the-point that things got out of hand when the orders just kept pouring in. The Septembe 2012 timeframe was for-sure a very bad guess at a delivery timeframe, but what do you expect? These guys weren't counting on this, and I can only imagine they wish they would have told people it would be even a longer wait. I would rather offer your money back than listen to people complaining about something they already knew. That is-the watches were not going to be shipped when they originally said they would be. 

They even gave an idea about what colors would be manufactured in what order. And guess what-that is exactly what is happening. I say to Pebble-Give these folks their money back and put names in their places with people who won't whine about it. 

From where I am sitting these Pebble guys are doing a pretty darn good job considering all the hoopla around their idea. I would have pooped myself for sure by now. Heck, maybe they already have. So give them a break and let them do their job. You'll have your watch soon and you'll forget there ever was a delay. Now go watch a movie and just forget abou' dit.

Just wanted to make people aware of a new version that should hit the Android Play store at any time (or you can download it now via this link: https://code.google.com/p/android-pebble-notifier/ ). Here are the new features:

- Ability to send notifications without the use of Tasker (requires you to enable an accessibility service)

- Ability to exclude all notifications from certain applications (only outside of Tasker)

- Ability to only send notifications from certain applications (only outside of Tasker)

- If you like my work and would like to donate, this is now a donate button in app!

Setting up profiles which would allow people to setup their white or black list of applications, then use Tasker to flip between those profiles whenever they chose."	t5_2txls	True
1373039576.0	1hp243	Now that BestBuy is handling some of the distribution, it's time for Pebble to focus on developers	saltedlolly	64	6	18	"Now that a large part of their distribution can now be handled by BestBuy, the Pebble team should now be freed up to begin focussing more fully on developing their App ecosystem. While BestBuy can help them get the device on to as many wrists as possible, Pebble need to make sure that there are cool, useful Apps available to their users. To do this they need developers to want to build them, and so must do everything they can to provide developers with the tools and support they need. The current hardware is definitely good enough for a 1st Gen device, but its true potential has not yet been realised. The existing API is still quite limited, with much of the hardware unavailable to developers. Pebble urgently need to:

-  Improve PebbleKit, introducing the promised emulator to make developing and debugging Pebble Apps easier for developers.
- Give watch apps an easy way to access the internet via the phone
- Improve notification support for iPhone users (iOS7 will help with this, presumably)
- Enable magnetometer, accelerometer and Bluetooth LE via Firmware, and make them available to developers via the API
- Build a Pebble App store to make finding/buying/installing Apps easy for users. This will also provide a revenue stream (and incentive) for developers as well as for Pebble themselves.
- Improve customer support (Get Satisfaction / Uservoice might help)
- Enable IFTTT support, as promised
- Improve the built-in apps (e.g Peapod replaces music App, better alarm clock etc.)

Watchface Apps have a certain wow factor but once you've picked the ones you like you rarely change them. Pebble's real usefulness will stem from Apps that can offer functionality that replace or duplicate a task that would typically require you to reach for your phone, so you no longer need to to - you can just look at your wrist instead.

There are several different App types that developers should be able to develop. These can be Apps that:

- pull data from the internet and display it in useful ways (e.g. weather app, stock ticker)
- interact directly with online services (e.g. foursquare check-in app)
- act as secondary display for phone apps (e.g. Runkeeper, Caddie Finder)
- capture data from the watch sensors (e.g. Swim computer, Fitbit-esque tracker, Sleep tracker)

Once the APIs exist so that developers can create all four types of app easily, then we will really see some creative and unanticipated uses for Pebble, making it an even more desirable device. Time is not on Pebble's side though - they need to move quickly. With big players, with bigger budgets, entering the space, their only hope is to build a vibrant dev community behind Pebble, before its too late."	t5_2txls	True

Reasons to ship the SDK:

 * Keep promises to community
 * Get people interested in developing
 * Get an early start on competitors
 * Open the platform up to 3rd parties

Reasons to not ship the SDK:

 * The firmware on the watch isn't finished [Pebble is embarrassed to share it]
 * Conditional agreement of a possible acquisition [i.e. Apple]
 * Exclusivity deals with 3rd party developers [i.e. RunKeeper]

* **May 21, 2013:** I receive my first response from Pebble, asking for a video of the problem.
* **May 22, 2013:** I send a video of the issue and request an RMA.
* **May 22, 2013:** I receive a response from Pebble support allowing me to fill out the RMA form and the instructions to verify the serial number of my Pebble.
* **May 23, 2013:** I send the info requested above and fill out the RMA form.
* **June 12, 2013:** No response in regard to my RMA request, so I send an email asking what the holdup is.
* **June 13, 2013:** Pebble has me confirm a few extra details and says that I ""should receive more info soon when he [the person working with RMAs] approves it for shipping.""
* **June 14, 2013:** My RMA is approved and I receive this message: &gt; ""Our fulfillment house will be sending you a FedEx shipping label within the next business day or two."" This is followed by the instructions on how/what to send back to Pebble when I receive this box. 
* **July 11th, 2013:** Today, I make this Reddit post as a last resort in order to accomplish the following things:
     * 1a. Receive a functional Pebble after over TWO MONTHS of absolutely nothing but unfulfilled promises from Pebble support.
  * 1b. Further point out that Pebble really needs to beef up their customer service, as with them being in Best Buy now, they can no longer function with the professionalism of a sketchy eBay user- they are    a legitimate company and must fulfill the promises they make to their customers.

* All of my Pebble Support correspondence was with Muba Razavi, with the exception of my final Pebble support response (June 14th), which was from Ali.

Pebble, please help me as you have done nothing but make me lose respect for your growing company throughout this pathetic display of customer support.

Our inner-hipster will, for some time at least, be sure to tell everyone our Pebble is the Kickstarter Edition and that we used this sub before all the 'box opening', 'watchface design', 'should i get a pebble', and 'app ideas' posts flooded it.

Before we move to that era, we should take a moment to look around and be proud of the community we're in.  Formally, we must give a HUGE thank you to /u/erOhead and his team for all the hard work they've been doing to get Pebbles onto our wrists.  
Eric, thanks for always being genuine, forthright, and honest when talking about your product.  We look forward to using them and if we could do it all over, we'd back you again.

To, /u/TeamPebble and the other mods, thanks for keeping this place enjoyable.  Good luck in the future (its probably about to get crazy).  We'll try our best to be patient with you guys and not cause too much trouble.

Gentlemen, here's to watchfaces, apps, and changing your music from the shower.  This sub has a promising 2013.

I'm not bragging, I'm not a rich man, it's just a crazy place to do this job. My phone rings dozens of times a day and I do everything I can to respond to every call. Let's not even talk about the texts and emails. 

There are two things I hate about using my phone so much (though for the most part I love using my phone:) I have to have the ringer all the way up or I miss calls, and I constantly feel phantom vibration. 

Pebble changed my life. I don't think this is the case for everyone. My unique situation is tailor made for the watch. No longer am I pulling my phone out mid conversation for junk mail, looking like the rudest man on earth. A quick glance at my watch goes completely unnoticed and I can screen all the non essentials. 

These past three days, for the first time in years, I have been able to leave my phone on Silent. The ringer doesn't blow up in the middle of restaurants, elevators and offices. I feel like I've been released from a personal prison. 

No longer do I find myself hanging up and slipping the phone in my pocket Only to pull it back out again- over and over ad nauseum. I know which calls are essential with a fifth of the effort. 

And now my watch tells the weather and has a zoidberg face. 

Thank you Pebble."	t5_2txls	True

1370377720.0	1foavs	Thanks Pebble/Review	EdwinForTheWin	52	13	10	"This subreddit has been slow lately and I figured we hadn't seen a review or a thanks pebble post in a while so I figure I'll put in my 2 cents.

Let me start off saying I'm 15 *(gasp)* and live in Canada. I haven't really worn watches my whole life, the odd one to a birthday party or whatnot. Nor did I ever have a lot of money. When pebble was announced/launched on Kickstarter in April of last year, I missed the chance to grab my place since I wasn't really ""in"" on the tech world, didn't browse the web too much. I mostly worked my butt off cleaning and doing school work. I digress.

Anyway, when I heard that Pebble was shipping on the 26th of January I began to research it more. I learned everything there was about pebble from what it could do, to the specs. I saved up some money and bought one off of eBay for $300 around 2 months ago. It shipped easily within a week and boy was I excited.

I turned it on, and already had IFTTT ready with my triggers. Turned all 15 of them on (I now wanted my watch to replace my phone) and then hit a wall. I realized that at the time, pebble couldn't do much (this was a month before the release of the first SDK). It impressed my family, my friends, anyone who noticed it, but for the most part it just blends in like any other watch. Then it became part of my life.

Pebble worked just as I expected, but not completely how I wanted it. Pebble did its job, and did it well, but didn't do much. So then came the SDK. I came home, fired up /r/pebble (which I went on probably 15+ times a day for new news) and found that the SDK was released. I installed the few watchfaces that were available at the time and I was a happy camper. Finally there was more to show people, and pebble could now do so much.

As the weeks went on I still browsed /r/pebble, the forums and MyPebbleFaces for the latest and greatest watchfaces, and boy did I love it. Everyday I would have a new watchface, new game or app. I'm poor at french and let's just say that pebble came in handy for a couple tests so far. I felt like I was wearing what was like the iPhone when it was just released.

But what I thought was a cool aspect to look at pebble was that it is something I'll be telling my kids/grandkids (hopefully) about. My dad tells me how he thought it was cool back in the day to be able to play asteroids on his Commodore-64, and then I look at pebble and see how it would be something that I will say instead; ""I remember installing asteroids on my black-and-white screened pebble, and now look where technology is."" 

Now I have an orange gadgetwrap on my pebble, with the RobotoBig watchface. I have Timer, Pebbloid, Notifications (pebble reminder), DropType, Orbtime, Glance, and Watchnote on my pebble.

Sure there were complaints, sure there are now. There always will be. But what I take out of Pebble is that it has changed my life (and possibly the world). Not in the aspect of being able to see my notifications but more in where the world is headed in the means of technology.

So thanks TeamPebble for all the hard work you have put into it. Thanks for an awesome product.

**TL;DR:** Pebble worked fine when I got it, became better with SDK's, I love my pebble, changed my life, changed the world, thanks pebble.

If you've read this far, that's awesome. Thanks.

1361889267.0	199d6j	Rather than write a post whining about the lack of response from support I figured I'd offer some suggestions regarding my experience	pursuelubu	51	12	26	"To Pebble:

I have been working in the support industry for a little over 12 years now working with companies from startup to large corporations with infrasturcture, optimization and operations to ensure support teams are able to handle the issues that come from day to day operations as well as maintain a level of service to ensure clients/customers do not walk away feeling let down by their service.

Having my own experience with your support system and taking a few guesses on how your backend works I figured I might point out some simple tweaks that I employ anytime I take on a new company which provide some customer satisfaction as well as organization which may be of use to you guys:

1. Send a confirmation upon initial submission referencing some sort of id number to your ticket so that clients are aware and also able to respond directly to that issue instead of continually submitting new tickets. It creates whitenoise/backlog otherwise. I first submitted a ticket 14 days ago today and never got a reply. I sent one a few days later thinking maybe it didn't go through. Thinking then perhaps my email address was being filtered as it was a .info domain I used my work email twice. Because of my uncertainty of my problem being addressed you obtained 3 extra tickets with the same exact issue and I'm sure other people have sent far more than 4 submissions.

1. Stop using email support. While this creates a ""personal"" feel to support it is very hard to manage and clients can miss a response. It is better to use a system that is tracked with a login as it becomes centralized and easier for a client/customer to pull up their ticket history should they need to relate to a past issue. This is something very important as iPhones typically aren't configured to go past 2 weeks in history but also opens up to suggestion 3.
1. Use a form that has a sort of automated system to assign a priority to a ticket based on what a user selects as their issue in a webform. This allows for a much more organized flow in responding to issues and making sure that people with larger issues are handled in a timely manner over those continually emailing asking when their watches are shipping.
1. Lastly, set SLA to responses. I.e ""Thanks for contacting Pebble support! We have received your submission and applied id #274721 to this issue. Due to the current amount of submissions with your reported issue we expect a first contact within the next 72 hours."" Even then, it doesn't need to be a response that 100% resolves the issue. For example when contacting Parallels in regards to support with Plesk they will say ticket has been created. First response is always ""I am looking into it please wait for the next 24 hours."" Second response is always ""I have identified the issue and reported it to &lt;group&gt; you should have a response in &lt;x&gt; days."" Just providing that one/two people that do triage for the larger group as a whole makes the client feel progress is being done when all that was really done is their ticket was identified and placed in the proper group so that they can be handled.

I hope perhaps these suggestions may find of some use to you, they're very simplistic changes to a support system which brings about a lot of satisfaction in practice."	t5_2txls	True

Based on my estimations (assuming $115 / pebble etc...) the batches seem to break down like this (note, the count didn't fit into 15k evenly, the first line of each batch after 1 shows the total amount for that day, but my calculation subtracts the estimated amount that shipped in the previous batch):

**Batch 1** (estimated ship: 1/23)

* 4/18 - $806,615 ~ 7,014 pebbles
* 4/19 - $533,349 ~ 4,638 pebbles
* 4/20 - $308,756 ~ 2,685 pebbles
* 4/21 - $173,648 ~ 1,510 pebbles

**Batch 4** (estimated ship: 2/6)

* 4/21 - $173,648 ~ 1,510 pebbles
* 4/22 - $180,514 ~ 1,570 pebbles
* 4/23 - $228,746 ~ 1,989 pebbles
* 4/24 - $170,616 ~ 1,484 pebbles
* 4/25 - $140,615 ~ 1,223 pebbles
* 4/26 - $154,464 ~ 1,343 pebbles
* 4/27 - $121,516 ~ 1,057 pebbles
* 4/28 - $109,185 ~ 950 pebbles

* 5/8 - $641,827 ~ 5,581 pebbles

**Batch 6** (estimated ship: 2/20)

* 5/8 - $641,827 ~ 5,581 pebbles
* 5/9 - $534,658 ~ 4,649 pebbles

Since email isn't perfect, I wanted to post the content of that message here. It gives me something to link to in the event someone hasn't properly received the message. Another reason for posting it here is that the information contained is helpful to all Pebblers still waiting.  
  
When logging into their Pebble account dashboards, pre-order customers will notice that the ""Number Left in Batch"" sidebar has been replaced by [a timeline with new ETAs.](http://i.imgur.com/WY23eFX.png) Hopefully this graphic makes it clear to all that delivering Pebble to our Kickstarter backers first—before any pre-orders—is still the plan. 
  
The team is aware some FAQs on our Help pages will require updates in light of this new info. Hopefully, having this post here will be useful in the meantime.  
  
»»  
  
Thank you for your patience and continuing support!  
  
First we would like to apologize for not being able to meet the estimated ship date for your pre-order. We hope that you can understand why we needed to ship to our Kickstarter backers first.  
  
Without the initial support from our crowdfunding campaign we would not be where we are today, so it was really important for us to honor our commitment to early backers by ensuring they received Pebble as soon as possible.  
  
We are pleased to announce we're nearly through our Kickstarter orders and ramping up to start shipping pre-orders out to you this Spring. To date we've manufactured over 50,000 Pebbles and are working on adding more and more useful features and watch faces to Pebble everyday. You can follow our manufacturing process at [www.ispebbleshipping.com](http://www.ispebbleshipping.com/). As soon as the 'manufactured' column ticks past 85,000, we will begin shipping to our pre-order customers like you.  
  
We've also recently made a number of progress announcements. If you are not already following our Updates on Kickstarter, please take a moment and [read more about our upcoming SDK, OS 1.9 release, interface enhancements, and cool new watch faces here!](http://kck.st/110iumW)  
  
At any time, you can log onto the Pebble account system to change your shipping address or change your order details at [http://account.getpebble.com.](https://account.getpebble.com/)  
  
We are very proud of Pebble and can't wait to get it on your wrists so you can be proud to wear it too!  
  
If you have further questions, please visit our support center at [http://help.getpebble.com](http://help.getpebble.com) or our popular FAQ at [http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/1008241-top-pre-order-faq](http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/1008241-top-pre-order-faq).

1362609374.0	19sz09	Basic UI/Features Request.	almightywhacko	42	4	48	"I know that apps are supposed to be developed by the community in order to add additional functionality to the Pebble, but there are a few things that the watch does now that it could do a lot better. Some of these I have seen in individual complaints or tacked onto other topics but here is a list of things I would like to see added to the basic (ie: out of the box) functionality of the watch.

* Static battery indicator on main menu screen. (seen this request a lot)

* Option to have back light turn on at button press but NOT through accelerometer shake. My back light goes on far too frequently and often when I am not looking at the watch.

* Back light duration. Right now I think it is set to about 2 seconds however this is often too short for me to read the time. Maybe offer a toggle like 2s (default), 5s, 10s.

* On main-menu screen, pressing the left button should return you to your previously selected clock face screen without having to select that face again from the list.

***EDIT**: It looks like the left button request will make it into the 1.8.2 firmware*

* Sub-menus for Watch Faces and Apps. Currently these are just thrown into the same menu as with other basic watch features like Settings and Music control, however as more apps and watch faces become available this menu could grow to lengths that would be hard to navigate with the buttons on the right.

***EDIT**: It looks like the sub-menus request will make it into the 1.8.2 firmware*

* Option to turn off vibration. Additionally, vibration options for different types of notifications. For instance you might want vibration on for phone call notifications but off for emails.

* Font Size change should give an indication of the difference between the two options. This could be as easy as making ""small"" displayed in the small font and ""large"" displayed in the large font.

* ""Classic Analog"" watch face with no second hand in order to extend battery life. I know this is a ""new"" watch face request, but Classic Analog ships with the watch and epaper screens use more power when the screen updates, which means every second when you have a watch face with a second hand.

* This is for the Pebble smartphone app, but a notification when there is a firmware update (that gets pushed to your Pebble) would be very handy as well!

* Another app suggestion: It would be amazing to have the option to get notifications sent to your Pebble when new apps and/or watch faces are made available.

All in all I am very pleased with my Pebble and I think it is a great product!

However these are some basic UI and functionality issues I have run into with my own device. Some of this stuff just feels unfinished and it would be great if this was addressed."	t5_2txls	True

The BB had 4 watches; there was one guy there trying to buy all 4.  But that wasn't enough.  He had the BB employee searching other stores in the city for inventory and telling him to hold them; he wanted those as well.

I show up, say I only want one, and the BB guy says he has to call his manager to see if he can sell all 4 to one guy.  The guy gets mad, says the ad didn't have a limit, etc.  I'll exclude the expletives he spewed.

The BB guy came back and said he could sell each of us 2 of them (I only wanted one).  The guy went ballistic, cursing and threatening to sue them.  At that point the BB supervisor said they could no longer talk to him and took the watches off of the counter and put them on the shelf behind them.  I told the other guy I still wanted only one.  He grabbed one and rang me up while the other guy marched off to threaten the manager.

As I was leaving (with my Pebble!), he was having it out with the manager in the middle of the store.  I'm not sure how it turned out; I was worried he would follow me out and threaten me for mine.

Kudos to Best Buy for not giving in and selling them all to him.  If any BB people are reading this, I hope you'll continue that practice.  While I resented Pebble for selling watches to BB while I (and many others) were still waiting for some kind of word about ours, Pebble could learn a lot about customer service from this experience.

Oh, and that resentment?  All gone once I powered up my Pebble and started playing with it.  Love it!!!  Had a Metawatch Strata before -- there's no comparison.  Already ordered some GadgetWraps and might get that wood dock somebody's selling.

The bush was full of thorns and a branch ripped the pebble off my wrist. I was more concerned with the scratches on my body and didn't realize the pebble wasn't on my wrist. I got to our stop and realized I didn't have it. So I had to hike back to where I fell. My phone connected back to the pebble, so i knew I was close. Then I kept hitting the notifications tester buttons in the app and listened for the vibrations of the watch. FOUND MY PEBBLE! I was thinking earlier that day about turning off the vibes so I didn't get double between my phone and the watch, but I usually have my watch attached to me more than my phone, so I decided to keep it for now and maybe turn off the vibes on my phone. Good thing I didn't turn them off on the watch or I wouldn't have found it so quickly. Once I get the video on youtube I'll post it here. I had scratches on my left arm (watch arm) and show them on the cam. You can see I don't have my watch on in the vid, but I just didn't notice. So happy I found it.

-I now manage my email much more proactively- unsubscribing from every email I don't want. Spam-ish emails are not that big of a deal on a computer or phone, but annoying as hell when they buzz your wrist. 

-Find myself grabbing my phone to check email &amp; texts only to realize I have nothing to check- I have seen them all, or at least the first bit, and any important ones I read immediately. Kinda wierd- there is never anything new waiting. You know what's there before ever looking at your phone. *would love the ability to delete or flag emails from pebble- similar to answer and dismiss during phone calls.

-The old ""sorry I didn't see your call/text/email"" excuse is no longer valid. 
Found myself about to say it to someone, pausing and thinking how bad of a lie that is now, and going forth with the lie cause they didn't know what my pebble was yet. But soon enough, if it hasn't happened already, pebble is going to get someone in trouble. 

-And the most important, I look at my phone much less in my car now. Not only do I not have to pick it up ever, but it has made me listen to music more cause skipping tracks is so much easier. Really has worked beautifully with 3 Bluetooth devices in my car- zero conflicts.

Anyone else notice similar stuff?

http://i.imgur.com/HHLAQIT.jpg

I was a backer very early on 4/11 PST, I live in California and received it today.  For what it's worth, my account on getpebble.com still shows that my device is on step 3, ""Processing Shipment"".   I got the shipping notification the day after it hit USPS.

So, I'm using Android 4.2.1 on a Verizon Galaxy Nexus.  (AOKP JB-MR1 Build 2).  I normally wear a watch, so this is replacing a thin, minimalist Skagen watch.


We'll start with the good news:  Pros:

* It's here!  As a backer of many stuck and in-limbo Kickstarters, that's huge.
* Pairing to my phone did end up requiring a reboot before it paired correctly, but meh, no big deal.
* The vibration is good and strong, easy to notice
* It's great having instant access to review SMS and caller ID on your wrist.  But like all instant-access-tech, it's also a curse to be constantly reminded.  :-)
* The magnetic-charger is cool, and only slightly touchy to get to sit right. 
* The 'flip your wrist' to turn on the backlight is cool, and easy to activate.
* The special ""Kickstarter Edition"" acknowledgement on the back is really fun.




Cons: 

* The software stack isn't super robust yet.  For instance, it requires that you run the stock Messaging app rather than my current favorite SMS app for the notifications to work correctly.  I'm sure this'll get addressed, but for now, a mild irritation.  Watch face selection's pretty basic, hopefully the community will make this awesome quickly.
* It's a pretty thick and chunky-looking thing.  Was hard to tell from the photos, but it sits pretty high on my wrist, I'm sure it won't be long before I catch it on something and mar the very shiny surface.
* The buttons are a bit chunky and fiddly.  Possibly a result of the waterproofing, but for whatever reason, they don't feel great to me.
* Don't like the stock band much.  I've got a replacement on the way.
* So far, I've not found any way of monitoring battery level or charging.

Meh:

* It leaves another notification icon in the bar and in the drawer.
[Edit: Apparently, you can disable this in Android 4.2 by a long-press on the notification and shutting the notifications off]
* The backlight doesn't stay on for long enough.


I don't want my mail sent to my watch, so I can't comment on that.  Reading an SMS on the screen with the small font is no problem though.

From Casio WQV to Motorola MotoACTV and so on.

That said, I've ordered two skins, a clear and a brushed steel from Skinomi just to keep this kickstarter edition in decent shape while I wait for orders to finally settle down before ordering another, and this time to skin it immediately after opening the box :p

I've tried and used a few requests from the community such as a sidebar with FAQ and rules, and that wish has been granted.

In the past couple of days we have had 2 or 3 posts that have been answered in the sidebar. 

If you post, and break the rules, you'll get a warning. 3 warnings is a temporary ban, and 5 you're banned as I figure you're trolling (because who screws up not reading it 5 times, really)

Upvote for visibility if you wish.

We've sent a bunch of e-mails, tweets, but communication is completely lacking.

My Pebble arrived yesterday afternoon (or the notification that it was at the post office did anyway)

Getting a new product off the ground isn't a simple process and while we've waited a little longer than first anticipated for our watches I have little to no problems at all with the way things have been handled and the road that's been taken.
I am far from the most patient of people (as my family will attest) but I hardly think that 6 months (I think) 'late' is still pretty damn good.

For comparison, I draw your attention to Duke Nukem. :)

Also lets not forget that this is a first generation product (Produced by a small group of people rather than backed by a big name like SONY or Apple)and its bound to have teething issues as expectation meets reality and I for one am pretty stoked to be part of the process by which this product improves and grows.

After a few hours use, I have two *minor* niggles which arise not from the product itself but rather from the way *I* like to use technology and the fact that this is the first time I've worn a watch in nearly a decade.

I look forward to sharing any idea's that I have for Pebble in the hopes that it may help in the future.

So Thanks to all the guys on the pebble team for making this product a reality and sticking with it.

So I have had my black Pebble since early March. And it did have one minor incident in the beginning, but it has been pretty amazing thus far. I would like to go ahead and give my two cents and review the Pebble in a few different categories: functionality, durability, battery life.

The functionality that the Pebble has is awesome as it is. And it will only get better as updates roll out and more developers get to working on producing apps for it. With Runkeeper out now and the plethora of watch faces, there is something for almost everyone. Although there are all these new apps, I keep it fairly simple. I use my Pebble as my notifier of text and calls. I use the music control everyday. Every so often I use the built in alarm. And the watch face that I use is simplicity since it has the nice layout and gives me the date. While some might say that I don't use the Pebble to its full extent, I am more than thrilled (even three months later) with how useful Pebble is. I keep my phone on silent 24/7 now since the vibrating motor in the Pebble is great. And since I see all my notifications from my phone on the watch, I get better battery life on my phone since I'm not constantly turning it on to see something. Functionality: √

Durability has surpassed my expectations tremendously. Before I got my Pebble, I read that it was scratching very easily for some people. Water has also been an issue for some users too. I'm here to say that my Pebble has been through it all in these past three months. I work for my city's parks and recreation department, so I'm always doing something physical whether it be inside or out. And it hasn't been damaged whatsoever nor do I have a screen protector. I have even ran into things with it too. I use the music controls every time I take a shower, I have swam with it, I have been in the sand with it, I workout/ play tennis with it, sleep with it and everything in between. Perfectly fine Pebble. Durability: √

Lastly, the battery life. Ever since I got my watch, the battery life just kept increasing and increasing with updates. And it has gotten as high as 11 straight days of usage. My average now is about 9-10 days of heavy usage. I have done a few modifications to extend the battery like only sending notifications to my watch when my phone screen is off, turn the backlight off during the day and I think the watchface Simplicity has something to do with it because of how little animations it does. Battery life: √

Now I understand that there are going to be some faulty Pebbles out there, and what not. I may just be extremely lucky with my Pebble. Who knows. But I am 100% pleased with the Pebble and I'm patiently waiting for my white Pebble preorder. If you have read all of this, somewhat in depth review, then thanks a lot. I just want to give a different perspective on the Pebble. :)"	t5_2txls	True

**FAQ:**

**Watch Band:** http://www.ebay.com/itm/261154299564?var=560178509863&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649

**Pebble Delivery Date:** February 9th, 2013

**Pebble Backer Number:** 7223 (On pebble box)

**Phone:** GSM Galaxy Nexus (rooted, running Android 4.2, **Bluetooth  v3.0** with A2DP.)

**Usage:** Watch face is **text watch** with **backlight on auto** and 10-50 notifications a day. My backlight gets triggered a lot as well but a whole lot less with backlight on auto. 

**Impressions for daily use:**

**Pros:** Battery life since charging 4-5 times has increased from 4-5 days to about 5.7 to 6 days. It helps while driving (not only do I check my phone a lot less, but I can control music while driving means more eyes on the road, will update with picture tomorrow morning.) New UI makes the watch much easier to use, I can stay on text watch and go check date with just 3 clicks. The fact that with a flick of my wrist I get a backlight is really handy. The watch has kept up with my daily use and the occasional knocks against wood, metal, drywall. I would highly suggest a screen protector as the watch face does scratch from daily use.

**Cons:** The paint on the metal magnets has come off (not a big deal, I can just paint black on them again if I really want.) I wish more watch faces had 12 hours and ability to add a small day and date readout on each face, but I understand the limits right now. If only it could be heavier (I came from a full stainless steel watch that I wore for 6 years, I liked the weight.) Maybe a way to add more weight to the watch in v2 (not the band, but the actual watch face.) 

**Small Stuff:** I wish I had applied a wet screen protector right the first time and held down all 4 corners of the watch for 5-10 minutes, but I did not and had to reapply the upper left corner 3 times, which caused it to not stick. Ill reapply another one some day. When daylight savings time switched here in Chicago, even though my watch was synced with my phone it never switched until I reconnected it. Not a big issue cuz I assume the time only gets updated on the watch when connected to a phone (why would you want it any other way except during daylight savings, it would waste more battery life to constantly update the time.) 2 times since I have owned the pebble after receiving a gchat message the watch gets a white screen and starts vibrating for 30 seconds and then restarts and disconnects from my phone, I assume this is a small bug so not really a issue. 

**Chargers:** I bought this charger when I worked for **[best buy for $6](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dynex%26%23153%3B---Dual-USB-Universal-Wall-Charger/2525266.p?id=1218332540505&amp;skuId=2525266)** but thanks to ebay if you can wait a couple days get this **[life tech charger one for $10](http://www.ebay.com/itm/For-Navigon-2000-2100-2120-2300-2310-2400-Dual-USB-Home-Wall-Charger-w-Cable-/310640619194?pt=US_GPS_Chargers_Batteries&amp;hash=item48539faeba).** 2000 mah means 1000mah for each device plugged in and all in 1 port which means really fast charging to both my phone and pebble or my tablet/pebble/phone/kindle/ect."	t5_2txls	True

Problem: When you click the box to enable gmail notifications for an account, you will be greeted with a password box. No problem right? unless you use 2 step auth. your account password will not work, and there is no way to see what password you used/created before on your phone.

Solution: Go to accounts.google.com and create a new password for an application (2 step auth users should understand this). plug in the new password when you enable your gmail notifications for the account that uses 2 step auth, and woot! your done. now gmail notifications work.

this might be confusing for people who do not use 2 step auth (shame on you for not!), but should be straight forward for people who know what i am talking about. I looked at help.getpebble.com and didnt see a guide there, probably should be added.

edit: my post before had the solution as revoking your gmail password, then creating a new password to use for both gmail authentication in the phone AND the pebble. i wasnt thinking at the moment, and should have stated that it is better to create a password for each, rather than giving an app access to gmail with the same password."	t5_2txls	True

1365314561.0	1bu9nn	Tip: Hiding deep scratches	frank26080115	34	6	10	"Usually when I hit my wall (my desk is in the corner beside a wall, right by my left hand, where I wear my Pebble), the Pebble handles it just fine without any scratches. But this time I hit a stone pillar outside, and it got some deep scratches.

The scratches were too deep for any conventional polishing techniques. I could try sanding it and then running it under a buffing wheel, but I do not have access to one. So I was pretty sad, especially because I already ordered some screen protectors for it.
The first lesson here is that, if you want a Pebble, you want a screen protector as soon as possible.

With that said, I'm not the kind of person who just gives up. When the screen protector arrived, I did an experiment.

Petroleum jelly, aka Vaseline, has a similar refractive index to most plastics. I know this because I know that you can repair scratched LCD monitors by spearing Vaseline over it. The Vaseline will fill the scratch, and since the refractive index is matched, the light travels through it without bending or reflections, this makes the scratch invisible. I smeared some Vaseline over my Pebble, and the scratches disappeared. Great!

The next problem is that the Vaseline will rub off and wash off eventually, unless you cover it up somehow. So the next part of the trick is to install a screen protector to cover up the Vaseline. So clean the screen with soapy water to get rid of any oil, dry it off, smear some Vaseline on it, apply the screen protector, and squeeze out any bubbles. Then let it sit still for an entire day or two. Make sure your hands are clean and no dust ever lands on it while doing this.

I highly recommend using [Gadget Wraps](http://www.gadgetwraps.com/devices/pebble-watch.html) for this, because their ""wraps"" is two parts, one part is a sticky decorative part (the brushed metal one looks amazing on a black Pebble) and a second part which is a clear screen protector. The sticker has a rectangular cutout in the center, where the screen protector sits in, in the end, everything is perfectly smooth. This makes my method of hiding scratches much easier because the sticker traps the screen protector, making it easier to squish out the bubbles.

I have been thinking about cool uses for httpebble and things people might like to see quickly by looking at their watch. Someone the other day recommended that I make a Gas Finder so I went to work and created something I have already found useful for myself.

This watch app will easily allow you to find the closest &amp; cheapest gas station to your current location.

Launch the app and it will start searching for the closest gas station - when found it will display the station name, distance &amp; direction from your current location and regular, premium and diesel prices (if applicable).

It will then start to search for the cheapest gas station in a 10 mile radius and display the same information on the bottom half of the watch.

Note: Requires httpebble to be installed on your device. Please choose the watch app that applies to your phone as the default one is for Android and there is an alternate iOS version due to the UUID used to communicate with httpebble on your device.

I put in an RMA hoping that I would see some of the newly promised improvement in the system but after 7 days I just now received what seems like a stock message asking me for information which was clearly communicated in the original support ticket.

I clearly noted all of the troubleshooting I had done (3 button reboot, factory reset, battery drain and recharge) but was asked if I had done all of these. 

Very frustrating that it's no business as usual at Pebble.

Edit #0: Seems the Mods felt that their time should be spent adding ""Rand on Pebble"" tag to this posting. It was NOT my tagging. Not very classy of them. Funny how other posts critical of Pebble don't seem to be tagged as such.

Edit #1: I finally got an RMA request on 7/23 which I tried filling out but it seems there is some issue with Pebble's image upload service under Firefox on OS X. Fortunately Safari was able to upload the request image.

Edit #2: Well, I got a SECOND RMA for the same issue on 7/25. I have no idea what's going on now. I've asked for clarification.

Edit #3: Guess my emails resulted in Pebble figuring out what was going on. I received a shipping notice of my new Pebble yesterday. Total time from reporting to shipping: 14 days.

Edit #4: And I receive my Pebble today - total time: 20 days. However the replacement Pebble DOES NOT have Kickstarter edition printed on it. This is unacceptable and I will be complaining.

1371922997.0	1gv54r	PebbleBarn.com - Clearing the Air	PebbleBarn	49	22	20	"Hi everyone, I'm Brad from PebbleBarn.  Since we got off to a little bit of a rough start, I wanted to come on here and hopefully clear the air a little bit about our site and maybe answer a few questions assuming anybody has any.


We created the concept of PebbleBarn because we noticed a gap in the Pebble appmosphere.  There were a few different places to download apps and watchfaces, but nothing that had a true eCommerce system where developers could charge for their work.  If a developer wanted to ask for money, it was typically through a PayPal donation button (and most developers can probably attest that donations rarely work). 


PebbleBarn was developed to give developers the option of selling their apps to other Pebblers.  While we offer both free and paid apps, the backend of our site is ultimately geared toward apps that have a price associated with them (I'll explain this a little more shortly).


At first, we skinned our knees a little bit.  As we prepared for our launch, we were really excited because the developer PocketScience added PacMan to the site, along with a few of his other amazing games.  I'm a web developer by trade (and far from an attorney), and quite frankly the thought of trademarks/copyrights didn't cross my mind until it was too late.  We received plenty of backlash from the online community, and then we received email from a NAMCO attorney just a week or so after our launch instructing us to remove PacMan from the site. PacMan had to come down, but we're still hopeful that PocketScience can remake the game so it's not infringing on any trademarks.


We also had a developer who [released apps on MyPebbleFaces that linked to our site asking for payment](http://i.imgur.com/a6YQqqi.png).  This obviously caused some Pebblers to get upset when they tried to upgrade their existing apps from MPF, only to find out their app was gone and replaced with a sentence asking to visit PebbleBarn and pay for it.  We want to make sure that anybody who downloaded the fake app receives exactly what thought they were getting initially.  We're giving away coupon codes for a free app to anybody who emails brad@pebblebarn.com by midnight tonight (June 22nd MST) and requests it.  Just include the name of the app you're requesting, and your PebbleBarn username (if you have one), and we'll respond within 24 hours with the code.  


Now let's talk a little bit more about the site.  We get a lot of inquiries about why certain things are done differently than MyPebbleFaces (which, by the way, is an amazing site that does an amazing job at displaying watchfaces/games/apps/etc and making it extremely easy for the user to download).  The most common questions are “Do I really need to create an account” and “why do I need to add a product to my cart? Can't I just download it immediately?”  


These are all good questions, because PebbleBarn certainly has a different user experience than MPF.  The reasons are based primarily on our eCommerce software.  Every user on PebbleBarn has their own personal account page that keeps track of all of their purchases and downloads.  This is particularly helpful when new versions of the apps are released, since the user can simply login to their dashboard and download the updates (all new versions are free once you buy an app).  Many people expressed the fact that even though they wanted to purchase an app, they didn't want to sign up on the site.  We totally understand this, so we've made the user accounts optional.  The only downside to this is if the user removes the app from the site, they're then required to go into their email to find the original download when they first bought the app if they want to add it again.


As far as adding *free* products to your cart, this is something we're still trying to work on, and we're open to suggestions.  Currently, in order for us to accurately track the number of downloads (which is usually an important thing for developers), all apps must go through the checkout process.  This can be a little awkward to ""checkout"" when the total value of your cart is $0, but obviously no payment details are required for this type of transaction.  You simply have to click the ""Checkout"" button once it's in your cart.  We can always add a big download button on each product page, but currently that would cause the developer loses visibility on the download count.  Some developers might care about this, others may not, but we're trying to keep each product page consistent.  Bottom line is we're still working through some of the ideas on how to best tackle free apps on the site.


For developers, PebbleBarn provides a lot of nice features.  The dashboard on a developer's page has additional options that aren't seen by customers, including a list of all products that receive commissions and a tracker that shows every single purchase ever made for a product [(see here for more)](http://i.imgur.com/y4c9U8v.png).  For devs with multiple products, everything can be filtered by product.  We pay a 70/30 commission, which is standard in most app stores, and we make payouts to the developers after every $25 in commissions received.  We're also in the early stages of creating a more robust edit page for developers who wish to update the version of the app, or change the verbiage of the description.


For what it's worth, the developer of [Pebblets](https://pebblebarn.com/shop/pebblets/) had only received $10 in donations over the course of several months when the app was offered for free.  In the first 4 days after PebbleBarn launched, he had already doubled that (the app is actually $1.99, not $2.99 as shown in the previous image).  Since then he's received his first payout and is working on the next $25.  It's not huge money, but so far it's proven to be better than just donation requests.


We've also been asked by several people if our site is sponsored or endorsed by Pebble.  The answer to this is no; however Eric Migicovsky has shown his support for PebbleBarn and our developers [in other ways](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/44914/#Comment_44914).  


I guess the bottom line is our ultimate goal is to just give developers another option for where they list their apps.  If you have an app that you think might be worth $.99 (or more) to others, we'd love for you to give us a shot.  If you have some apps that you want to list for free, we'd love to have those, too.  We know we're only as good as the developers who use our site, so the more the merrier.


Sorry this was a little longwinded, but I'd be happy to answer any questions.  You can also email me directly at brad@pebblebarn.com


tl;dr – we hit a few road bumps, but we're back in full swing and we'd love for you to check out our site.

1363068588.0	1a4uhk	Possible answers to SDK/production silence	yY33rfX	36	8	48	"*I don't often post things anywhere on the internet, let alone Reddit, but I feel compelled to lay out some of my thoughts about issues that the Pebble team has been oddly silent about. First, I just want to make it clear that* **this is 100% speculation and theory***. I have no connection with Pebble whatsoever, unless you count the black Pebble I pre-ordered on February 19, 2013.*

There are three main issues I have seen brought up repeatedly here, on the Pebble forums, and in comments on Pebble related articles:

1. The current status of the SDK
2. Production being far slower than estimated
3. The schedule/order the Pebble colors will be produced in

Considering that the Pebble team is fairly open about most parts of the company, it seems surprising that they can't provide anything but silence on these issues. It's not that people aren't being heard, because it's simply impossible to miss the sheer volume of people asking these questions everywhere the Pebble team has a presence. They have heard your questions and they know you want answers, but instead you get complete silence, even as other questions get answered quickly.

Why? Well, let's break things down a little. There are essentially two reasons why a person would not do something:

1. They can't
2. They don't want to

Let's apply that thinking to this situation.

**They can't**

Maybe they simply don't know the answer. They can't tell you what they don't know. (*Example: They don't know the order or schedule of color production because production times have been so varied, in addition to the variables introduced by each individual color*)

Maybe they are legally prohibited from talking about what you are asking for. (*Example: They can't talk about the SDK right now due to temporary non-disclosure agreements with partners or hacker backers.*)

**They don't want to**

This is the biggie: They have determined that saying nothing is better than saying something. This could well be the answer to all of the questions met with silence. Let me run through some scenarios with you:

Scenario: Bad news: They've hit some major snags on the SDK, possibly related to licensing, possibly just getting the code up to a reasonable quality. It's going to be at least X month(s) before they can even have the watchface SDK out, to say nothing of the app SDK. Production isn't nearly as fast as expected, and they have to (continue production at that factory anyway due to costs of changing factories/move to a new factory and delay things further in the hope that production can pick up). As for colors, (they can't get one or more colors to turn out right, and they need more time/they have been unable to get the right color material due to shortages or volume issues). Heck, they even underestimated the costs involved, and so things have to be slowed down to save enough money so they can survive.

* They come clean, they answer honestly and completely. Some users, true to their word, are happy just to have the communication and content to wait for a good product. Other users become irate at the continued delays, possibly to the point of selling their Pebbles and posting negatively everywhere the Pebble is mentioned. I would guess that the irate users would massively outnumber the content ones in this case. The journalists will quickly pick up this piece of news and sharpen their talons. Before long, any tech/gadget news site out there that has mentioned or reviewed the Pebble in the past will be running the story about the even further slipped ship dates, broken promises, and silence leading up to it. Most places that talked about the Pebble were positive about it because of its potential, but seeing this latest stumble they may well become negative about it. Pre-order customers may simply decide to take their business elsewhere when the Pebble name is dragged through the mud, thus destroying a large bit of their future profitability. With the Pebble as their only product, if it fails or falters their entire company could go down in flames.

* They could lie. The Pebble team could say that everything is actually going better than we think. Production and shipping numbers have been under-reported, and colors are turning out nicely. The watchface SDK is going through a last bit of polish before release, and the app SDK won't be far behind. Being that for the purposes of this scenario none of that is true, this would all be discovered as a lie in short order. If you thought telling the truth was bad, the results of this would be even more devastating. Lying in this situation is beyond stupid.

* They could remain silent. Whenever asked about this, no matter how directly, they don't even acknowledge the existence of the question. People will become frustrated with the lack of answers on these pretty important questions. Some will ask them over and over again, as if doing so will somehow compel a response. Others will post angrily wherever they frequent. However, as the Pebble team is hard at work on getting Pebbles out to backers and getting the software just right, they will eventually fulfill all of their backers' Pebbles and get the SDK out. People will be vaguely irritated that they didn't get any answers when they asked, but they will be happy with their Pebbles and the software that developers are now creating for it. Even the pre-orders will get their Pebbles, and then the Pebble enters the world of retail. With the kinks worked out and a happy userbase 100,000-ish strong even before retail availability, they become the most successful smartwatch yet created.

So, I think it's pretty easy to see that their best option is to stay silent until they are out of the woods. Telling the truth too early or lying could easily destroy everything they've worked for up to this point, assuming they are having any difficulties. Then you would have a smartwatch without a company supporting it with software updates, and possibly without an SDK to make things with either. That doesn't help anybody. Just cut them some slack and be patient for a while longer. They have a pretty good track record of answering questions and helping people, their silence here is obviously not malicious in nature.

tl;dr Silence on these questions is the best option for their business right now. It's also the best thing for Pebble owners, considering possible repercussions."	t5_2txls	True

](http://i.imgur.com/n5JJQal.jpg)
A little over a week ago I left for a trip to Florida. I first flew down and didn't have any trouble getting through security with my Pebble. I wasn't required to take it off during the body scan (although the TSA agent asked for a quick look after I walked though). No problems while it was in the air either. I spent 7 days in Florida and the temperature was 80-90 and sunny most of the time. I didn't experience any discomfort wearing my pebble with the regular strap (I wear my Pebble fairly loose though). 5 of those days I went to the beach and never had any problem swimming in the saltwater or digging for shells in the sand. One problem I did find that's not totally related to the Pebble itself is that when applying spray on sunscreen the sunscreen stuck to my gadgetwrap skin and I haven't been able to clean it (it's only noticeable at certain angles. [Here you can see the specks.](http://i.imgur.com/DfaUqfw.jpg)) Over all my Pebble spent a lot of time in the hot sun and underwater in fresh and saltwater (saltwater mostly). I also charged it once during the trip. The hot sun didn't seem to affect battery life. One last thing I did notice was that I purchased a cheap pair of sunglasses that had some kind of filter on them (I don't know what it was) but it enhanced the LCD discoloration 10x anything I've seen before to the point where I couldn't read my Pebble. ([this picture was taken looking through them in my room light, in full sunlight it was maybe twice this bad.](http://i.imgur.com/v32XGTD.jpg)) 

All in all I'm very happy how my Pebble did over my trip, it's working just as it did before the trip. I was worried about salt and sand but can say they didn't have any affect on my Pebble. Hope this helps alleviate any concerns with some people. 

Also, if you have any ideas on how to clean a Gadget Wrap I would be grateful."	t5_2txls	True

1364851486.0	1bghpj	Pebble should have hired a Product Manager, somewhere around 10 months ago	thedept	50	24	9	"A common misstep by small tech companies, particularly ones who see sudden surges of success (say, Pebble) is that the founder/entrepreneur/CEO tries to hold onto his/her vision and see it through to the end.

When things are still small and before success comes, that's fair. There's not much money and things are all bootstrappy, if you will. What few people you have on staff are all pulling double or triple duty, and your CEO is heavily involved in the technology aspects of things.

But then success comes, if you're lucky, and the demands on the CEO starts to change. The CEO might resist it, because they're a great engineer at heart, but the press and the general public start expecting things (take away Pebble's Kickstarter updates, which are unusual for any company). It's hard to distance yourself from this thing you dreamed up in the shower or sitting on a barstool and are now on the verge of making a reality. So, you try to juggle the demands: spend as much time as you can getting your new product to market, let the new stuff fester. Eventually, you're doing a lot of things halfway decently, instead of doing incredibly well the few things you used to do or now need to do.

A savvy CEO recognizes this drain and hires a Product Manager to deliver the end product, but it's hard to be objective and see this, because all you want to do is see it through to the end. But eventually the CEO of a successful company who spends too much time involved in granular detail detracts from the long-term success of their company.

The CEO will always wear multiple hats, but the difference is that when the company is small, these are things like lead engineer, programmer or designer, but when a company sees some big wins and starts getting lots of press the need for the CEO becomes sales, marketing, PR and the like.

I'm not saying a Product Manager would have had Pebble in all of our hands last September or would have fixed the color temperature issues, but I think it could have alleviated a tremendous burden off Eric's back and let him focus on being the face of Pebble, something he's historically been good at.

(I should add that this is not a criticism of Eric, because there's plenty of that going around and I'm not trying to pile on. All I'm trying to show is show what might have been and could still be, and get us out of this ""darkest timeline"" that we seem to be in.)"	t5_2txls	True

1363394294.0	1adtr1	"Bug: Firmware upgrades are broken in last night's beta release 
"	erOhead	27	4	13	"Hey there, pebble-users.

Last night we published a bad version of PebbleOS v1.9.0
(normal_ev2_4_v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e.pbz) through our beta release
channel. This release contains a bug that breaks the data-transfer
protocol used to update the watch's firmware. Any users that are
running last night's beta release must reboot their Pebble into
""Recovery Mode"" before upgrading from the beta release of PebbleOS
v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e.

## How do I know if I'm running the affected firmware?

Navigate to the ""About"" screen (Settings &gt; About) and take note of the
displayed firmware version number. If your watch is running
'v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e', you're running the affected firmware. The
bug only affects this particular version of the firmware, if you're
running any other version of the firmware (as of March 15, 2013) you
are not affected.

## Updating Your Watch Via Recovery Mode

You can update your watch from Recovery Mode by performing the
following steps:

1. Press and hold the Back, Up, and Select buttons until the watch
reboots and a ""Loading..."" message is displayed. This will take
approximately 15 seconds; if you let go of any button you will need to
start the process over.
2. Entering Recovery Mode will cause your Pebble to forget any
previously paired devices, so you must instruct your handset to
un-pair/forget your Pebble before attempting to re-pair with your
Pebble.
3. Once you have re-paired your Pebble to your phone, launch the
Pebble app on your phone. The app should detect that an update is
available and prompt you to upgrade to v1.8.1. If your app does not
detect the v1.8.1 update, its cache of update information is probably
out of date. You can clear this cache by killing the app and
re-lauching it.
4. (Optional) There is a bug in the Recovery Firmware versions under
v1.5 that prevents the Pebble from restarting after the update has
succeeded. Once your handset displays an 'Update Complete' message,
you'll need to manually reset your watch by pressing-and-holding the
Select button until the ""Pebble"" logo appears on the display. It is
very important that you let go of the Select button as soon as the
Pebble logo appears, otherwise you may trigger another reboot into
Recovery Mode, requiring you to restart the update process!

I put a small drop over each scratch and rubbed for about 20 seconds with a soft cotton cloth. Like magic, the scratches were completely removed.

I was worried that the abrasive might remove the glossy finish or mar it in some way but it had no effect. The ""crystal"" was just a glossy and clear as before but without the scratches. I was amazed I have to say.

At that point I put on a clear Skinomi protector (which has a flaw in it if you can believe my luck) but I'm not worried about that.

I started, thinking that this will have a very limited use-case, but it turned out to be a lot of fun and for the past weeks I've been discovering all the awesomeness Wolframalpha is capable of.  

Long story short: I created a tasker profile/task that will answer your questions. The input is your voice, the source is Wolframalpha and the output is a notification on your wrist:  

I've made a short video highlighting 3 possible questions and 2 errors that occur either if you ask something that Wolframalpha can't answer or if you don't answer fast enough. The ""hotword"" I use in this example is ""search"". You can use every hotword you like, but I'll get to that later in the tinkering process:  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjn5iL0Y5lI I apologize for the quality...  
If you've never heard of Wolframalpha or want to know what else it is capable of, check [this out.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/)  

**Setup:**  
What you will need:  

* [Wolfram ID](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signup.html) You need to register as a developer to do this.  The APP-ID you will receive looks like this XXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX

* [Tasker ($2.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)  

* [Autovoice ($1.57)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autovoice.unlock)| To get familiar with AutoVoice, feel free to watch [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J259WzkO3-Y)  

* [Pebble Notifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin) 
 
* [Pebble Tasker (optional) ($1.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodek.pebbletasker)  

* [Tasker Profile](http://torron.net/pebble/profile.prf.xml)| [QR Code](http://i.imgur.com/UysR4Il.png)  
Steps:  
 
*!Follow steps 1-13 below if you didn't download using the qr code!*  

1. Install all the apps. 
2. Download the profile.  
3. Navigate to the profile with your favorite file browser. I use [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop)  
4. Open the file with Tasker.  
5. Open Tasker and once the profile tab is selected click it again and then select Import and finally select the profile to import.
6. In Tasker click on the profile you just imported. Then click on ""GetResults""
7. Now go to 4. ""HTTP Get""
8. Under ""Path"" add the Wolfram ID you got from developer.wolframalpha.com right after &amp;appid=
9. Finally we need to make AutoVoice listen to what we say. To do this we create a task that launches continuous voice:
10. Create a new task  
11. Add an action. Go to Plugin-&gt;AutoVoiceContinuous  
12. Under Configuration click Edit and check the box.  
13. All that's left now is to launch the task we just created and then talk to your phone. I use PebbleTasker for this, but you don't need to.  

*!Follow steps 1-12 below if you downloaded using the qr code!* 

1. Install all the apps. 
2. Download the profile.  
3. Open the file with Tasker.  
4. Open Tasker and once the profile tab is selected click it again and then select Import and then select the profile to import.  
5. In Tasker click on the profile you just imported. Then click on ""GetResults""  
6. Now go to 4. ""HTTP Get""  
7. Under ""Path"" add the Wolfram ID you got from developer.wolframalpha.com right after &amp;appid=  
8. Finally we need to make AutoVoice listen to what we say. To do this we create a task that launches continuous voice:  
9. Create a new task  
10. Add an action. Go to Plugin-&gt;AutoVoiceContinuous  
11. Under Configuration click Edit and check the box.  
12. All that's left now is to launch the task we just created and then talk to your phone. I use PebbleTasker for this, but you don't need to.  

**Remember: If you set the pebble app to only forward notifications when the screen is off, you'll need to have your screen off for this as well.**

**Tinkering**  

Feel free to tinker with all the settings and add/remove as much functionality as you want.  
To change the hotword I was talking about earlier, click on the profile context in the tasker app. Then click on Edit, and finally click Command Filter.  
I decided to use:  

* ""search"" which worked best for me to be honest  

* ""I'm wondering"" For this one I was trying to create a seemless hotword: I imagined a dinner conversation at which a controversial topic is discussed and people seem to know different facts. Just as everyone is pulling their phones out to be able to google said fact, you say to your phone: ""I'm wondering how many calories are there in 500 grams of bacon"" Before anyone has a chance to find an answer your wrist buzzes and (quietly) reveals to you that there are 2668 calories in 500g of bacon!  

* ""OK pebble"" obligatory  

* ""okay pebble""  

**Limitations**  

* The continuous AV is still in beta and can eventually stop your microphone from working. A reboot fixes that problem.  

* One pebble notification is limited to 160 characters. I tried pushing a second notification, but that made the ""GetResults"" task twice as long as it is now, and caused a lot of delays.

* A free WolframAlpha developer account is limited to 2000 queries a month. This doesn't sound like a lot, but it does leave you with 66 queries a day. After testing this for a 2-3 weeks I am at around 355 queries total, so you should be good to go.

Apart form that, have fun using this :D

I'm a kickstarter backer with an orange one ordered. Just got some genuine questions.

Communication.
I'm wondering why there are not more updates on the project. I know so little about this project as a whole I'm left feeling as if I'm not part of the Pebble journey. It's a real shame. I'd bet if Eric had gotten funding from business investors, not crowd funding, he would of had to have given them many more details on what is going on. Personally, I don't see why we are any different, Pebble wouldn't of been made without either. It's not hard to take maybe 10 things that have been worked on in the last week and bang out an update. Anyway, I realise I'm covering old ground with this....so not much point, clearly falls on deaf ears.

The SDK.
I just saw in another post here (about the twitter thread being closed on the forum) Eric referred to the SDK as the Watchface SDK being the deliverable. People have interjected saying this is only a version of the SDK leading up to the full release of the SDK. I only see this as opinion, is there official word on this. Nearly the entire reason for me backing is I'm a computing student and saw this as an opportunity to keep with an emerging market and do some coding on a new platform. While I will enjoy owning a Pebble, it will lose a massive amount of value to me if a full SDK is never made available. I'm not concerned with timeframe, just honesty as to what I'll get in the end. ** This has been answered, thank you for pointing me in the right direction RichardGG**

Production.
Again, old ground but why can't Pebble just say ""We're producing the colours in this order guys"". Again, Still not fussed about timeframe I'd just like even a little idea where I am. If Orange is last, fine, at least I know. It comes back to my first point. I think, as an investor, I should be privy to production order at least. I'm not bothered you can play Snake on it....


These are not a personal attack on anyone. I'm just finally getting frustrated with what I think are simple things, not being considered. Even a meaningful update would be nice. I'm no bothered there is a Mario watchface, what's the true turn around time on a line when swapping colour to colour? What's the order of production? Those kinds of things. You know the answers guys. Just let us know.

If anyone has actual answers to any of my questions, not just hearsay or opinion, I'd appreciate being directed to them.

Thanks.

It would be helpful for us to know as we consider expanding to more colors in the future.

&gt; How'd we do in narrowing down the final 12? Which colors are you rooting for? After submitting your input on the voting site, let us know what you think here on /r/Pebble. Thanks again to the mods for helping us set this post up :)

(Sepluvsepluv, once I figure out a good shade of Fox Orange, I'll post it up.)


Since we've got a special place in our hearts at Pebble HQ for Redditors, [here's the live-updating Dropbox for all the mockups thus far](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6t31fzq62nf98z7/IKt-bqxBh8), organized by color family.


The Dropbox makes for cleaner viewing than [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/getpebble/colormypebble/), plus you get to see new ones go up as soon as they're done, before posting to Pinterest or anywhere else.


Consider this self-post as an ongoing thread. We'll be fulfilling #ColorMyPebble requests as much as we can, in addition to regularly checking in and answering any other Pebble-related questions as best we can.


In the meantime ladies and germs, thanks again for supporting Pebble in a million different ways. Send me color requests, share your feedback, ask questions, it's all good in the 'hood. Looking forward to it.

---

**First Off:** BestBuy.com sucks. The website stock is almost never accurate. If there is at least 1 item in the RSS (will get to that later) system the website will show that it is in stock. Even if the item was bought at 10:00am when the store opens. The site checks once a night and updates it's stock.

---

**Second:** There is a internal system that *all* employees can check. It's called **RSS**. This is the tool that updates roughly every 4 to 6 hours. Using this system will allow the employee to see all major stores in the area stock in one spot. This system uses the SKU number that is assigned to each item that Best Buy sales. From gift cards to 80"" Sharps TV's. 

This tool also shows **IF** the SKU you looked up may have some items being shipped to that store. Note' it can check other stores. It is not always accurate but can help you choose where to look next on the next shipment. 

---

**Third:** The store I worked at got it's shipments every Wednesday and Saturday. All stores are different and you should be able to check with a employee to see when the trucks come in. That is your best time to go in, 10:00am on the truck day. 

---

**Last:** I will provide the SKU number for the Black and Red pebbles below. I would suggest calling your local Best Buy and asking the phone person to do a RSS Search on a specific SKU and ask if they or any nearby stores have the item in stock. If they don't ask them if there is a possible shipment on the way and an ETA.

Be careful with spray-on sunscreen!	travipross	26	4	11	"The other day, I sprayed on some sunscreen without considering the implications it would have on my watch. Waterproof, spray-on sunscreen is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to remove. With plastics, it is especially difficult, as it typically requires a solvent to remove, and that would likely cause damage beyond that of the sunscreen alone.

Since then, I have opened several tickets and received very little support except that I will ""just have to wait"" and ""I'll have someone in contact with you by the end of the day"", which never happens. This is almost a month after the original shipment, and several weeks after they have received it back in Oakland according to the tracking number. Does anyone have an alternative route of support? I'm about ready to just get a refund and forget the watch altogether.

EDIT: Emailed today stating that if I didn't get a response, I would just take a refund. No response from support, so no pebble for me. It's very sad to see a company with so much potential miss the most important business aspect: your customers always come first. "	t5_2txls	True
1372863620.0	1hkixx	My Pebble watch arrived broken over 8 weeks ago, and still hasn't been resolved.	cdutson	25	7	22	"Quick story:

I backed the Kickstarter project for the Pebble Watch.

After waiting, and waiting, _and waiting_ for my watch to show up, it ended up at my door mid May (though I had to pay customs to get it). I eagerly opened the box, took it out, got it started, and noticed the back light would not work. I tried everything possible, checked the support docs, and eventually contacted support through the app (May 14th), and after 3 days (May 17th), was asked to provide video proof (which I'm pretty sure isn't my responsibility, but whatever), which I did (May 21st was my first opportunity) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOUQn8wfMV8. 

My ticket was then looked at, and I was told I would qualify for an RMA. I asked about an ETA for the RMA releases, and was met with silence.

On May 24th, I pestered them for some sort of response, to which I was told my RMA had been added, and I'd be told when the watch was being sent. 

And then I waited **4 weeks.**

Now, I'm moving out of the country at the end of July, and I had to pester them again about the ETA on when the RMAs would be sent out (via email to no avail, and twitter to which they eventually responded June 18th). Still silence. I followed that up with another email detailing my concerns given I was moving. They eventually got back to me stating that I should probably provide Pebble with a new address, meaning the RMAs were at _least_ 6 more weeks away. I provided the new address, and asked for an ETA.

They updated the address, and refused to give me an ETA. Every time I've asked about when I will actually get my watch, I am met with utter silence.

It's gotten to the point now that even when I get the watch, I'm so upset at the way this whole thing has been handled that I'm unsure I even want it any more. I mean, it's July now, and I've **waited over 7 weeks**, and still have no idea if or when my watch is going to show up.

I can't believe how badly they've opted to treat a backer of their product. It's depressing.

**TL;DR: Pebble sent me a broken watch, said they'd mail a replacement, and haven't said anything since, leaving me with a broken watch.**

**EDIT as of July 8th:** Pebble have gotten in contact with me since posting this thread (July 5th), and are investigating. I asked about compensation, to which swag was offered. I have declined the swag as I'm not comfortable advertising for them at this point. They now have my new shipping address, but have yet to tell me when the RMA is going to be shipped.

As of yet, my case remains open.

**EDIT as of July 9th:** Pebble have apparently shipped a new watch to my Canadian address (as I requested). I will report back when it arrives. I won't be able to check to see if it's in working order until August 2nd, when I land."	t5_2txls	True

When the ""switch to a black Pebble"" email arrived I immediately switched. I would much rather have had grey but I didn't want to wait another couple of months. 

So it shipped earlier this week and was delivered today. To a wrong address. In another zip code.

I checked my account and I definitely had the correctly address down. USPS is of virtually no help. Even though it shipped First Class with a tracking number, they can't tell me what exact address they left it at. Supposedly they'll call me on Monday but I have a feeling I'm just out of a watch here. 

UPDATE: So good news. I called the post office this morning and spoke directly to the route driver. He didn't remember delivering any packages to my work address yesterday. He put me on hold for about 15 minutes while he searched for it. And thankfully, he found it. He had it held for me at the front desk and I picked it up this morning.

Apparently, since I had it shipped to my work address, they hold everything there at the office for another day, but mark things as having been ""delivered"". Didn't really make sense to me. Even stranger, he couldn't explain why the delivered zip code showed as something different than my work address zip code. It didn't even match the post office zip code which is one number different.

The only downside is that I didn't receive my large strap, and I'm a pretty decent sized guy. The regular strap doesn't really fit. Guess I'll be looking at third party."	t5_2txls	True

I like to draw peoples attention to five a few great watch faces in hopes that someone may develop them. 
 
In order... 
 
[LinesWatch](http://mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=295&amp;aName=Elzor&amp;pageTitle=LinesWatch&amp;auID=6) - If this was built, it would most likely be my default watch face. It makes such good use of the display. Clean and simple. 
 
[MazeClock](http://mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=286&amp;aName=Elzor&amp;pageTitle=MazeClock&amp;auID=6) - More as a concept piece, this would be a great face to show off to friends what the watch can do. 
 
[Simple](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=51&amp;aName=Fr0zone&amp;pageTitle=Simple&amp;auID=1) - If you hover over this you get an inverted image. It's this white on black design that I would like. As the title says, it's simple with a lot of information. 
 
[Ziiiro Gravity](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=298&amp;aName=8a22a&amp;pageTitle=Ziiiro+Gravity&amp;auID=25) - A clean well designed watch face. More nice to look at than anything. Cool nonetheless. 
 
[Mixed Time](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=120&amp;aName=Slruh&amp;pageTitle=Mixed+Time&amp;auID=1) - Good use of negative space, big hour makes it easy to read at a glance.

It's an exciting week for us all, with the SDK arriving, which means that we will be seeing tons of different watchfaces and apps! 

So this got me thinking. If you are deep in a menu, say checking scores for something, or even toggling bluetooth, the back button could be pressed and held to go back rapidly through menus (instead of having to push the back button a bunch of times).

This is just a suggestion that would make the flow of Pebble better (in my eyes), and I think it could really come in handy when we see the SDK this week.

I hope there's a firmware update in the pipeline with Pebble now being able to concentrate on working on a better experience on the software side.

What's still missing for me:

* Volume controls on the music app; I don't know why it's so hard to integrate and it was already shown in a ui video. The music app doesn't make use of longer button presses so there's an option
* Stock timer &amp; stopwatch app; I know there are user made apps (which are great btw.) for these functions but unfortunately the occupy a watchface slot
* Option for watchfaces to save settings on the watch or ios/android app; It could be used for saving things like seconds hand yes/no, inverted yes/no, european date yes/no etc.
* Usage of accelerometer &amp; magnetometer; Why is it build in if it's not used for a compass app or something similar
* Better &amp; more complete ios app; Right now the app is pretty much useless; caller id won't work for me; the new email option worked once, now I'm back to the more reliable - although sometimes short lived reliability - finger dance; things like httpebble should be intergrated...

Pebble has finally started offering replacement charging cables, but they quickly sold out (and are still sold out).

I found some off-brand Pebble charging cables on E-Bay and decided to give it a shot. I still have my original charging cable, and I did this mainly out of curiosity and to know what options I had if I *did* lose my cable. 

So here are the results:

- I payed $19.99 (the ""Buy Now"" price) with free shipping. The Pebble replacement cables will be $10 with shipping, once they have some in stock.

- It took 5 days to get the cable (not business days, just 5 days total).

- The cable has worked perfectly so-far, and has charged the Pebble without any issues.

- I can tell no difference in the magnetic strength of the charger heads (the part that adheres to the Pebble).

- You may be able to tell in the picture that there is a tiny difference in shape of the heads of the two cables. The non-brand cable does not fit as perfectly snug as the original pebble cable. This does not mean it is hard to get on or that it comes off, just that there is a tiny bit more wiggle room when it is plugged in.

- Other than that, the only other difference I can tell is that the non-brand cable is slightly stiffer than the Pebble cable, probably due to a difference in the thickness in the plastic sheath.

Final Verdict: 

If you need a charging cable now and don't want to wait until Pebble get's more in stock, this seems to be a perfectly viable option."	t5_2txls	True

This isn't a complaint post, I just want to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me. I originally ordered an orange pebble (26/04/12 if that makes any difference), and after the kickstarter update sent out on 09/04/13, changed my colour preference to black on the same day. Since then I've had no communication, and my account.pebble page is still on ""Processing Shipment"".

Is anyone else in the same situation? 2 weeks (the promised shipping deadline for switchers) would have been 23/04/13, so we are by no means long after that, but I'm wondering if I'm the only one."	t5_2txls	True

Still, there are persistent questions about the durability of the Pebble's plastic face, and in lieu of answers from the--admittedly swamped--Pebble staff, it might be helpful to collect some input from the community.

Personally I was willing to roll the dice regarding screen scratches on my Pebble, but then came numerous reports of scuffs at the slightest brush.  Coupled with that deep Skinomi discount from awhile back, I went ahead and picked up a clear protector that happened to arrive the same day as my Pebble.  I therefore have never worn my Pebble without it.

The protector is great: no discernible ""orange peel"" effect, and so far it's defended the face from a large wood splinter and a glancing blow to a door jamb.  It is a millimeter or so smaller than the actual face on all edges, but I don't see that as a negative since it seems less likely to peel away by accident.  From anything but a few inches away, it simply looks like a stock Pebble from the factory floor.  That door jamb incident did actually pull one corner of the protector off temporarily, and I'm happy to report that a little more installation solution immediately stuck it back in place with no adverse effects.  I got a few bubbles that appeared a few hours after the initial installation that took a good 5 days to disappear completely, so FYI.  If I have cause to test the waterproofing of the Skinomi protector, I'll certainly report back.

But I'm wondering if the folks who are *without* a protector want to weigh in.  I know that scratches are happening, despite early Team Pebble claims that the plastic was ""scratch resistant.""  Have those scratches remained?  Have you buffed them with toothpaste or some other polish?  Or, as I am quite curious about, **have they disappeared on their own?**  I have owned numerous plastic-faced watches over the years, and it seems that most of them are made from a plastic that tends to be not scratch-resistant, but rather, self-healing.  That is to say, the plastic has a certain malleable quality that removes blemishes over the course of normal wear.

If that is the case, I would probably not reapply a protector.  I stopped using them on my phones years ago because I started to get the feeling that I was simply *preserving* my tech instead of using it [conforming to the device instead of the other way around, you know?].  But that move was aided by increasingly tough glass screens, and if the Pebble really does scratch--and stay scratched--as easily as it seems, then that's a whole other matter.

Of course, if any Team Pebble redditors wish to chime in with specifics about screen coatings, the definition of ""scratch-resistant,"" etc, by all means, feel free."	t5_2txls	True

1361914862.0	19a82x	First charge cycle complete. Here's what I think. (spoiler: I'm quite happy with my new friend)	Vlemert	23	7	16	"[Check my g+ album here!](https://plus.google.com/photos/102824102306658407395/albums/5849365809067625937)

**Let's first get the dates out of the way, before people start asking:**
Black pebble, from the Netherlands, I backed on 13/04. Got my shipping address confirmation on the first of february. Saw on [ispebbleshipping](http://ispebbleshipping.com) that a new batch was sent out the 13th of february. Checked my account, mine was sent too. Never got a tracking email, ~~no clue which shipper~~ PostNL dropped it off at my doorstep, it arrived the 21st of february.

**Package:**
The watch arrived in the package we've all seen before. Seemed secure, nothing strange. But: as soon as I got my pebble out of the box and wanted to put it on I noticed something strange. Turned out the clasp was assembled upside down, and I couldn't put the watch on as-is. Check the google+ album to see what I mean. The entire thing was not really a problem as my alternative watchband arrived the same day, and I switched it out.

**Platform:**
I'm on an old galaxy s I9000. It's currently running cyanogenmod 10.1 (android 4.2.1).

**Connecting:**
As soon as the pebble arrived, I installed the android app. Had a bit of a hassle getting it connected (turns out I still can't read instructions). After manually pairing it via bluetooth settings and enabling pebble in accessibility it suddenly started working.

I also installed [Pebble Notifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kYXR0YXNtb29uLnBlYmJsZS5wbHVnaW4iXQ..) to be able to send any notification to the watch. App is doing a pretty good job at that too.

**Hardware:**
Pebble is not the most beautiful watch I've ever seen, but given it's purpose it doen't need to be. Hell it could have been a lot uglier, so I'm pretty happy about that. But as others have stated before, it's not that tough. The watchface tends to scrats pretty easily, I've been extremely careful over the last 5 days and already have some microscratches on the surface (almost invisible, so no problem yet). I will be putting on a screen protector I bought from [bestskinsever](http://www.bestskinsever.com/) later this week to see how that goes.

**Screen:**
I really like the screen. In good lighting conditions it's very easy to read. The 'flick your wrist to turn on the backlight' trick is very nice in the dark. Tapping the watch to turn on the light hardly works, but I'd never use it anyway. When viewed at extreme angles (again, see g+ album) oily smudges appear. I think it's just something every pebble has (seen others post this) so I'm not too worried. I tend to see it a lot as I'm often sitting in the dark, with one light source in front of me (pc screen). Flicking the wrist and looking directly at the watch solves the problem entirely.

**Battery life:**
I've only gone through one cycle (charged &gt; empty) so I don't know what it'll do in a few weeks, but I'm very happy about it. Even though it only lasted 4 days (instead of advertised 7). This is mainly because I've been a very heavy user, showing it off to people, switching watchfaces multiple times a day (still can't choose). And I think the ton of notifications from whatsapp group chats don't help either. Overall, not too shabby. (I do avoid watchfaces that update by the second, don't trust 'em)

**Watch band:**
I suspected I would dislike the default rubber bands quite a lot, so I ordered [something else](http://www.ebay.com/itm/18-22mm-Black-Solid-Stainless-Steel-Band-Bracelet-Watch-Strap-Deployment-Buckle-/290775968901?ssPageName=ADME:X:AAQ:US:1123) in advance. Someone else posted it on reddit earlier and I really liked the look. I ordered it on feb 12th, and it arrived the same day as my pebble (what a coincidence!). I think it matches great, and I was right about the rubber bands (personal taste, wouldn't want them putting on something expensive I'd dislike too, so a cheap rubber band is actually perfect)

**Effects of owning a pebble:**
Having my phone out of my pocket is becoming less and less important. In the old days, my phone would vibrate (or make some kind of noise) and I'd *have* to take it out to see what's up. Now my watch vibrates, I casually glance at it, and quickly decide if it's important or not. Already getting close to the point that I don't have a clue where my phone is. (other than within bluetooth range ofcourse).

**Verdict (so far):**
I'm really happy I backed this project back in april. You can't make a gadget freak happier than this. I hope to see the firmware updated sometime soon, and ofcourse the infamous SDK (no pressure, I know it's being worked on :D (ok maybe just a little bit of pressure)). Those two points can really make pebble's promises come true.

**Update 27-02:**

*Pictures!*)
Added some more pictures to the album, so you can see the band a little better (I hope).

*Taxes*)
As I said in the comments, I didn't have to pay taxes. But me and my friends are frequent dealextreme shoppers, and every once in a while someone gets burned, so it could happen to pebblers too I guess.

*Watch band*)
The watch band is of pretty good quality, I really like it. You are right it does make the watch a bit heavier, but it cant really bother me.
There was only one problem and that was that I couldn't get one of the screws out. I have pretty small wrists and wanted to take out the four optional shackles. Had to settle with taking out three. You can move the band up one hole in the clip thingy ([you can see this here](https://plus.google.com/photos/102824102306658407395/albums/5849365809067625937/5849683767668342354)), which makes it about half a shackle shorter. That makes 3 1/2 and turned out to be pretty good for me.

*Android app update*)
The app got updated! Music control has been improved a lot, and notifications can be disabled when the screen is on.

1364001097.0	1au1tu	"Yay, my 2-pack arrived in Brazil! (or ""How I was ripped off by the brazilian customs office"")"	botinnus	22	5	5	"Hello!

So, finally today I was able to get my 2-pack in the post office. Since it was taxed at customs, you have to go pick it up in the nearest post office and pay the import tax. So far so good, I expected it to be taxed (and it was the ""right"" thing).

So, we have a 60% import tax here. Not pretty, but it's the law. So, the value of my package as printed in the invoice in the box was 2x90 + 5 = $185 US Dollars. 60% of that should be $110, which equals ~R$230 in local currency. Hefty sum, but again, around what I was expecting.

What wasn't my surprise when the post office guy informed me that it was charged for R$297! I then looked at the customs office invoice and lo and behold, the authority over there thought Pebble were a bunch of liars and $185 was too low for what they saw at the x-ray, so he decided to say that the ""real"" price (used as base for the tax calculations) was 195 EUROS. Yes, that's right, EUROS, which amount to around 25% more than a dollar. That plus the $10 difference added R$70 to my tax, or around 30% more of what it should have been.

Now, you'd say ""you should just complain about that!"". Well, we do have a means for that. You can fill a complaint form, contesting the value and attach extra proof that the value of the product is wrong. But there are some big catches with that:
1) You have to have extra proof. I had little in that sense except for my credit card bill from a year ago, which was in the name of Kickstarter. Not really something they'd buy on. Also, the real pledge was $235, so the final value would be more or less the same thing anyway.
2) You cannot get your package while they are processing the complaint. And they take LONG. Something like months usually.
3) While they are processing your request, they keep your package, and there's a time limit that they will do it for free. So, even if your package is hold due to disputes, they will still charge you for keeping it in custody.
4) We don't really trust the post office enough to let valuable stuff like the pebble to rot there, even more so after it leaves tracking. It's not too uncommon for stuff to just disappear. I'm happy enough that the pebbles got to my local post office in the first place.

So yeah, I didn't really have much of an option. I'm still pissed off though, and thought I'd share the experience here so other brazilian backers and the Pebble team know about it. For reference, a friend of mine got a single Pebble and was taxed on about R$110, which is more correct. Mine just seems to have been inspected by someone in a really bad mood who wanted to screw me over, sadly.

Here are some pics of the Pebble box invoice and what the customs office thought about it.

(Note: the following are my personal beliefs and opinions, and other people may have different opinions.)

In no particular order:

* I got the black on black cookoo.  While it looks very cool, it's hard to read.  I suppose that's my fault.  :)

* It's a large watch.  Not everyone will like the size.

* Keep in mind that this watch is really two things: a plain, old-school, old-style analog watch, and a bluetooth transceiver connected to buttons, a beeper, a vibrator, and some indicators.

* Being an old-school analog watch, there is no way to automatically set the time.  You have to do it old-school style.  (Not that there's anything wrong with the old-school style, but this isn't something that users probably expect to find in an high-tech watch.  And, yes, I was fully aware of this limitation when I backed cookoo.  It's just that this is probably not something that most users would expect in an high-tech watch.)

* At the moment, functionality is modest. Notifications include: incoming call, missed call. Facebook post, Facebook message, calendar reminder, and low (iPhone) battery alarms.  However, I've yet to figure out how to get the calendar reminder to work.  The initial firmware has missing functionality, but I've had the calendar indicator activate multiple times.  I can't figure out how it activates, though.  Once, I it seemed to activate when a countdown timer hit zero (in the standard clock app); however, timer notifications are supposedly unimplemented (in the initial firmware), and I've been unable to make it work.  I've also experienced unexpected disconnects, inability to reconnect, and other issues (however, see next item).

* Note: a new version of the app has supposedly been submitted to the Apple store, and so it should be available, soon.  This version supposedly has better stability, better connections, alarm/timer indications, and music control.  I hope so, I feel the initial release leaves a lot to be desired, and the Apple store reviews of the initial release aren't exactly overwhelmingly positive.

* I don't know how well FB notifications work, as I don't really use FB.

* Going ""out of range"" does cause the phone to beep/vibrate multiple times (and this is the only situation -- that I've found -- where the phone seems to beep/vibrate multiple times).  If you stay out of range long enough, the iPhone also makes an old-style ""cookoo"" sound (and it appears to make this sound even if the mute switch on the side of the phone is enabled -- I've only tried this once, though).

* The cookoo has a ""command"" button (lower-right button) that can do one of three different things, depending upon a short, medium, or long button press: FB checkin, find phone (make phone beep), or drop map pin.  You can choose which of these three things happen for each of the button press types.  You cannot configure any other actions.

* The ""make phone beep"" seems useful, and does work.

* The ""drop map pin"" does work, but the pins are generally viewable only within the app.  It appears that you can somehow share a rectangular region on the map to Facebook, but that's not something I'm comfortable doing.  I wish there was a way to export the pin locations in some other other useful form.

* The app has a ""camera"" tab/button, which isn't documented.  It turns out that, in this mode, you can press a button on the watch to take a picture.  While this might seem useful for remote camera operation, you must tap a button on the iPhone to ""confirm"" the picture, or it doesn't seem to be saved; pressing the button again seems to throw away the old snapshot and take a new one.

* The audio alert (like a peep) is quiet and short - around .1-.2 sec

* Vibrations seem to be short, too (0.2 sec?) and tend to occur just once.  I think they're very difficult to feel, and there's no way I'd feel them if I was moving around or in a car.  I think I'd have to be trying to wait and feel for them, or I'd miss them.

* Alerts generally peep and vibrate (once). However, because the audio and vibration are so short and week, I miss almost all of them.

Bottom line: while I like the look and styling, even though I think this watch is hugely thick, I'm not that impressed.  Even with the new app release, I don't think I'll like this watch -- I'll just miss most alerts because I won't hear/feel them.

I'm guessing that I'll like the pebble a lot more, even though it doesn't have any kind of audible alert (and IFTTT support is pretty awesome, too).  However, this will depend upon the vibrating alert to be ""feelable"".  Does anyone know how strong the pebble's vibrator is, or how long it vibrates?

TL;DR: I don't think pebble has anything to worry about from the cookoo.

Under the pledge amount in parentheses in the date you backed the Pebble

2.  http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android/#chart-daily  
The backer per day chart (lime green bars) has dates on the x-axis and backers on the y-axis. Simply find the date you backed and add the numbers on the bars to the left of your pledge date.

The Pebble folks have indicated they can crank these bad boys out at a rate of 15,000 per week. Throw in a few days for processing and shipping and you will have an approximate date to expect your order. 

Edit: I just realized that backers could order more than one watch at a time. If you want slightly more accurate results add up the dollar amount from the chart with the blue bars and divide by $115. Even though the prices for multiple watches were lower this should give you a better idea of how many watches have to be made and delivered before yours.  "	t5_2txls	True

I've recently updated the website and wanted to give you an update as to why and what to expect.

The scope of the site has grown so much since the original so to accommodate this I had to re-write a lot of how the site handles new uploads etc and this would give me a chance to tweak the layout to try make it easier to browse and search.

It is easier for me to add new tags, languages etc for you guys to filter, there is now an API that I'm working on with another developer to bring you a native iOS app which will be a lot quicker than the current web app (If there is an Android developer out there that's interested in working on an equivalent app drop me a message).

From the feedback here a few things that have been reported 

* finding the search option - You can find this by tapping the search button as I thought it would de-clutter the main view but if you prefer it at the top like on the old site I can go back to that

* auto loading - Again I thought this would improve scrolling down a list but I can go back to the old way

* Grid view - one of the main comments regarding the old site was  increase the amount of watches to browse through them quicker which is why I opted for a grid view rather than the long vertical list, also to make it more obvious if there were different versions available.

I'll admit that my strongest point isn't design and I'm more of a coder so any ideas on improving the usability and look of the site is seriously appreciated. 

Sorry for any confusion and the issues with Android devices not installing correctly."	t5_2txls	True
1376356279.0	1k8wj4	German pebblers could use a little love	esaller	22	5	6	"**I am aware of the following official response from May 30, 2013.**
&gt; Shipments to Germany
&gt; First, our apologies it has taken so long to get Pebbles to some of you. We are in touch with the German regulatory agencies and customs officials to confirm the steps required to ensure delivery of Pebbles in Germany.
&gt; Until we have final resolution with the authorities to clear all incoming shipments and release held shipments, we will hold off on sending more Pebbles to Germany, including any reshipments.
&gt; In the meantime, we did improve invoices and provided a German manual online (available for download on our help portal), which has enabled some backers to retrieve their Pebbles from customs.
&gt; We expect Pebbles will be flowing to Germany again soon and we will contact German backers with details as soon as we know more.

**I am aware of the following official response following my first inquiry from Jun 25, 2013.**

&gt; As of this writing, two things are for certain:

&gt; 1) Pebble deliveries to Germany will resume.

&gt; 2) We're a few weeks away from being able to make that announcement.

&gt; When issues in Germany got to a point where putting them on hold made sense, we had hired specialists in the country to assist us with getting things back on track. The revisions to documentation and packaging which were requested of us didn't take much time to execute, and are ready to go.

&gt; The time consuming part right now involves additional requests made of us by the German agencies our specialists are coordinating with. Fulfilling these requests involves us getting quotes from potential sub-contractors and setting up extra business presences within the country.

&gt; These last steps are causing the delay. Why? Because there are different routes we can take as a company to reach the same result (unimpeded Pebble deliveries to Germany). Part of the work being done now is weighing the different options, vetting potential sub-contractors, and finding the right balance of speed and cost to get things back up and running.

&gt; For Kickstarter orders to Germany, we're leaning towards an option that increases the cost to us, but we're going to eat that cost as it lets us get Pebble in the hands of backers quickly after shipments are cleared to resume.

&gt; Non-Kickstarter orders to Germany will be similar to the fulfilment process for other ROW countries after shipments are cleared to resume, but with the revised documents and packaging we've set up.

&gt; When German deliveries resume, we're resolving the following issues:

&gt; * Getting Customs to release any Pebbles currently held in local offices.
&gt; * Reshipping any orders that were successfully returned to sender.
&gt; * Notifying our distribution centre that the orders we put on hold are green-lit for shipping.
&gt; Warranty replacement Pebbles to Germany are included in all of this, so both outstanding orders and RMAs will be sorted out once things start up again.


**I am aware of the following official response from Jul 11, 2013.**
&gt; Shipments to Germany are paused, but restarting soon. Out of 159 countries that we've shipped to, Germany has proven to be the most difficult. Half-way through shipping Black Pebbles to Germany, the customs and technology bureaus banned backers from picking up their Pebble from the post office. Unfortunately, the bureaus did not contact Pebble directly, which caused quite a bit of confusion on our side because we saw thousands of Pebbles successfully ship through to backers in Germany, even while some backers were running into issues. Eventually, we were able to work with German backers and lawyers to figure out what was going wrong. We paused all shipments to Germany, leaving roughly 2,700 Pebbles unshipped to German backers. At this time, we’re getting closer to a solution and have been in email contact with any German backers who reach out to us at kickstarter@getpebble.com



As it seems only a direct approach can force an update regarding the German shipment situation.

The ""few"" weeks mentioned in your last update are now 1 month and 18 days (or 1 month and 2 days based on the Jul 11 update). You have again failed to provide updates (satisfying or not).

German communities like [german-pebblers](http://www.german-pebblers.de/) are on thread page 165 regarding shipment issues in their ""Shipment"" section. The essence of their post is that there is no answer regarding e-mails/support tickets or that there are no updates in general and the discussion has now shifted towards refunding the money.

The whole situation can be described as a sad state of affairs and some clarity would be appreciated.

I'm not happy with Pebble but despite what they think (I'm banned on the Forum) I love the product but I think the way they have handled pretty much everything, sucks...from the lies told in the kickstarter video to the kickstarter backers still waiting 15 months after backing.

BUT...I think there is room for a genuine discussion which doesn't descend into name calling around the subject ""Is Pebble ready for the mainstream public?""

I don't think it is and for these reasons.

1. Garbled screens - seems like a lot being reported, tech geeks like us early adopters can probably just about accept it but will joe average? Mine is garbled and I have filed a RMA but due to being banned they will probably ignore it.

2. The new box says it works with iOS and as we all know, it doesn't...not properly and not all the time...unless you jailbreak. How many will be returned for that alone?

3. Whitelisting Apps. One of the best apps is smartwatch+ on cydia and the developer has stated he has an Apple compliant version ready but no one has really let him know what to do next. It's the same with ismoothrun and runkeeper which still does not show speed for cyclists

I'm done griping about this, life has to go on but I think they have interesting times ahead with best buy owners who will not be as understanding as some pebble owners.

The Android app would basically be a form to enter all necessary information, whereas the WatchApp would be a 3-button menu: Medical Info, Distress, 911. The latter two would require extra button presses in a very specific combination, as to not cause false alarms.

As a thanks to the Pebble Community, this app will definitely be free. If I can play around with the iOS SDK I can consider cloning the app for iPhone.

 I removed the protector to apply the second one, but it seems to have left a hard film in patches which is refusing to come off.  I'm reluctant to try anything too harsh which might scratch it or ruin the plastic lens. Soap and warm water didn't help, nor did a quick try with adhesive remover. Any suggestions?

http://i.imgur.com/vYJLSF4.jpg

Update: Tried vegetable oil, hotter water, a more generous coating of the adhesive remover, packing tape (sticking on the patches and pulling off), and scrubbing with a plastic scratch remover I had for my old iPod. All I've managed to do is add in some micro scratches from the rubbing and picking at it. I am going to try googone and then maybe the low strength alcohol suggested later.

I also tried picking at a patch near the edge with a razor blade and it doesn't pull off like glue. If I scrape, it kinda scratches off with difficulty so I am thinking it may actually be a layer of the lens :(

UPDATE2: Multiple attempts with adhesive removers, oils, heat and other things have not helped. I resorted to lightly picking at the edge of a patch with a razor to see if I could get it to lift like a sticker, but this doesnt work.  

As someone posted here: http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/18040/#Comment_18040
I think I may have ripped off part of the lens scratch protective layer. Arghhhhhhhhhhhh 
Next steps, will be try a few remaining suggestions but then resort to trying to rip off the rest, using another protector.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/19aata/problems_with_bluetoothpebble_app_staying/

since then, I've been talking to /u/pebble-matt and staring at android log dumps to try to work it out, and think I have found the culprit: Pandora. This app appears to slowly soak up bluetooth resources until there are none left for the pebble itself.

Slightly more technically, it seems to be grabbing a bluetooth handle every 30 minutes or so and never releasing it, and there's a global pool of these that eventually runs out. Toggling bluetooth will create a new pool of handles.

I'm still testing this out and haven't quite given it long enough to be sure, but after removing Pandora, this morning was the first time I woke up and my pebble was still connected, and it's been good all of today. So nearly 24 hours when previously it would only last for about 8 hours or so.

So try this, it'd be great to get some more data points. Hopefully (like me) you don't actually use Pandora on your phone all that much. If a couple of people confirmed it, I'll write up the documentation and send it to Pandora so they can hopefully fix it.

Stock Android 4.2.2, Nexus 4

Addendum for the technical:
The logs quickly fill with these errors when things are not working:

    D/BluetoothManagerService(  523): checkIfCallerIsForegroundUser: valid=true callingUser=0 foregroundUser=0
    W/BluetoothAdapter(23875): getBluetoothService() called with no BluetoothManagerCallback

and at one point, I caught this starting right after pandora got its 30-minutely kick from the system.

For example:
A friend texts me ""Are you on your way?""
My watch notifies me, I press the select button and this list of items appear.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.exampl.pebmsg

I've recently became interested in Lucid Dreaming, and am thinking about making a pebble companion for it. 

The app would remind you to dream checks (at a user specified interval). Another optional feature would be reminding you to note down your dreams (at a user specified time).

Finally, for the more expierenemtal Lucid Dreamers, it would wake you at user specified times in the middle of the night. 

It would be another incredibly basic WYSIWYG style, as I've found that the most elegant. 

What do you think /r/pebble, any thoughts or suggestions? 

Needed:

Icon designer (with portfolio) to create a simple and modern app icon, possibly a sleeping pebble. 

Translators from English to other languages. Just PM me with your skills and we'll go from there. 

These people will receive a portion of the proceeds or a pre-determined fee. 

Pricing:
It will be 98 cents if Google lets me, and I will offer full refunds for any reason, including transferring fees.

I'm not sure what's going on, I'd like to think that they've just been busy and haven't gotten around to approving my post, but when the person I'm talking to makes a post about it and still doesn't approve my post it makes it seem pretty fishy. We'll see if this post gets through...

**EDIT**: This post went through fine. I guess I was being a bit paranoid, but I hope you can all understand why.

My original post is quoted below:

&gt;Okay, let me preface this by saying I did not pre-purchase a pebble, only pre-ordered. That being said, I'm very upset with the way everything has turned out.
&gt;
&gt;I went into BB on Friday, excited to try to snag a Pebble early. When I talked to a sales rep, he told me he couldn't sell them until Sunday or the store would be fined. Totally content with that, I went home, excited to go in today and pick one up, thought about it all night, went to sleep.
&gt;
&gt;Saturday evening comes around, I've mostly forgotten about it, enjoying my weekend like I normally do, and I see pictures popping up from people who have picked up their pebbles already in store. Kind of upset, I figure at least my store will have them in stock tomorrow when I go pick it up. I forget about it again, and then I go out.
&gt;
&gt;I've been saving up for months, the day is finally here where I have a chance to get it. I go in today to pick up a watch, and the first thing I see is an employee in the Mobile department wearing one. He was talking to a customer at the desk and I didn't want to interrupt. Then I notice another employee wearing one. I think to myself, ""wait a minute, they only had three in stock... I hope they have more."" Finally I find someone who can help me. He has no idea what I'm talking about, so he goes to the desk where the first guy is, and the conversation goes something like this:
&gt;
&gt;* Man helping me: Do you know about a ""Pebble Smartwatch?""
&gt;* Woman at Mobile dept. desk: Yeah he has one *asks man sitting beside her* Where'd you get that?
&gt;* Man at Mobile dept desk: Oh I got this when they came out. We're sold out now.
&gt;
&gt;What the F.? So BB gets fined if a customer buys something before it comes out, but it's totally fine for an employee to do it, who knows if he even had a pre-order.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I know this isn't Pebble's fault, and I can't blame them for the way the employees bogarted all of the units, but there is plenty they could have done to prevent this. What about making a deal with BB over the pre-orders. BB can take the pre-orders [for the black watches] and stock stores by zip, with a couple extra units in each area, holding on to the pre-orders until they're picked up by a certain date, at which point they would go on sale to the general public [including employees without pre-orders.] I'm sure this deal has been talked about for at least weeks, and I thought of that idea less than a minute after I walked out of the store. The people who pre-ordered black watches would have no reason to be upset, and they could order more units if they see the watches picked up by that date. If not, the people who got other colors could go in after the date and pick up the leftover black watches.
&gt;
&gt;All in all, I'm very upset with /u/TeamPebble [Not specifically Joe, but the company overall] and Best Buy/Staff.
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR: Waited with a pre-order [not pre-purchase] for months, go to BB store near me who said they couldn't sell me them early, go in on the day they're supposed to sell them and see 2 of the 3 they had in stock the days before on the wrists of employees.**
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Added more detail about my interaction with the employee at the Mobile department desk.

There was also this reply to my original post:
&gt;If you want to blame someone, you have got to put all the blame on Pebble. They dumped their preorders, excuse me the mailing list (their term for you), and said go find one at BB. They said the deal with BB would help with distribution but there is no way in hell BB would sign up for or even attempt to fill Pebble's preorders. Why would they want the headache? I don't blame their employees one bit for snagging them. If you had to work retail and deal with fantastic/sarcasm people everyday and one perk was getting at the merch ahead of time would you think twice about snagging stuff?

1369353594.0	1exsyr	Using Pebble, Tasker, PebbleTasker and Pebble Notifier to buy a public transport ticket (it doesn't get any geekier).	Robrecht	18	4	0	"Granted, it's a pretty specific use case that's applicable only if you live in Flanders, use public transport, own a Pebble and an Android device, and are irredeemably geeky, but I thought it'd be fun to share.

In Flanders (Belgium), we can buy a tram or bus ticket by sending a text message to a specific number. I have set up my Pebble and Android phone so that I can do this by simply selecting a menu item on the watch (using PebbleTasker and Tasker). A popup menu on the phone then gives me the option to get a ticket that remains valid for 120 minutes instead of the standard 60, but after a few seconds it defaults to 60 and automatically sends the message, so that I don't have to take the phone out of my pocket.

When you buy a ticket this way, you get a reply message containing an alphanumeric code. Like all text messages, it buzzes the Pebble, so I get a quick confirmation of my purchase. Meanwhile, in the background, Tasker analyzes the message and extracts the ticket's expiration time (either 60 or 120 minutes into the future).

If I launch the app again before the ticket expires, Tasker, instead of buying a new one, sends a notification to my pebble saying my current ticket is still valid and reminding me of its expiration time; it also displays [a (kind of skeuomorphic) representation of the ticket](http://i.imgur.com/Uh7LpJ3.jpg) on my phone's screen, in case I have to show the code to a ticket inspector.

Finally, when the expiration time is reached, Tasker sends a reminder to my Pebble (""warning: ticket expired!"") and reinitializes the system so I can buy a new ticket if needed.

If anyone reading this is reminded of [this comic](http://xkcd.com/1205/): to be honest, I don't even take the bus that often... :-D

Oh yeah, in case anyone's still interested: I used Tasker's app factory to turn it into [a standalone app](http://j.mp/lijnticket). It should work out of the box if you have Pebble Notifier installed. If you want to launch it from the watch, you'll need to create a Tasker task that simply launches the app, and assign it to a button using PebbleTasker. Careful when testing, though: unless you quickly dismiss the popup on the phone, it WILL buy you a 1,45€ ticket!"	t5_2txls	True

So to make it crash be sure your pebble is connected to your phone via bluetooth. Once it is go to the pebble, go to 'Settings' --&gt; 'Bluetooth' --&gt; and Turn Bluetooth off. The pebble will now be in ""Airplane Mode."" Now that Bluetooth is off go to the music app and the Pebble will crash.

After 3 crashes it will go into safemode. Once you reconnect it to the iPhone it will prompt you to update the Pebble in the app to software version 1.9.1. Which is strange. Seems to downgrade your Pebble back to 1.9.0.

Can anyone confirm it does this on Android? You can try it since it doesn't actually boot to safemode until the third crash in a row.

Kind of scary since 1.9.1 was to fix the brick bug. Try at your own risk. Just wanted to get it out so it was addressed in the next software update.

1364922558.0	1bixsf	Pebble only has 2 MB of space for apps. Thoughts?	bamhm182	20	5	24	"https://twitter.com/Pebble/status/319001417392222209

A tweet from the Pebble team confirms that the Pebble only has 2 MB of internal storage for apps, but they also say that most current apps (just watchfaces??) are about 32KB each. As is in place now, the Pebble only lets you have 8 things installed at once. In theory, that would allow a maximum of 256 KB for each app.

Do you think that this is going to be enough space, or do you think that we're going to be hurting for space once the SDK eventually comes out?

I think it's possible it could be enough, but I also think it's going to be a bit of a hassle in the future, once there's more than just a handful of apps to install. I'm hoping that we'll be able to delete the 2 default watch faces to have a total of 10 apps once the watchface SDK is released since I don't use those anyway.

One thing that would make it a bit easier will be some all-in-one applications. For example, I imagine that once we have an official SDK, the maker of Augmented Smartwatch will make a standalone application, so we'll have everything that can control in one app.

It would also be nice to be able to uninstall some of the other default applications, like the music controls, and the Alarms app, because I'm almost certain that both of those will either be improved by a 3rd party developer, or included in an all-in-one app."	t5_2txls	True
1364680603.0	1bbob5	Utility of Watch faces	anishpar	17	3	14	"I just got my Pebble today (May 7 black pebble backer in US) and after playing around with it for a while, I realized that the way the new firmware update allows users to switch between watch faces could be used as a way of having extra widgets for your watch. This is slightly different from the Watchapps that get info from runkeeper, etc. 

I figure we obviously don't need 4 different watch faces to tell us the same time. However, what if someone made a watch face that only fetches weather info from the watch or one that only fetches upcoming calendar appointments/reminders, or one that fetches the time for a different part of the world.


The possibilities for these are endless. What do you guys think? This way we can keep one watch face for telling time while switching to the others for other immediate info we want.

I wish I could make these watch faces, but I have no experience in how to go about it. Which also explains why I don't know if watch faces are limited to fetching only certain types of data like time and date. But if any of you watch face designers like these ideas and can make one with ease, please do make one!!

TL;DR - Watch faces can be used better than how they are now. Don't you think?"	t5_2txls	True

If that's the case, it's going to compound the battery drain on my phone even more than having bluetooth on all day already does, so it's something I might opt to disable until there's a more direct integration with the gmail app (e.g. detecting the notifications locally, if that's currently not possible technically today)...

With my NATO band, the watch is so comfortable to wear I find myself using the alarm to wake me up in the morning. It's nice and quiet so I can get up early and let the wife keep sleeping. Anyway, here are some things I would like to see the alarm do:

Allow me to either set repeatable alarms, or set what days they go off. For example I'd like to be able to set up a Monday-Friday only alarm. Or ideally repeatable by day, week, etc like Outlook calendar items. My real schedule is every other Friday off. So I would set up Mon-Thurs alarms always and a Friday alarm that repeats every other week.

Reminders. Some way to have an alarm go off and the Pebble tell me something. Have it go off and me look at the watch and it says ""call the pharmacy."" Maybe just a tie-in to the phone calendar would do this? When a calendar event notification pops on my phone, it should show up on the Pebble.

1374219554.0	1imaq5	Dev Challenge: Chairman Mao Watch for Pebble	saltedlolly	19	4	15	"If you have ever visited China, an almost essential souvenir is the infamous Chairman Mao watch. The watch features a picture of Chairman Mao and his hand waves as it runs. It defininitely falls into the so-tacky-it's-awesome camp, and is a ""communist kitsch"" must have! The other thing about the watches is that, being cheaply made in China, they are also almost guaranteed to break after a few days of use....

Living in Beijing, I have been thinking recently that it would be awesome if the watch could be recreated as a Pebble watchface. I'd love to have Mao's mug waving back at me from my Pebble. It would also be good that the damn thing doesn't break after a few days. ;)

Since I'm not a coder myself, I am challenging a developer to create one. I'm sure the design could be adapted to look good. There are several different versions of the watch so changing it a bit wouldn't matter. I think the key thing though is the waving hand! Maybe on the Pebble this would have to wave for a minute on the hour to save battery.

Does anyone want to have a crack at it?

Here are some photos of different versions of the watch:

&gt;Shipments to Germany
&gt;
&gt;First, our apologies it has taken so long to get Pebbles to some of you. We are in touch with the German regulatory agencies and customs officials to confirm the steps required to ensure delivery of Pebbles in Germany.
&gt;
&gt;Until we have final resolution with the authorities to clear all incoming shipments and release held shipments, we will hold off on sending more Pebbles to Germany, including any reshipments.
&gt;
&gt;In the meantime, we did improve invoices and provided a German manual online (available for download on our help portal), which has enabled some backers to retrieve their Pebbles from customs.
&gt;
&gt;We expect Pebbles will be flowing to Germany again soon and we will contact German backers with details as soon as we know more.

It took months for it to be even mentioned on an update. And now almost a month later I am wondering what the hell is going on. Regular updates would be nice even if they stated the same thing that ""you are working on it"".

With more and more products from competitors around the corner and this hellish long waiting times I wonder why I even bother writing this.

From the excitement I had during the kickstarter campaign and after reading that shipping has begun is close to nothing left.

I just want to be kept in the loop. I knew very well that my money might be spent for nothing in return and that waiting times would probably exceed the original expectations. This is a PR problem (granted that Germans probably represents a minority of backers)."	t5_2txls	True

A better way to handle this would be to center the change on the five minute mark. So for the above time the watch face would read ""It Is Ten Past Two"" from 2:08 until 2:12, which would mean that it is only ever 2 minutes from the true time.

I'm not suggesting anyone try to test this on their pebble, as I would hate for it to be true and someone end up with a fancy black rock, but any information regarding the waterproofing would be appreciated.

**Edit:** Also if TeamPebble sees this, I would like to know what days the watches are shipped out from the factory. If there aren't specific days, what is the next ship day?

Watchface scrolling is pretty useless other than to show off different watchfaces. But if you installed ""Widgets"" alongside watchfaces, it'd be much more useful.

I made a simple example ""[Day Widget](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=433&amp;aName=RichardG&amp;pageTitle=Day+Widget&amp;auID=21)"". It's useful if you use a watchface without the date (eg Text Watch) but still want to quickly see the date when needed. You can simply press a button to go to the ""Day Widget"".

&gt;The strap can be removed from under the springbars. They have about 2mm clearance (little less). The strap is 1mm thick ~~20mm~~22mm wide.

&gt;I removed the springbars with my knife (don't do that). They aren't hard to take off if you've done it before. Use the tool that's made for it so not to damage anything.

1372861764.0	1hkgu3	Feature Idea: Navigation API	saltedlolly	11	1	6	"We already have the Sports API. My idea is to provide something similar for Navigation apps to interact with Pebble. (Maybe they could even be combined). A hiking or cycling app would then be able to send turn by turn notifications to the watch, as you approach each turn, vibrating to alert the wearer. E.g.

""In 200m turn left"" 
""At the roundabout take the third exit towards London.""

The update would include an image of the junction from the map, as well as other info such as the following nav instruction (in smaller text), as well as speed, time, ETA and other info. This would be great for Navigation Apps like Waze etc. as well as cycling apps.

I envisage this working similar to how Runkeeper works with Pebble - the watch display activates when you press start from the phone app.

Paid: 1/9/13
Shipped: 6/5/13
Received: 6/7/13

Ever since I received my Pebble, I have been looking for a replacement band.  Primarily because I actually do where it every day at work and want it to look slightly more professional than the stock strap.  After looking around these pages I came across the following ebay item:

[ebay link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/261154299564?var=560178509863&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649)

Seemed like a good price, I wasn't expecting top quality etc.  Placed my order on July 1st and got back an automated email saying that shipping will take 20 to 30 days.  Crap.  I didn't read the fine print that it was shipping from overseas.  However much to my surprise, when I got back from vacation on July 6th it was waiting for me.

First impression - definitely not a quality piece.  However again I was not expecting the world for $15 shipped.  Had a few nicks on it out of the bag, but overall as expected.

Removing the pebble band wasn't hard after watching this [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfSIXjmbtrE).

Putting the new band on was pretty easy.  It included two spring loaded bars but I reused the pebble ones.  I put it on and found it too big and started the process of removing links.  You can remove up to two links.  There is also a one step adjustment within the clasp, but it barely makes a difference.  I guess it might be useful for fine tuning.

So the challenge I am dealing with is that with the metal band (and I would presume any metal band, not just this one) is typically worn a little loose.  However with that, you lose the ""shake to backlight"" functionality as the watch starts to do a loop-d-loop around my wrist.  Also the vibration motor is not as pronounced, but at the same time more annoying due to the slight gap in some cases between watch and wrist.

At first I had two links out, which mimicked the feel of the stock band.  However this quickly was not acceptable and my wrist started to show red impressions from the band.  So I took a link out and I think I am at a pretty good compromise between fit and function.

I didn't set the correct time just to see when would it sync, and it finally synced about half an hour ago.

The watch was always connected with my phone.

Edit: 

I'm pretty sure that my watch wasn't synced for 10+ hours, and I got a missed phone call in that period. So, notification's don't update it.

Does anyone experienced similar issue? "	t5_2txls	True

1363036944.0	1a3snu	Non-destructive to semi-destructive ways to disable vibration?	MyPebbleIsOkay	14	4	22	"I really love my Pebble, but one tiny fatal flaw is really ruining it for me: vibration. I bought a Pebble to allow me to subtly check my notifications during meetings, but I've ultimately had to disable notifications during meetings (and most other situations where the Pebble would otherwise have been most useful) because the vibration is screaming out ""hey everyone! look at me! I'm vibrating! I'm so popular!"" Obviously in a professional setting, this isn't acceptable, so I find I just have to leave it off.

I'm looking for more creative ways to deal with this problem. Might there be a way to Bluetooth into the device and delete drivers for the vibration motor? Or perhaps a way to go in and edit the code itself to disable it? Taking it to more of an extreme, has anyone tried to crack open the Pebble to remove the vibration motor itself? I imagine this would destroy the water tightness, but I'd still rather a Pebble I could use during meetings over one I can use in the shower. Are there other options I'm not considering? I'm willing to lose vibration and watertightness permanently.

Think the Pebble team would replace my Pebble if I gave the latter option a try and messed up? :P^just ^kidding^(mostly)"	t5_2txls	True
1362885201.0	1a07hv	ISSUE: iPhone will not properly enter Standby	STM127	14	4	8	"ISSUE: iPhone will not properly enter Standby
PROBLEM: Excessive battery usage


Settings&gt; General&gt; Usage

Time since last full charge

Usage (This time is increasing despite being locked)

Standby (This time will match above time is the bug is occurring after a full charge)

 

TEMPORARY SOLUTION 1: Turn off Bluetooth
(Pairing with the Pebble will start the bug again.)

 

TEMPORARY SOLUTION 2: Forget Pebble, Close Pebble App, Reboot Device, Re-pair with Pebble

 

CAUSE(?): I suspect this bug is related to the Bluetooth profile of the Pebble on iOS. When making a call or using Siri, the Pebble is a option to choose from as if it is a Bluetooth headset. After ending a call using the Pebble button, I believe this is how the bug is triggered. However, I would like some other thoughts and opinions on the matter. Is it possible to look at a file which shows what Bluetooth services iOS is allowing the Pebble to use?

1362336964.0	19l6l1	Android app idea: media control for all PC media apps (with back-of-a-napkin implementation)	baudvine	14	3	4	"The ability to control music on my phone is neat, but the ability to control music on my computer would be excellent as well.  After seeing the post about the Rdio app I figured it might be possible to control at least play/pause/next/prev on my PC from my Pebble.

The basic idea is to have an app on the phone appear as a media player much like the Rdio app does, so the Pebble media controls are passed to it. Then pass that to a listener on the PC (much like other remote control apps do).  Instead of controlling a single app, though, this listener should be able to fire a multimedia key event that can be caught by whatever media app you've got running on the computer.

I'm *pretty* sure every part of this has been implemented before across several applications, but I can't seem to find anything that puts them together. I'm also pretty sure I could build it, but I've never done any serious Android dev and I don't have a truckload of time so it'd take a while. **If anyone wants to make this happen before I forget about it, feel free. Please do.**  If anyone knows an app that already does this, even better - link please.

I also feel like hitting the Back button from the main menu should return to the most recently used watch face.  But that's just a little nitpick.

From the engadget review, the only available option when receiving a phone call is to remove the notification from pebble. I'd like to present a full integration idea:

When receiving an incoming call, the 3 buttons would be able to control Answer, Ignore, To Voicemail. If answered, there could be options for End Call and Mute. Paired with a bluetooth hands free headset and you wouldn't need to take out your phone at all. End Call should require multiple presses incase the button gets pressed accidentally.

Maybe if you press ignore or to voicemail, it would display an option to send a auto-generated text message. Using the up and down selections to select which message to use and sending it with the selection button.

- Is the Pebble shipping directly from China, or to a distributor in the US or Hong Kong to handle the orders individually? (This is common)
- What service is being used to ship the Pebble?
- Will backers get a confirmation email when their watch is shipped?
- Will backers receive a tracking number when their watch is shipped?

I have a Kindle, and I was envisioning that type of display. During the CES keynote they mentioned that it's e-paper, not e-ink like the Kindle and that it uses very little power when static (which is not the same as no power). And now that I am paying closer attention, I am seeing ""monochrome LCD"" everywhere I look.

So, what is e-paper if it's not e-ink? The wiki article for e-paper talks about e-ink type displays not traditional LCDs. Is it just a marketing term for a monochrome LCD? Is this just a high resolution version of what's on a calculator?
