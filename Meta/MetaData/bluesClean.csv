The roots go back further than that, but 1912 is generally recognized as the 'origin' of the blues. So take a bit of time this year to celebrate a century of the modern world's most influential musical form!

It would make it a little easier for me.. BUT maybe this is also a great way to get some people exposed to new songs!

Edit: I see the responses slowly pouring in.  It's great!  I think I'll leave it up for a good 24 hours to make sure everyone gets a chance to throw in their opinion.

EDIT:   [Spotify Playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/alien005/playlist/6Yz0ZpzySCmFyHwWxERv9l)  Enjoy.  The link was giving me some trouble.  Let me know if it still is.  I had to unlink my FB cause it would display my full name and everything.  Which is concerning and frustrating.

Or instead of updating this thread, should I start a new one as an ""UPDATE""?

Me and my dad managed to sneak down and get 5th row seats for most of the show. It felt like he put on a show, instead of just playing music.

It's quickly becoming my favorite dance, and I would like to know more about Blues, as music. 

Now, to my questions:

Anyone mind giving me a quick history lesson? I read the wikipedia on the subject, but it reads like a detailed textbook, leaving me without a clear understanding of the flow of the music through time. I'm looking more for the big picture, rather than all the little details, I guess.

One of my other musical interests is metal. I bring this up because there is a resource called [The Map of Metal](mapofmetal.com). Is there anything like that for blues?

Does anyone else here Blues dance? If so, what are you favorite songs to dance to? I've been working on a [playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4D369E0FC249C1A3) of blues and blues-y songs (still a work in progress; some songs I like, others will probably get removed). Any opinions on songs you like, don't like, and/or think should be added?

He was white, a little bit older and had a beard (I.'m pretty sure) his name was something along the lines of an adjective and then a name.
