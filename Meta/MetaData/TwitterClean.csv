1375067812.0	1j95ax	My name is Joe Mande. I'm on a quest to get a million #bots to follow me on Twitter. Please help me.	joemande	115	27	24	"Hello. My name is Joe Mande. I am a comedian and television writer. A week ago, my Twitter account (@JoeMande) had plateaued somewhere around 80,000 followers. I was going nowhere fast.

That is why I decided to make it my personal goal to buy 1,000,000 #bots to follow me on Twitter. So far, it's gone pretty well; I've purchased about 100K #bots up to this point. However, my sources are very shady characters from places like Pakistan and Moldova.  I can't in good conscious keep buying what I can only assume are #BloodBots.

That is why I am coming to Reddit for help.  I'm looking to recruit someone out there to build me an army of non-conflict #bots for cash. I figure an enterprising young American hacker can do just as well as some jerk in Moldova. 

Granted, my notion of a ""hacker"" hasn't changed since I saw Johnny Mnemonic in seventh grade. But I pray to the Lord above that one of you redditors can help me reach 1 milli.

Thank you. 

Love,

Joe Mande "	t5_2qhwg	True

Together r/twitter can have a DRAMATIC influence on the direction twitter takes. we can get Hashtags trending, we can get discussion of issues going. But r/twitter is also an amazing opportunity for us to take the science of twitter and teach each other strategy, stats, funny tweets, and help us discover accounts (not whore our own) that would be worth following!

Some of you may have noticed that you're now an ""approved submitter"" for /r/Twitter.  This simply means I think you're a decent reddit user and your posts won't go to the spam filter.  If you're reading this post and want to be an approved submitter, please leave a message and I'll add you so long as:

1.  If/when you submit, you submit from more than one domain.
2.  Your account is older than a day or two.
3.  You've submitted and/or commented in the past.

Some of you have noticed we've been having some trouble with posts that look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wgmME.png) and [that.](http://i.imgur.com/KNIoc.png)  We get about two to five dozen of those posts a day.  While our [spam filter](http://i.imgur.com/Y2FRg.png) picks up most of them, some still slip through.  **If you see a post that looks like this, please help out the community by downvoting it and clicking ""report.""**  In addition to training the spam filter, I'm considering a few alternatives to discourage those posts (including moving toward temporary approved-submitter systems during a few hours of the late-evening/early-morning).  If any other solution comes to your mind, please mention it.

Again, if you want to be an approved submitter and are not one already, please leave a comment."	t5_2qhwg	True

They are not quality posts and seem to distract from what the intention of this subreddit really is""Twitter mashups, tips &amp; tricks, news. Everything Twitter!""

I haven't seen any submission guidelines for this subreddit. Maybe we can consider creating some and posting them on the sidebar?

Also, there's an ongoing list of redditor's twitter account. It's linked right here on the sidebar, and even provides a link to message the mods to get added. I think this is a great idea and would rather see people encouraged to use that.

Thanks for consideration

EDIT: Almost a week later and this thread is still on the front page of /r/twitter.  I've seen the MODS being active in this subreddit, but they've not yet chimed in, either in a PM to me or in the comments. This sucks and speaks to the quality of this subreddit.

1334067926.0	s2k1s	Here are my best Twitter tips and tricks. What are yours?	atleroge	21	5	11	"1. Make lists. In particular make a list of ""people you know in real life.""  This starts to make twitter a little bit more like FB (in a good way). 

2. Use a program like [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com) to monitor multiple twitter streams. For example a you can follow all four of these on the screen at the same time: 1. a particular # topic, 2. your real life friend list, 3. your @ replies, and 4. your own tweets.

3. Use [Twitter Karma](http://dossy.org/twitter/karma/) to check who you are following who isn't following you back. They can be sorted by number of followers, etc. Maybe unfollow some of them you don't recognize. Or tweet at them something interesting. Many of them who you tweet at will start to follow you back.

4. Do cool shit in life and tweet about it. Go to concerts and tweet at the band and at the venue that the show rocked. Or explore abandoned buildings and tweet a picture of some urban decay. Or make a 3D print at a local fabrication studio and tweet a picture of it.

5. Tweet good articles that you find on Reddit at experts in the respective field. You can find prominent twitter figures in any subject at [Wefollow](http://wefollow.com/).

6. Tweet funny one-liners that come into your head. Especially late at night when drunk. These are some of the tweets that get the most attention.

7. Use [Klout](http://klout.com/). Seriously, it's awesome. Notice which twitter events drive up your Klout score. Focus on generating those kinds of events again. Mouse over your name in the top right of your Klout profile and click on ""friends"" from the dropdown menu. Now you can see your most influential friends.Also get the Klout plugin that shows you everyone's Klout score automatically. 

**Quick way to pick up a bunch of followers:** Find a twitter person who is a real life friend of yours who is popular and smart and cool but hasn't been on twitter very long and only has about 100 followers. Go follow all the people who follow them. About 20 people will follow you back. Keep following the ones who followed you, but go unfollow the others who didn't follow you back. You can do these following sprees regularly, but always unfollow the people who didn't follow you back after a few days or your twitter stream will clog up with junk and your follower/followee ratio with shrink (bad). Some people look down on this activity, but it seems ethical to me as long as you don't unfollow the users who followed you back. Only unfollow the people who didn't follow you back. What do you think?

With how fast things move (e.g. hashtags in searches), I get the impression that it's near impossible for someone new to get noticed, even with good one-liners put out everyday.

Am I right in thinking there's so much luck involved in getting noticed on Twitter that one can't expect to succeed even if they put out good content?

If not, any tips on gaining followers initially? The net seems to be filled with guides on how to increase follower count and what type of tweets to send, but I can't seem to find much about the first step.

And how long do you reckon it takes an account to gain a following of, say, 1,000, and then 10,000, if the account focuses on putting out good one-liners without abusing hashtags and the like?"	t5_2qhwg	True

I have a couple of questions I hope you guys can answer:

How should you handle the accounts of the apps or companies you use?
Like, every company out there asks you to follow them back, sometime they follow you first (in my case), what's the point to follow them back? Usually, I tweet at them only if something is not working and I'm looking for help...

I wouldn't mind following them and putting them in a list, and use another primary list, but if I'm using a mobile app, the first thing I'll be seeing is my primary feed, not a defined list I want primarily and I would of course get the entire tweets of everyone...


What should I be doing with the accounts of magazines or blogs if I already have them in google reader? it's redundant... (and while we're on the subject, what's the point to have the exact same thing on your rss reader, twitter, google+ and facebook and why do they want you to follow them everywhere so badly? shouldn't they be using each service differently???)


How do you connect with people you don't know, but yet are still relevant to the field you work in (and following them brings you the stuff they share that is relevant to you)?


Just so we're clear, I'm not looking for some magical formula or recipe to get new followers, but rather, how should I use twitter to get the most out of it for me? No matter how I look at it, I can't figure out how or if I should mix the type of stuff i'm sharing (in my case startups/web dev/ web design and ""men lifestyle &amp; fashion) and how I should interact with the twitter world beyond just sharing stuff.... like how can you possibly build little by little a following of two types of different people who decide to follow me for different reasons? tweeting in french and english on the same account for instance... doesn't seem like a good idea....

so, how do you do it?"	t5_2qhwg	True

It's gotten to the point where I really just don't use twitter anymore for anything other than posting updates to my own blog and occasionally retweeting something funny.

Is this how everyone else functions on twitter or is there some way to sort out the shit? Should I just unfollow everyone I couldn't give a shit about following?

Because I follow just 100 accounts, I can read everything that's on my timeline if I check every couple of hours. There's lots of links posted too, so reading takes more time than just scrolling through my timeline.

Now, many people follow several hundreds of accounts, including news accounts tweeting once every couple of minutes. How do they use Twitter? Scroll through their timeline extremely fast? Only read what's posted just now? Wouldn't that be pointless, since if someone tweets interesting stuff at a time when you can't check Twitter, you'll miss that content.

tl;dr: People post cool stuff even when you're not checking Twitter. I can't stand missing these updates.

Edit: what makes it difficult is that I'm in Europe, but many accounts I follow are from America, so I'll miss a lot of that if I don't read tweets posted while I was asleep."	t5_2qhwg	True

I don't even need to include a hashtag to get this spam. So I went through who is following me and found inactive accounts that look real and then the obvious no tweets or spam tweeters.

It's a pretty good idea actually, they have a few accounts that have real tweets and real looking profile info and the user is pretty active and then they follow someone. You don't block because at the time it looks like a real person.

What they do is take that accounts following list and every time someone tweets, they spam them from a different unrelated account that you can't trace back to them. It's kind of like a trojan horse.

So I reported them all for spam and blocked them and hopefully I won't get anymore spam, unless I use a hashtag a bot is watching.

So, I've contributed to my own problem by adding Favorites that I intend to revisit (usually links or a tweet I wanted to reply to) and totally forgetting about them.

I am resorting to somewhat organizing them manually by searching for certain accounts or keywords with the Find function in my browser and then un-Favorite-ing and/or clicking through a link and just adding it to my browser bookmarks.

I would totally resort to doing this manually for Favorites I know go back years but at a certain point, the tweets listed in my Favorites don't have the gold star in the upper right-hand corner and can't be un-Favorited. I've thought of starring then unstarring but I don't know if that would work and that's just way to much effort.

I read that Favorites is just rudimentary that way and that there have been third-party sites aimed to help but not anymore.

My dream for this function consists of:
*first of all, being able to do something with my older Favorites that don't have the star
*being able to filter tweets that had links
*being able to search for Favorites from specific accounts
*being able to group Favorites by the accounts in which Lists you have or just manually (like an account could be in your List called ""Comedians"" but instead you then and there create a group called ""Comedians and Radio Hosts"" or something like that for your Favorites)

There's probably one or two things more.

Any ideas. Or is this an SOL situation at the moment?

Little did I know that the complete redesign is flawed and basically a complete 180 from the previous version.  No more posting of links or link shortening, which is honestly the reason I got it in the first place.  I love finding links to cool things or newsworthy stories and tweeting them to my friends/followers. I thought that is what Twitter was honestly all about, and Tweetdeck did it in one easy step. Now I can't even copy and paste a link into my tweets on there.  The new design is in my opinion nothing special.  On the old TweetDeck I got 4 columns on the main screen, could pick the colors I liked so it would be something fun as well. 

I really wish Twitter would have not messed with TweetDeck in its old form. There was honestly nothing wrong with it and I loved the fact it took care of everything.  Now if I want to post a link on Twitter, I have to go to a separate site to shorten the link, then tweet it, then post to Facebook right after that.  The old TweetDeck did all of these things in one step.  And Twitter took that away from everyone.  

I have sent queries to Twitter, but they have gone unanswered.  I hope someone out there has the same feeling I do.  I wish I could go back to the old version, but I can't find it anywhere.

I have also had it running and it crashes at least once an hour, whereas the old version never crashed.

1373627237.0	1i59wi	How to download or simply acquire the text of someone's entire twitter feed?	genebeam	11	0	6	"I want to get a copy of the entire twitter feed of someone with a more than 80,000 tweets. I'm content copying and pasting-special (text only) into a text editor document, if only I could copy the whole feed at once. Just scrolling straight down their page stops working after a while. If you use Twitter's advanced search, specify the user, and include no search terms, you get a version of their twitter feed you can endlessly scroll. But it takes forever and gets slower and slower as you go as your browser is (I guess) storing all that data. My browser crashes less than halfway through. So it doesn't even work to leave a weight on my down-arrow key and leave it for a few hours. (Yea, I'm not the most savvy computer person).

All I need is the plain text of their twitter feed. There has to be a better way. Googling this puts you on a wild goose chase of methods that no longer work after an API change. 

To be sure, this is someone else's twitter feed; these multiple tools for downloading my own feed are not helpful.

(using a dumbphone for twitter)	iamfreakingdeaf	9	1	1	"Hey, I'm cutting back on my tech addiction and have quit facebook and other online services. My only social media now is my blog and twitter account. I have been trying to find peoples, news, and other sources to follow on twitter that does not spam with headline and links.

Basically, my phone is a dumbphone without wifi or data plan. For example, I tried to find a daily bible verse account and most of what I have found just refers to the verse location and a link to the actual verses. I would like to find one that actually put as much of the verses in the tweet as possible.

Basically this is what I am struggling with finding on various topics on twitter.

Any suggestions of who to follow on twitter that does not use links?

Thanks.

P.S. I am still relatively new to actually using twitter via sms only so if I have missed anything obvious, my apologies.

1342055969.0	wf135	How do I even get started understanding Twitter?	neon_overload	11	2	7	"I've had a Twitter profile for a few years now and have Tweeted several things, but I still feel as if I cannot understand what is going on and what draws people to it.

I know exactly how it works, and how to use it to reply, retweet, and add hashtags.  I'm even a web developer and have even developed Twitter integration into various websites where I've been employed.   I have great difficulty finding how I can make Twitter useful to me, or see how it could be useful to others.

So I guess what I'm looking for is a tutorial about Twitter which doesn't simply just show you how to use it, and isn't simply aimed at ""marketing"" people for how to use it to promote their sites or campaigns, but how an ordinary person can get value out of it.

I also have a couple of questions for long-time Twitter users:

- What prior forms of communication, if ever, does Twitter replace for the masses?

- Of all the people I follow, one of them tweets 300+ tweets a day, whereas pretty much every one else I follow (of about 50 people) tweets maybe 1 to 10 times per day.  Is this normal?  I have a hard time even understanding what his 300+ tweets are going on about, because most of them refer to previous conversations or things I'm simply not in on, and Twitter doesn't provide (or very rarely provides) any context to a Tweet, unlike online forums where you follow a topic.  A fair few of them are simply thanking people for retweeting him or mentioning him in a blog, or whatever - seems to have no actual ""content"" and nothing that I, who didn't read the blog post or see what was retweeted, can recognise. Should I simply not follow someone like that?  What can you do to figure out what is going on, and ensure that other people's otherwise interesting tweets are not hidden whenever a 300+ friend starts one of these ""conversations"" about topics I've not been let in on?

- Why do mainstream media use it so much, even on the TV news, etc.  If anything was going to become this popular, you'd think it would not be tweets, which are limited to 140 characters and frankly look like a bunch of source code in a programming language I've never learned half the time - we have forums, things like Reddit, etc, which appear way more friendly.

I'm sorry if I've exposed the level of my ignorance here.  I wanted to ask in a place where I was relatively anonymous."	t5_2qhwg	True

If you want to have your Twitter account next to your Reddit user name in /r/Twitter, just look to the side panel and click ""edit"" next to your user name.  The rest should be self-explanatory.

I apologize for being behind the curve in terms of enabling this functionality, but the reason is we had/have been using an older, CSS-based way of assigning flair.  In order to assign user flair, one of the moderators would update the style sheet for every user who has provided their Twitter account in the forum in order to connect with other redditors.  While the approach looks nice and I would generally add users to our Twitter list at the same time as a stylesheet update, it leaves the matter of how to edit, remove, or hide personal information out of the hands of the individual users.  

The old method also takes a bit of extra work on the part of the moderators to look up a user's Reddit ID number and then copy and paste the relevant information into the stylesheet.  I know that doesn't sound like much, but, after doing it a few hundred times, it adds up.

So far, I've done what I can to transfer our system of ""old flair"" to ""new flair.""  This meant going through older moderator messages and ""follow each other"" threads, commenting out the old flair in the stylesheet and reassigning it using new flair functionality.  Unfortunately, there were sixteen users who I could not account for in the stylesheet.  If your account still has the ""old flair"" that isn't editable, let me know and I'll change it."	t5_2qhwg	True

First, new rules:

There appears to be some [opposition](http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/xkle8/request_for_the_mods_can_we_discourage_people/) to people posting solely to promote their Twitter profile and to ask for followers.  So, unless there is considerable support for allowing it, we are going to start removing these kinds of posts.

In addition, blogspam here seems to often be ""10 Tips for Getting More Followers"" or ""7 Twitter Secrets You MUST Know!""  Sometimes, despite the spammy nature, these can provide good insight.  However, they're typically just the same unoriginal crap everyone already knows.  So, no more generic Twitter tip posts.

Do you have other rules you'd like us to entertain?  Add them to the discussion!

Second, promotion:

This subreddit is small.  We need more active members in order to really minimize spam or low-quality posts.  Even if someone makes it through with their crap post, the downvotes aren't enough to knock it off the first page due to the low new activity.  

So, some options I'm thinking about:  Recruiting ""lieutenants"" to post something new each day.  For instance, maybe one of you decides to be the guy who posts the celebrity tweet of the day.  Or someone in charge of finding and posting interesting Twitter accounts.  If we could come up with some ideas for regular kinds of posts and put a few people in charge of posting them daily (or so), then we'd have more new content and activity here to help minimize spam problems. 

We also need new members.  Here are some suggestions on how you can help with this:

* Do you blog?  If you mention Twitter or something Twitter-related, consider linking it to this subreddit.  Your readers might check us out. Also, the links could help us eventually rank on Google for Twitter-related searches.

* Link to our subreddit from other Reddit posts.  As you comment around Reddit, if you mention Twitter, drop a link to /r/twitter.  Let people know it's out here. 

If you have more ideas about promoting this subreddit, getting new subscribers or increasing activity, please discuss further.

------------------------------------------------

**Proposed New Rules:**

MicrobialWhale	6	1	7	"The public news agency in my country has been taken over by the majority party and is being used to make propaganda for their own party and to attack the other parties using money from the public Treasury. But since there seems to be no public attention about it, I decided I wanted to create a twitter account to parody theirs, to point out what they're doing.

So I created the account, gave it a similar name and then I thought... the best way to give this account visibility would be to reply some of the agency's twits and posting the same, only changing the article title, while preserving the link to their article.

Problem is... when I made the 4th reply to their account I got mine suspended. Few minutes after I somehow came across a captcha that restored my account. So I though ""Oh, ok... they just want to make sure I'm not a bot, so I can keep posting as long as I fill in these captchas every now and then"". Not the case. I made two twits more and they suspended me for good. Or at least for the past 48 hours.

Questions are:

1. Is my account ever going to be restored?

2. Is there any way I can preserve this... ""ideal"" workflow (replying the parodied account) without getting suspended?

3. If the answer to the question before is ""no"", what would be a recommendable workflow that wouldn't get me suspended?

A quick Google search for the problem and I stumbled onto this [Quora post](http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-my-tweets-show-in-hashtag-feeds). Here's the relevant part:

&gt; 1) Incomplete Bio:  
&gt; You might not have completely filled out your name and bio in your profile (so it might look like an account set up for spamming).

&gt; 2) New or Low Activity Account:  
&gt; You might not yet have tweeted much, thus not looking like a legitimate account or your account might be brand-new.

Are they serious? I wasn't even aware there was a place to fill in the bio until after my first tweet and does Twitter really consider new or low activity accounts to be suspicious?

Why in the hell would I continue using the service if my tweets are only visible to myself? I guess Twitter assumes that people really want to use their service and will jump through whatever hoops needed to make things work.

I had an account for years, tweeted away merrily. Then I decided to use that account, account 1, for my blog and naturally the tweets increased. At one point I was on my 60th tweet, within perhaps an hour, when the account suddenly got suspended. This was during a race I was updating on, btw.

I clicked the small link I got on my account and was told to reply to an email I received. I did. Nothing. Then after two and a half weeks, of me desperately trying to find out what happened - only to be re-directed again and again and receiving numerous ticket answers, like, ""your account could have been suspended for aggressive following"", which I didn´t, my account was suddenly open again. Huzzah!

In the meantime I opened a new one, account 2. I remembered that I should probably not write that many tweets so rapidly, so last Sunday I started tweeting a little bit. Updated the followers and whatnot. Bam! Shut down again! For the exact same thing I didn´t do in the first place.

The pnly answer I get from Twitter´s automated reply ""service"", is that I *might* have been doing some aggressive following, which means I will have to follow hundreds of accounts in a small amount of time, and at the same time, write to all these hundreds of accounts. I made 47 tweets last Sunday.

As I have been trying for over one month now to find ANYONE who has an answer to why this is happening, especially when so many accounts I follow, that makes more tweets are not suspended, I really am interested in knowing what the hell is going on.

1306879958.0	hokiq	New to Twitter, got some questions!	oizown	7	0	7	"So I'm REAL late to this whole Twitter thing, but I've had an idea that I'd like to try out using the service and am curious as to how exactly I get involved in this follower/following routine. 

Before I get into the idea, I have read the other posts here and have followed a whole bunch of redditors, as that seemed to be a good place to start. Plus, you guys/girls are usually very clever, creative, and original, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

Now, I'm a writer, or at least I consider myself to be one. Others may disagree of course :P I've written for a few magazines and websites, but my true love is fiction. 

My idea is this; I would like to have people tweet me thoughts. Thoughts, ideas, story ideas, random musings...basically what twitter is already used for. I would like them to send me things they would like to see a story made out of, or made around, or just to be included in a story. I am going to take some of these ideas and incorporate them all into a story (novel-length if this gets enough attention, but really any length will make me happy). 

The real catch is that I am also going to include the person who tweets the idea into the story, using their twitter history to gauge who they are and what they would do in a certain situation (most likely the thought/situation they suggest).

So basically, someone tweets a fantastic idea about zombie rehab (as someone already has on my facebook), and since I think that is fantastic, I use that person as a character in the very narrative involving zombie rehab.

My question to you redditors is this; how do I go about getting people to start tweeting me stuff? Do I just ask for it? Do I buy some ad space? Do I make reddit posts? I don't need millions of people participating, although of course the more the merrier, but I would like to be able to have this branch out and get all sorts of cultures and people represented. 

Or am I going about this all the wrong way? I've never used Twitter before, but it seems that its service is perfect for this idea I have. 

Any help you may provide will be rewarded. Maybe I'll send you a postcard. Maybe I'll write a sex-scene with ScarJo and you (or for the ladies, Bradley Cooper and you). Maybe I'll just say thanks. The possibilities are endless! Either way, thank you in advance for any help my fellow redditors. 


**TLDR** How do I get started on Twitter? With the end goal being to write a story using input from the public and the actual people who do the inputting.

(one last thing; I'm not putting the link up right yet, just so you all don't misinterpret this as an attempt to get followers. I like to do things proper and without sleazy tactics at tricking people into doing stuff, but if you want the link, I can give it to you :)"	t5_2qhwg	True

If you look at the account on Twitter, you have to hit the ""expand"" button on every single Tweet to determine if there was a conversation. So we're forced to click on ""expand"" on hundreds of Tweets just to be able to see and copy any responses that were sent. 

If there was a way to just get a copy of every Tweet ever sent to that account without having to do that, then we might be able to just go through that list a little more efficiently. 

We've attempted to use Twitter search for ""@WaterPortal"" but we're not sure that's turning up everything (without having to click expand). Or if it is, it's definitely not easy to go through the Twitter interface to parse hundreds of Tweets.

If we could even get all those Tweets somehow downloaded and into an Excel page, that would be amazing. I know there used to be way to download Tweets as an .xml file that could be manipulated via Excel, but I think Twitter changed their API so that was no longer possible.

I've done a lot searching and it seems that twitter does not keep a historical record of followers. So unless you've used a 3rd party service that records follower numbers there is no way to know how many followers you had on day 1 or day 365.

I was talking with a friend today who claimed that anybody can get their account verified (so that the little blue ""tick"" icon appears next to their name) but I was sure this wasn't true.  
  
After looking into it just now, I found that as expected, Twitter doesn't offer any way of achieving verification status -- at least not for us common folk anyway. They say it is ""used to establish authenticity for accounts who deal with identity confusion regularly on Twitter"". *[Source](http://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/119135-about-verified-accounts)*  
  
However, I also found an external video which apparently guides you through a process of just three simple steps to getting your account verified. *[Link](http://www.5min.com/Video/How-to-Verify-your-twitter-account-174495429)*  
  
The first of these steps requires you to register with another website (www.crederity.com) and assign your Twitter account to your account on there. This immediately had the alarm bells ringing for me, but I thought it couldn't hurt to ask reddit for a second opinion anyway.  
  
If this is in fact a load of rubbish, I'm still wondering how even the people who actually need it, get their accounts verified. How can Twitter be sure that someone is who they say they are and how do they define a famous person (as opposed to ""the public"")?"	t5_2qhwg	True

This is clearly not a good thing, but Twitter provides a means for blocking contact from users that is undesirable and so this can be quickly dealt with.

For me, Twitter represents a platform where everyone can have a voice. Apparently though, the ability to block someone from contacting you isn't enough. The following petition has been started at change.org:

https://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/twitter-add-a-report-abuse-button-to-tweets

The idea being that if someone offends you, you can report them to Twitter who can then make a decision to suspend the user's account. They're also proposing policy changes to make ""abuse"" against the Twitter TOS.

Quite quickly, this censorship, denying of a platform to those whose views may ""offend"" (read ""disagree with"") some Twitter users, will erode free speech. This could be the start of the end for the platform that has helped so many people oppressed by their governments, journalists, etc.

Obviously, where something is illegal, such as a rape threat, it should be dealt with by the Police. Still, where does Twitter come into this? If someone threatens you in public, say in a shopping center, you'd go to the police, not the shopping center management, to make your complaint.

This seems like an over reaction; using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I don't deny there's a problem, but this is not the way to go about fixing it."	t5_2qhwg	True

In my day-to-day life I'm an academic historian and have recently been looking at the problems around using digital content as primary sources in research. As well as problems of anonymity and the longevity of data, access has come up as a major issue.

At the moment, it is possible to create a tweet archive of accounts you have control of that comes in a nice little package that you can browse and search by date. However, Twitter has the additional dimension of #tag conversations created when multiple and often unrelated accounts all post with a particular #tag. In order to determine the narrative of events using Twitter (some examples being the eviction of Occupy Melbourne, election night conversations, etc) researchers will need to find a way to archive and search #tag conversations.

I tweet about it, then check the website and all of a sudden I have... what is this? 325 followers? This can't be right! I check again a couple of minutes later and.... 361! This is bizarre!

About 20 minutes pass, and I decide to check to see if it has returned to normal, and it went up. Again. All the way to 442. It peaked out at 492 before returning to normal. Well, 13 higher than what I started at, but I didn't have that many people follow me.

Is there a bug? or did a whole bunch of spam accounts get unbanned?

I have my Twitter set to protected, so people have to send a request to follow me. I usually only accept people I actually know, so once in a while, when I get a request from a random person/company etc, I will decline.

But the last week or so, after I've clicked Decline, and go back to the home page, the notification ""1 new follower request"" is still there. And it doesn't go away for days.  
This has happened 3 times in the past week or 2, and the only way to stop the notification (and stop having to click Decline 100 times only for it to do nothing) is to block the requester. Which seems unfair, as I doubt they're spamming me with requests or anything, but I can't get the requests to go away.

However, both accounts were shut down after only their first tweet.  For the first account I used Twitterfeed, so I thought maybe Twitter was catching that service as a false negative given that so many spammers use the service, so I switched to ifttt for the second account but it also was shut down after the first tweet.  These subreddits don't even have many submissions at all, there's a new submission maybe every few days, so they're definitely not spamming in any way.

Has anyone had any luck in getting a Twitter account to feed submissions from Reddit without the account being falsely suspended?  And/or do you know how to best get these accounts un-suspended (I've already sent in appeal tickets).

EDIT: I was thinking just now.  I do have another Twitter account that also posts from an RSS feed (not Reddit, but from my college's RSS feed); is it possible that they're picking up all Reddit related feeds as false-negatives?
