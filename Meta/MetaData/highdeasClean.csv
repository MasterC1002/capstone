There are 63,360 inches in a mile, and if you divide this by 5.5, you get 11,520. This is your EPM (Erections Per Mile), and could theoretically be used to calculate other things (such as how many erections you'd need to get to the moon, etc.).

The badge would ideally hold enough hours of battery life to securely make it through the shift of the average police officer. If the officer's camera is turned off at any point of the shift, he should face an obstruction, with severity depending on the time and severity of the matter at which it was turned off. 

I don't see what big city police stations could possibly be against this measure. It helps them prosecute real criminals easier, and should also help innocent people not be falsely accused.

Also, in cases of police brutality, they can refer to the tape to see if it actually happened.

All of a sudden, the other casino doesn't accept your chips (credits don't transfer). Right then, you have a reason not to go to other casinos (go to other schools), and have the best chance of winning your money back (getting a degree quickly enough and able to land you a job to pay back the loans) by continuing to spend more money in the original casino (more loans) to do so.

We spend so much money on other countries in the form of foreign aid and wars abroad that I think could be better spent at home. 

So, bear with me here, we should set aside an obscene pile of money, pick the absolute worst area(s) in each state, I mean totally impoverished neighborhoods that are in dire need of infrastructure, jobs, and good schools, and dump that large pile of money on the neighborhoods. Figuratively of course. Use the army core of engineers to organize an effort to rebuild roads, sidewalks, schools, and create new housing and commercial districts. Hire local people to do the labor, and spend 5 years or so building up the 50 worst neighborhoods in america. In the process you will pump that money into the local economy one paycheck at a time, and then commercial businesses will follow since the local people have money to start a small business and/or spend on goods. Jobs will be created and the local economy will be boosted. Good, well funded schools will help encourage an educated workforce and once again, the economy is boosted. Empty lots are turned into parks and nice apartments and everybody in and around the area will benifit from the effort. 

If it works, then you just keep picking neighborhoods until each community in the united states is a place that anyone would want to live in.

1358144170.0	16je1b	My favorite part about being high	VT_phonehome	30	7	4	"My favorite part about being high is getting lost in your thoughts.
I could not decide tonight whether I was making much sense or none at all but I could tell you that I felt incredibly insightful. I was reading, doing homework and, of course, figured, what better way to make this experience a little bit less miserable than with a bowl of purp. I took the first hit and immediately became more invested in my reading. I started taking notes, responding with pen &amp; paper to what I thought about the quotes that stood out the most to me.  And all the while I'm thinking, I'm not really sure if what I'm writing down makes any sense right now, but it sure fucking sounds good and seems to make a whole lot of sense. But that's kinda the whole point of highdeas. Your mind, begins to jump around, fast, nimble, so much so that it is almost like a pinball machine. It's like, when I read the information that interests me (the fact that it is interesting to me is also probably crucial) the question, or quote enters my mind and merges onto a highway and can drive past tons and tons of cities, take many exits, and detours, see many different ideas, all very rapidly. Rampant tangents of high thoughts. 

But, the benefit of this is that your mind can make connections in response to a stimuli incredibly rapidly. I think that this is really where a lot of the 'insightfulness' feeling comes from. I get on a track and follow it as far as I can go until I either hit a dead end or lose interest and get off on another gigantic tangent--typically, one that I am equally as enthusiastic about. 

So, I guess a question I have is if any of you get that type of experience in order to get your highdeas? Or, do they come about differently? I mean, that Carl Sagan essay from a little while ago on Reddit about weed talked a lot about his experiences of doing his work while high. And it said that he would make notes to his sober self proving that he was of sound mind and that he should take these insights seriously. Do you think there's anything to that? Like that, for some reason because weed is illegal and so discounted/frowned down upon in society that even we question our own minds' validity when we are high? There I go again, more tangents.

Arthropods breathe through their skin using tubes called spiracles. With higher oxygen, these tubes could grow much larger, increasing the size of the bug exponentially. So what if we raised generations of spiders in an oxygen rich environment, starting with like 10-15% more oxygen, and gradually raising that number over generations? Could the spiders re-adapt to such oxygen levels and become massive? If so, could we use these large spiders for silk harvesting, as spider silk is one of the strongest and most useful naturally occurring substances? And to those who say the spiders would be dangerous: living in such an oxygen rich environment, if they were to escape into the outside world, they would smother and die after a short time.

Rumple then comes back and bites her in the ass and he haggles with her and then allows her a concession that she has three days to guess his name yadda yadda and she has no idea who this dude is so she guesses his name the first two days and then is like ""fuck this"" and so she sends a messenger to figure out his name and the of course the messenger asks the king because the king rules the land and knows a lot of people. he says ""his name is Rumpelstiltskin. tell her you saw him dancing around some fire singing his name or some shit like that. as if any good villain would celebrate early... anyway, go. go go. make something up. and tell her the name."" and the messenger was like ""could you please repeat that name? its pretty weird and i want to make sure i remember it correctly."" and the king is like ""Rumpelstiltskin."" and the messenger goes off. okay so then the messenger returns to the girl with the name and shes like ""HAHA!"" and the next day she gets to keep the baby and rumple pretends to die or he throws a massive tantrum or something like that and the girls like ""i defeated the villainous Rumpelstiltskin!"" and she thinks shes a hero. or the harbinger of goodness. when in actuality shes a victim of social norms and double standards and she thinks shes happy and this is what she wants, but it isnt, not deep down. its fine if it was her goal all along. but the fact that it wasnt yet she thinks it was... sickens me."	t5_2qy0n	True

Imagine the beats of noise flowing out of an instrument. Now it forms into words and meaning. These forms of words sing to your ear. Now your body moves along to the meaning of beats. It tells you to dance, and you dance. It tells you to cry, so you cry. Words are powerful, and so is music. Therefore they are the same. Genres are types of languages that we appease to; French, English, Rock, Acoustic, Jazz, Japanese, etc. Music was what our ancestors spoke. Music is what we all understand.

Now bare with me, what if humans were a force put on earth to slowly dissolve life as we know it?  Humans will over populate and destroy the earth eventually by draining it of it’s resources and making it ultimately disappear.  

What if after this an outside power put a life form on say Mars and that society than ran a similar course as earth, eventually destroying that planet?  What if this cycle continued on all the planets and they were destroyed and no longer existed.

1348908073.0	10nthh	Society after some hash and a few shots of whiskey (x-post from /r/trees)	mattacular2001	21	0	11	"First and foremost, anybody who says that marijuana is incapable of opening up your mind to completely new ways of thinking is just ignorant. So ignorant. For many reasons.
But, staying on track: I had so many revelations tonight about society as a whole. I've never really thought of it that way, but I know see it as a ""system."" When people say things like ""fuck the system,"" they often fall by the wayside as just random moments of somebody being facetious in regards to how stoners may typically talk, but in reality, I think that people have just forgotten how it worked.

""Get schooled, pay for college, get a job""; and pretty much everything else that we're told. Our minds are so, so constricted by, forget conditioning for now, but just limitations put on us by society. You need to fit the mold, because odds are that if you don't, you will not survive here. That's just a fact. Now, onto how it limits us. We are all conditioned from birth to be who we are. What are we, really? Does true autonomy exist? Or is it that we are so similar in so many ways as parts of society that minuscule differences are just exaggerated in contrast? Look at how many things there are that we are given boundaries for when in reality those boundaries are only artificial. Despite that, people accept these boundaries as legitimate because they are indoctrinated into a ""system"" that tells them such.

A perfect example of this is our political system. We have two parties that say that they have ""extremists"" or ""fringe people,"" but are they really fringe people? Both parties believe in Democracy, representation, some form of Capitalism, and ""human rights"" (the rights that Americans have and so insist that they are universally right when in reality there is no such thing as a universal truth.) Nobody in the system sympathizes with Marx. Nobody in the system sympathizes with Jefferson. They two parties are the same with just minor differences in how things are implemented. The philosophy of what is implemented is completely the same, though. Nobody seems to get that. That being said, even the whole ""left and right"" way of categorizing everything becomes totally obsolete the moment that people actually start thinking about things instead of just going solely off of what they are told. And last is this whole idea of ""money."" Everybody wants money so they can feel superiority or so they can survive when they've known nothing but the opposite. Those are the two ends of the spectra as far as I can see, anyway. But what's the point? Everyone gets a job so that they can make money. Why? Because that way they can afford to buy things that they need. Things that they actually need to survive. Well here's a thought: If everybody just opened their eyes up for a second, they'd realize that there is enough of everything to go around and not have to deal with having to do anything. There is such a great concentration of wealth in such a small amount of people that it compensates for the immensity of poverty in this country 4 fold. So why do these people actually have money, whether they realize it or not? Power. Money was invented to give people power or at least does so indirectly.

And that's what society is all about, really. Everyone's relative power. So, I'll say it again now that you all know where I'm coming from:

Fuck the system. Fuck the system that you're born into, have no choice but to adhere to, and at the same time loathe even though you are conditioned to be a part of it. If that doesn't scream that true human nature is being completely violated, I don't know what does."	t5_2qy0n	True

1. Maybe the world is just a simulation made by evil magic robots who use our bodies to experiment on. They took over the world and used our bodies to run experiments on. To make sure we wouldn’t wake up in the surgery (because the surgeries are really painful) they put us in a simulation. Each person gets their own simulation, and so everyone is connected to their world in a very real way. Our mind starts to realize subconsciously we are in a simulation, but your conscious mind doesn’t know. So our minds grow plants like weed and LSD in our simulation which only have mental effects. Notice how so many plants have mental effects, but none have physical effects? This is because your mind has no bearing on your body. But drugs really make you sort of feel what’s really happening to your body in the real world, i.e., the painful surgeries, and start to see more of the real world (hallucinations). Police that are against drugs and lawmakers and shit are just evil mind probes from the evil robots that don’t want you using drugs because they don’t want you to wake up during the experiments.

1a. Also, our mind tries to snap us back into reality with hurricanes. I saw this picture that showed all of the hurricanes, and it looked like a man spitting out gum. That’s because the simulation is caused by a gum imbued with magical powers that puts people in a simulation.

2. When people have an audience, they abandon integrity and sense. What if there is an objective “logic” and sense, that people with audiences are really abandoning? Wouldn’t that make them bad people? Ergo, it’s okay to call Justin Bieber a bad person because for all we know he could be, by abandoning objective sense.

3. Every theory is possible, no matter what.

4. All optical illusions are actually just gifs. Even when it’s on paper, librarians are magic.

5. Alligators are just dragons, disguising as a slightly less scary version to lay low so they can sneak attack and kill us humans.

6. I forgot to mention that dragons are real. DRAGONS ARE REAL!

8. “Alice In Wonderland” is just the adventures of a small girl walking upstairs to go to bed in her typical suburban home. She is just autistic. All the funny animals she meets are just her parents making little things in her day fun.

9. I am God, doubting myself because God is depressed :( I’m just God’s self esteem. And Jeff Buckley is God’s self-confident side. And that’s why Jeff Buckley is such a badass, God likes to pamper his self-confident side. My mission is to kill Jeff Buckley.

10. All music is just a different fake simulation for high people to enter. That’s why you feel awesome when you listen to music while high, you’re actually going to a secret dimension.

11. The whole world is just a joke, and all the things that happen to us are the joke trying to make us laugh. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Like cupboards, cupboards are serious business.

12. Everyone has a mission to kill another person in the world, and if you remember who it is and you kill that person, you get a prize. Murderers are just people that realized their mission.

13. Terrorist have long, confusing names to confuse Americans. Americans often get confused by long names.

14. Jeff Buckley died a decade and a half ago. If you can’t complete your mission, you don’t go to heaven. 

Dammit.

15. People are just chess pieces in a game of chess played between God and the Devil. How to escape the game is just to realize if you are a black piece or a white piece. No, it isn’t determined by skin colour you racist.

16. We are in a simulation and the only way to escape it is the Sun. The Sun is an anomaly in their coding. If the Sun melts everything, we would see reality. That is why global warming needs to happen. Environmentalists are just evil mind probes from the evil robots that don’t want the sun to melt everything. Also, when the evil robots know how to fix their code and get rid of the Sun, it will explode. That is why we need it to burn everything before our chance to escape disappears forever.

17. What if America is never happened.

18. People that recreate great works of art with like toast or some shit are actually the real creators of that art reincarnated. That is why they don’t talk much.

19. Need for stuff is actually really relative.

20. Time is actually going a lot faster than we think, our mind just makes up the brief social encounters and details and shit.

21. The North Pole is just heaven. That is why God looks so much like Santa Claus, and why everyone says reindeer exist but you’ve never actually seen one.

22. Weed is actually the most hallucinogenic drug, you actually hallucinate everything. That is why people tend to forget what happens when they’re high, it’s because none of it actually did happen.

23. Boxxy is actually the Queen of Everything and /b/tards are just the people smart enough to realize it. Also /b/tards are smart in this version of the world.

24. Water is the earth’s skin, that is why it is cut so easily. Land is just gross growths on the earth because it has bad personal hygiene. Some planets don’t have any land, those are planets who take care of themselves. Mars is that super gross guy everyone knows.

Jim and Pam arrive to prepare a prank on Dwight, who, because of an obscure Amish religion, will spend the day wearing a suit of golden armor to resemble the visage of the Amish demigod Ukeziel, who was believed to have descended from the sun to serve as the light of Jesus' path to salvation. Jim has switched out Dwight's golden armor with hastily spray-painted aluminum foil while Pam has installed a trap door beneath Dwight's desk, plunging into a dark pit occupied by an unknown - but loud - tenant.    
    
Meanwhile, Jan has come to the Scranton office to admonish Michael's recent spate of expenses in long distance calls to remote regions of Romania on company time. Michael claims that after seeing INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, he came emboldened by what he describes as Christian Slater's ""musky, rugged appeal to middle-aged women, teenagers, and hardened, truck-stop grizzled female grifters living the nomad's life, wild and untamed."" Threatening to report the absurd impetus to the corporate office, Jan relents when Michael produces the curriculum vitae of one Count Dracula, who is scheduled for a mid-management position interview at the Scranton office that very afternoon.    
    
In the annex, Ryan has developed a means of human transformation: an experimental mutagen developed using the DNA of crustaceans. Ryan convinces Kelly to take the injection, only then revealing the syringe was only full of air, thereby killing Kelly. Ryan immediately unhinges his jaw and consumes her corpse, finishing devouring her only moments before Dwight appears to borrow their stapler. Seizing the opportunity, Ryan secretly slips a dosage of mutagen into a nearby coffee cup - which, in turn, is drank by Meredith.    
    
In the interim, Pam dislodges her head from her body and reveals it has the power not only to levitate itself and effectively fly, but to disperse enormously powerful laser beams from its eyes. Pam uses these eye lasers to carve a mountainous monument to Jim, a testament to her undying love for him and the power she shall wield in his name as she lay waste to the cities of the Earth. Jim, impressed by the naked and wanton exercise of power, reveals he is in high the mortal vessel of the Sumerian God Hya-Ku Nuhl, a being of pure energy sent to Earth to serve as guardian over the seasons and what he refers to as ""the changing of the light."" Revealing his true form, a shimmering pool of galactic power, Pam and Jim temporarily meld into the same being, allowing the immense powers of the universe to overwhelm and enhance them.    
    
Once injected with the crustacean mutagen, Meredith slowly begins transforming into a hideous hybrid, her form growing a grisly exoskeleton, eye stalks, pincers, and enormous mandibles. She immediately begins to destroy her surroundings, nearly decapitating Toby and razing the whole of the brake room. Her co-workers begin to engage her in battle in the vain hopes of beating her back and possibly getting her drunk enough to pass out so they could smash her head in with Stanley's chair.    
    
Angela invokes the name of Yahweh through an ancient Amish ritual with the help of Dwight's texts and library of grimoires; in a flash of blinding light, however, the voice of an Archangel is heard and Angela is quickly condemned to plunge into a Stygian realm of hire and torment. Luckily, Dwight repels the Archangel because of his resemblance to Ukeziel, saving Angela and being deemed ""a righteous death dealer"" by the Archangel, thereby endowing Dwight with fantastic powers beyond the dreams of mortal men. His first act upon being bestowed with this grand power cosmic is to melt the flesh from Angela's bones, savoring every nanosecond of pain, and reducing her form to a pool of liquefied pulp, and pronouncing he would find a new queen to join him at his right hand and rule over the misty Realms of Schrute, where justice prevails and the tyranny of the Mechani-Hordes shall be kept at by the magic of the Elders.    
    
During a brief and unnoticed lunar eclipse, Count Dracula arrives at the office for his interview, creeping into the conference room in the form of a ghostly green fog. Immediately, Count Dracula victimizes Jan, plunging his fangs into her neck repeatedly and lapping up her blood from the conference table walls and floor. A nonplussed Toby suggests to Michael they flee, but Michael mistakes it for his opportunity to play the lead and ask the questions in the interview, so she stays as Dracula greedily drinks the remainder of Jan's blood and she begins the process of becoming a vampire herself. Toby, fearful for his life, urinates himself.    
    
With Meredith run amok, the battle soon spills over as a radioactive Stanley is hurled through the office, crash landing at reception. The mutated Meredith beast arrives to wreck havoc only to be turned back by the bionic Oscar, whose head has become a mighty piston, and Kevin in a suit of Nazi armor. Unfortunately, Meredith's back spores burst and spray both Oscar and Kevin with mutagen, horribly mutating them into a squid-men even as Meredith lay dying.    
    
Seizing an opportunity amidst the chaos, Toby and Michael make a break for it and hide amongst the rubble during the battle, attempting to flee Count Dracula. Enraged, Dracula sends a vampirized Jan after Michael, who tempts him with offers of sex Michael is unable to turn down. Approaching the vampire Jan, Michael is saved only by Jim's last minute staking of Jan, a move of intense telekinesis of which Jim has only learned of. Together, Michael and Jim unite into one being - DEFENDOR, MECHA-MAN OF TAURUS CENTARI - and does battle with Count Dracula.    
    
Pam and Jim emerge from their cocoon of energy, transformed into genderless Gods of the Fourth Dimension, endowed with an understanding of the space-time continuum. Together, the Jim-God and Pam-God dissolve, with only a thought, Count Dracula, and revert Meredith to her human form, deciding, however, it would be best to leave Jan as a dead vampire. Michael and Toby, transforming into their separate forms, find the traces of a companionship in their new experience, but Michael is still hesitant to get too close to Toby. Nonetheless, Toby has his entire body tattooed with Michael's name, culminating in a particularly brutal sequence as Dwight watches Toby and masturbates from a nearby window. Unknown to Dwight, the exposure to his genitals has left Toby vulnerable to ghost rape, a traditional Amish form of possession whereby an ancestor invades the urethra of its host and begins to change their behavior.    
    
The Jim-God and Pam-God resume their places amongst the office but reveal their presence is unnecessary; with their united powers, they are omniscent and omnipresent, able to make all sales and take all calls with limited to no effort. They remain because, as Jim-God says, ""The errors of these mere mortals does please my lofty brow."" Pam-God mentions their lack of genitals is a low point, but guesses it was a fair trade off for ""knowing everything ever.""    
    
Finally, we see Ryan has spent the entire episode in the women's bathroom. He reveals his intent to replace the brains of Stanley, Oscar, and Kevin with a centuries-advanced technology he has gained through Dunder-Mifflin's time travel division, thereby transforming them into his Ryan Sentries, able to do his bidding without the burden of morals or pain.    
    
At the episode's end, we see the denizens of Gallifrey and the Time Lord High Council declare war upon the office, as a wormhole opens in the skies over Scranton. The newly formed Jim-God and Pam-God prepare for war against the Daleks and their leaders, the Time Lords, even as Michael must prepare to transfer his consciousness into an invincible robot body with which he can battle his newly-formed foes, the Congressional Committee of Crime, whose bodyguards happen to be a privately-hired Dwight Shrute.

A dozen lifetimes of fighting the darkness and evil of Hyrule has left a stain on Link's soul that must be purged. 

The final boss fight is against Shadow-Link, this represents Link slaying the last remaining Evil in his heart. Afterwards he uses the Triforce to awaken princess Zelda. I like to imagine that as he finally gained control of the Triforce in it's entirety all of his memories, from all of the past games came flooding back. All the way to Skyward Sword. And that when he brought Zelda back he did the same for her; restoring all her memories from all her past lives. And she remembered her hero, the knight who braved unknown evils to save her again and again. 

Finally the curse was broken and the endless circle came to an end. As the two lovers who began the epic cycle of Good Vs Evil at the dawn of this ancient nation are finally allowed to be together at it's twilight. The last King and Queen of Hyrule. And thus ends The Adventures of Link.

1363242776.0	1a9s3w	Let's talk about scales. (X-Post from /r/trees)	P0uncer	19	3	12	"The typical scale used to measure one's high is [1-10]. I've often found myself struggling to place my high on that scale, and I think I've found out why meow.

Lately, I've been paying more attention to the strains that I've been smoking. I ask my guy for a name whenever I pick up, and if I'm smoking with others I ask them if they know what stuff they have. Not only that; I've also been looking up more about the science behind my high (the strains indica vs sativa, mostly).

I'm doing this, because the highs from different strains can actually be quite different. I smoke mostly to treat my depression. Before, I only smoked recreationally every month or less often even. Now I smoke almost every day, and I try to smoke the blends that give you energy, motivation and wake you up during the day.

I brought up the scale, because of what I just mentioned: different strains do different thangs. So you can't use one linear scale to describe your sensation and be very accurately describing your state of mind at all... Here's a quick visual to show what I mean. 

However, in order for this to work, people need to be familiar with strains, or at least familiar with the effects of the different chemicals they're putting into their bodies. Otherwise, you can't communicate about them without explaining first everything I've been talking about.

For example, I started writing this while I was high as fuck, but it was my buddy's stuff, and he didn't get a name, so to describe the high, I have to circumlocute by saying it's a ""heady, buzz behind the eyes and a lightness in the chest"". I could say it was a [9], but what does that really tell you? If I had a name, i could tell you it was ""a [9] from blueberry headband"" or something, and if you're familiar with that strain you'd know what I'm talking about.


**TL;DR** The [1-10] scale doesn't tell you much at all about another's state of mind, because different strains give you different sensations. Instead, try describing the high, or in addition to [1-10], add the name of the buds you were sparking. [intense and heady, buzz behind the eyes and a lightness in the chest]"	t5_2qy0n	True

If all atoms and sub atomic particles stop moving entirely at O k (0 Kelvin), Then doesn't that mean that time has stopped as well? Since humans can only perceive time through motion, one would think that this is true. Just think about it, even though a clock might sit still, it requires the ability to move to tell time. We move from one moment to the next only because particles in our brains move and send messages, so if those particles can't move time has essentially stopped hasn't it? This would also contribute to a thought that time doesn't just go forward or backward, it is simply a compilation of things that happen in an entirely random order, if any order at all. Thus, this would explain why time travel is so difficult to grasp because time isn't a tangible object. 	t5_2qy0n	True

Cloven_Tongue	21	5	4	"It's a plan that's been a long time coming: the purchase and re-appropriation of Manhattan Island.

Resistance by force and by legislation has do only so much, and this is the next step: a quiet, legal campaign for regime change.

Once Manhattan is claimed, the land revenue (Central Park alone is 40 trillion dollars), will go towards purchasing NY state, New England, the entire eastern seaboard, then back WEST on a victory lap, snatchin' up all kinds of area codes and building on them. MAD WAMPUM, kid.

Following would be an increase in Native American (NA) households, leading to widespread counties of single tribes.  Political influence would find it simple to re-arrange borders to fit the populace and geographical demands of a given tribe. 

Media influence would reflect the dominant populace, and have nothing but NA-centric programming and advertisements. Public opinion would follow to favor NA traits and population as a higher social class than the rest, fitting in the lynch pin of the secret circle of chief's master plan.

Over time, all the power that fell into the hands of a scattered nation, would now lay in NA hands- concentration camps, pogroms, peyote cartels - in the Chinese sense, it would be a very ""interesting"" period.

1367446086.0	1die0g	How to create levitation with a graphene sphere.	I_Has_A_Hat	23	10	4	"Ok so obviously the main limitation with this highdea is that there is not currently a way to create a graphene sphere, but lets move past that.

Right now, there are really only two ways to make something float without machinary, fill it with hydrogen or helium as both are lighter than air. However hydrogen can be extremely dangerous (Hindenburg), and helium is in short supply. But there's something even lighter than hydrogen and helium and is much safer, a vacuum. Hypothetically if you had a vacuum in a large enough container and also light enough, the container would float.

This idea has been around for a while, the only problem with it is there's no material that has the strength to support a vacuum while still being light. Enter graphene. 

If you haven't heard of it yet, graphene is most easily visualized as an atomic-scale chicken wire made of carbon atoms and their bonds. It's basicly a one-molecule thick sheet of carbon. It's only recently that researchers have begun studying it. It has some interesting electric and thermal properties but for the sake of this highdea we're concerned with its mechanical properties.

Graphene is strong, thats an understatement. It's rediculously strong. It has a breaking strength 100 times greater than steel and a 1 square meter sheet of it could support a 4kg cat while only weighing as much as one of it's whiskers.

So, to wrap this whole thing up, if an airtight container made out graphene were somehow created and all the air was removed, you would have something with more lift than anything made before. The potential applications for this are, as you can imagine, vast.

I noticed that all of the images and things occuring were all familiar to me.  That got me thinking about where I could have seen these things, and caused me to dig back to memories in the recent past...and then it hit me!  What if the things I was seeing were ideas I had before as a baby?  

Think about it, what if when we're babies (between 2 months and 2 years), we imagine or dream of vivid images, events, or things that recquire a more adaptive and intellectual imagination?  

Which also made me think about how the two most sacred times in a human life are life and the wonders about the beginning and death and what happens after.  As a believer in the possibility of reincarnation. I thought that what if when we die we remember every single experience, memory, or thought we've ever had since we grew a brain?  And after remembering these things, we make a mental note of it in our souls that is to be released into the new mind of the new body (which would be an unborn fetus), and stored in the depths of our subconcious as soon as we start to learn how to process thought.  

Which brings me to my last point: what if marijuana helps you obtain access to your deepest subconcious?  And that is why you are able to see (or rather...remember) all of the images.

Experiment will be done where after this hibernation period, the snail wakes up in a medium (relative to the snail) room surrounded by LED’s (excluding the floor and roof). We can now bring this snail on an evolutionary journey.
Experiment

Snail wakes up after 3 years of hibernation surrounded by LED TVs. These LED TVs simulate an environment where the snail has to adapt to something awesome, which will biologically lead to evolution after a long period of time. Further research will be done as to what I want to turn the snail into. The snail can reproduce by introducing another snail that has been subjected to the same experiment. The resulting snail will also be a part of the experiment, and the cycle continues as long as human participation is present. 
Summary

This experiment will take a long while with no clear outcome or hypothesis. But it has never been done before, and is a relatively cheap experiment and the potential for learning is massive.

is only because Plato did not have the ability to quantify such an idea.
With increasingly complex mathematical systems, computational systems, we get
closer and closer to being able to model everything with pinpoint accuracy.Now
a days, truth is becoming easier as information about everything is becoming
increasingly easier to access. One can be assured that bridge is safe, by
determining structural integrity, but one does this mathematics, which
eventually will get complex enough so that almost nothing is forget. Risk
management, will be incredibly complicated, such that nothing that can go wrong
will go wrong. But it is these decisions that are what make belief interesting.
They make life interesting, as one can never be entirely sure the choice they
make is the right one.The not knowing, the outcome for the person, the
effect they have. That cannot be quantified. And that is philosophy.
But what if all this emotion can be quanitfied? so that it is all logic?
AI would become possible. At least AI with human qualities.

But if math and the rules of the universe are the same everywhere, civilizations
should develop similarly. But quite frankly thats impossible, because alien

1356245686.0	15bfy1	"A chat room with a novel ""white-out"" feature, to promote conversation."	gameryamen	16	5	2	"Let me start by saying that I don't think there's a market for this at all, and that it would be nearly impossible to pitch.

I want a chat room where, at will or at random, users are ""whited-out"" for a minute or two. During that time, they would only get indications that someone (unidentified) had sent a message. They would not see any of the messages, and would be unable to send messages. At the end of the period, everything would be returned to normal, but the chat log would be cleared. They would not be able to directly monitor or check the chat during the white-out. 

The idea is that sometimes conversations become dominated by a few individuals. It's sort of built into the way we talk. A lot of our sentences use question and response. This means that even though no one is being exclusive, the language itself sounds like dialect between two people, and we subconsciously accept that.

By sporadically removing participants, you break the natural flow of conversation. This, in my mind, would promote attention. If you knew you could miss out on any one minute of the chat, you'd make sure you were paying attention to the chat enough to try to piece together the gap. It would also promote participation, because in order to keep a conversation going, new voices are needed. 

I know this sounds like an awful, frustrating user experience, but I think there's a lot of potential for interesting social interaction in a shifting conversational space. One light hearted idea is to play a room-wide prank on someone who's currently whited-out, say pretending to have devovled into a hate filled rage fest. 

In my farthest imaginations, the spark of this idea came with a poetic image: A user logging in after a stressful day and announcing to the room ""please self white-out for a minute. I really need to vent, but I don't want you guys to hear the first part."" This may sound extremely attention whorish, but I felt a deeper meaning. This person had become attached to the *character* of the shifting chat space, as though it were itself a place of meaning where one could express their feelings without judgment.

The government would then develop a smart phone application that any tax paying citizen could use to call a ride from the publicly funded self driving cars as a public utility taxi service.

With citizen consent, all modern cars would be taken off the road, citizens would be able to call the nearest free vehicle of their requested size to get them where they want to go.  

Vehicles could be re-imagined and could take on the image of small lounges, entertainment centers, work stations, meditation, training rooms, or any other purpose the populace desires in a specific region.

Driverless vehicles would essentially negate traffic accidents caused by human error, and by making it a public utility, a certain degree of maintenance can be enforced, preventing the majority of possible accidents, and deaths, on the road.

By making them solar powered, the current technology requires them to be localized, and road trips would be slightly more complicated, but it would also all but eliminate the need for gasoline in transportation (most of which is a foreign import), which is better for the environment and the American economy. We should also look to utilizing technology similar to the [supercapcitor that can charge an iphone in 20-30 seconds] (http://www.electronista.com/articles/13/05/20/capacitors.supports.10k.recharge.cycles/) so that the machines are powered nearly perpetually.

Tax dollars previously dedicated to public transportation, fighting DUI's, and the like can be directed at this, though it would likely be a very large initial investment.

DD's would also no longer be necessary, and consumption of alcohol or any other substance could in fact take place within the vehicle with absolutely no danger to any travelers, within or without the vehicle.

The biggest push back I can see for the driverless car utility is that to be truly effective, no human error could be afforded on the roads, and so there would be very, very few who could drive manually.

Would you guys want this service?

Seeing as we don't have the powers to do this, we must consider something more practical. If we learn to create social bridges where, instead of condemning, we emphasize difference, therefore teaching tolerance and open mindedness, everyone will not only be respectful of differences, but will also enjoy it, relish in it, and ultimately learn from it.

It seems like such a stupid and obvious manipulation, but we just accept it as not being abnormal.  And yet I'm sure we internalize it and subconsciously it manipulates us.  The music they use is the music we can identify connotations of (e.g. masculine, hip/positive, futuristic/sophisticated).

But she just kinda looked at me as I laughed for about 5 minutes with a smile on her face. And she goes     

""Don't take this the wrong way cause I mean it in a nice way.. but one of the things I love about you is that you think you're so funny."" And at first I was like thinking back to 1st and 2nd grade when everyone just knows there's that one weird fat kid that flings boogers and eats worms during recess that thinks he's funny. You know? like do you get that? And I was like am I Keith from Mrs. Henrich's 2nd grade math class?       

But then I understood it in a different way of thinking - a perspective, or attitude for that matter on what she had said. And then I was like wow... that's pretty insane man. She is like me in 2nd grade. But not even remotely close it's just kinda like the concept.... It always stays the same. Just like how I still know that dudes name today.       

And then she was like ""I'm glad to see you mellow"" and I thought to myself ""Slipknot"" and absolutely lost my marbles.

Have you ever been to a US military base in, say, Germany? The shit's wild! As soon as your car gets through the checkpoint, it's like you've just been dipped like a soft-serve cone into another world. 

Granted, this new world is full of gravel and sharp things that go boom, but you've now got a lot of the comforts of stateside living what-with Burger King and English-language channels. Not having to think thrice before speaking is also a great comfort, but I'm getting off point.

What I'm saying is that if America can maintain bases in foreign countries, what kinds of concessions or even demands did the U.S. make for that kind of deal to go down? Not like we haven't got the stash, but that's a lot of hookers and cocaine for a bunch of (maybe) elected folks out yonder."	t5_2qy0n	True

I realized that these reports only exist because one guy wrote it down in one manuscript once, and it happend to be saved in a library or a house that didn't happen to get bombed or burned during all the wars that have happened in Europe since that time, and it got me thinking: Archæologists and Historians use both those records, along with marginalia (little notes written in the margins of manuscripts) to try to figure out exactly what day-to-day life was like for people of that time. 

I figure, it stands to reason that in the future, Archæologists and Historians will have a much easier time figuring out what was going on, since it's highly likely that a lot of our own personal videos and photos we take on our iPods and computers will leave a really good record. Thing is, a lot of those personal videos and such aren't likely to survive the transition from one medium to another, so they're likely to be largely lost; we'll still have a lot of professional media from those times (since they're spread out across the whole net and people want to make copies of them, not just limited to a couple of computers). Archæologists and Historians will want to dig up old computers and harvest the hard drives to find out exactly what makes us tick. Think of how we look at ancient burial grounds or ruins of cities and how the people there leave behind a record.

In the ruins of our civilization the academics of the future will use data recovered from our computers as a means of reconstructing day-to-day life in a way that would make an Archæologist-of-today's mouth water."	t5_2qy0n	True

Here are the gems I've found so far! I think there are more text files hidden around here. Anyway, they're not necessarily highdeas, but I sure had a laugh going back and reading them.

""Sometimes I get two personalities, and one is conscience and the other is the high. Well, these personalities are at war. But my mind perceives this war as a Pokemon battle. So when my conscience wins my mind goes back to the image of the Pokemon battle, but when my high wins it takes me off on tangents. During this whole thing, I'm just watching this unfold as another Pokemon battle. Like, Inception shit. The struggle to write this was enormous.

My mind likes to fuck with me. It keeps making me think about things and then take them apart. I analyze situations and shit so my brain likes to fuck around. Today, this nigger suggested we use my analyzing for an unjust cause, so he made me study everything I analyzed. For example I was fucking around by bouncing my tennis ball with my racket, and then my brain decides to have me analyze and think about all of the potential math involved in calculating everything about hitting the tennis ball. I conceptualized third dimension, center of gravity, intended, quadratic motion. I don't understand this shit. I don't know what's going on.

So I was just thinking about all of the things we do subliminally. Like typing on my keyboard for example. It's amazing I know how to interface a computer based on keystrokes. It's kind of a ridiculous memory. Also like how we know to refresh a page. We just know to refresh it when the computer doesn't shit idk lol

Has anyone ever noticed the background music in shows and movies? Once you hear it and acknowledge its existence, it never leaves. My idea is to use this in tandem with Google Glass (if you don't know what I'm talking about go to Youtube) and earpieces and Glass will identify your current life situation and provide according music for every situation.

Some newer blimps have a [side-by-side looking configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lemvnight.jpg) which looks like it would add additional stability and lifting capability.

Our most advanced fighter, the F-22, weighs about 30 tons.

A dirigible could have a flight deck slung underneath, as long as those on the Nimitz/Ford class aircraft carriers. About a dozen fighters could be carried (more if smaller, lighter ones were used). Alternatively, it could carry tanks and ground vehicles (a dirigible can land about anywhere).

The Zeppelins, made 80 years ago, were able to go 85mph. Our most powerful aircraft carrier, Nimitz/Ford class, goes 35mph. Dirigibles can also go over land, and aren't as effected by weather (they can go up to and over 30,000 feet).

Besides carrying aircraft, they can also act as command posts; they can provide communications over a large area; you could outfit them with lots of cameras for battlefield intelligence gathering; they could carry a large radar dish, acting as AWACS.

The surface could be covered with solar panels, allowing an emergency means of controlling the craft, and reducing the need to run diesel generators (I don't need to tell you why you wouldn't want a nuclear reactor on one of these).

Dirigibles are mostly [immune to small arms fire.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#Safety) They fired thousands of rounds at a civilian model (no reinforcement or armor) - 2 hours later, it was still capable of landing with no difficulty. It can go high enough to be out of the range of anti-aircraft guns, and only has to deal with missiles. Heat-sinking missiles would be largely ineffective, especially if running on solar.

Cost is another plus. An aircraft carrier can cost $10 billion, and up to $500 million per year to operate. A dirigible would cost a fraction of that, and require a much smaller crew.

Might even be able to make it stealth. If non-metal composite materials are used for the dirigible's frame (like plastics or carbon-fiber, or even fiberglass) it greatly reduces the radar cross section. The surface could be coated (or made from) radar absorbent materials.

I think there is a difference between consciousness and experience. Consciousness is really just a stream of experiences. So what does it take so simulate ""experience""? It's a particular configuration of neurons communicating creating a state that causes an experience or consciousness. A split moment of experience really can't be described and broken down, it's a freeze frame or picture of consciousness. A picture that is really just a type of sensation that without prior sensation and future sensation makes no sense. 

Sorry for the ramble but what exactly makes up that smallest frame of sensation, say if you wanted to recreate it. Could you set up just the exact atoms needed to create it? Since the sensation of experience exists inside the brain, if you don't believe in a soul I guess, the really you'd just need to use the atoms and create that brain in that state. But I don't think the thing that causes it takes the whole brain. In fact to make a circuit of sorts that represents an experience probably wouldn't take that much. 

So with that in mind I think we could possibly be looking at the universe all wrong. To me it seems that it would be easier to create a type of collection of atoms that represents a single experience. There might just be one circuit and that is now. All the things in the past don't really exist and the future doesn't really exist. Now is just the one circuit configuration I'm experiencing as I write this. Or their could be every combination and they all exist at once. If this is the case then it would seem natural that the circuits would all be somehow linked together to create streams of consciousness.

Basically like a movie is made up of frames. Its like all the frames exist at the same time but some of them make more sense to go after another. 

Anyway theres a bunch more weirdness that could come out of something like that, it seems like the whole simulated world thing would make sense because you don't have to simulate the whole universe you just have to simulate experience, if you could create a machine that could configure some electrons for every possible combination then you'd have all consciousness."	t5_2qy0n	True

1341122157.0	vvbmx	The Turkolator. A self-basting turkey cooker.	iheartbaconsalt	10	0	2	"I usually keep a few turkeys in my big-ass freezer.  I like to cook at least one a month and sometimes a turkey breast here and there because I love turkey. 

Every time I get really baked (lol, turkey, baked, oh man) I think about turkey and ways to improve it.  I usually wrap turkeys in bacon which pretty much slowly bastes your turkey in bacon fat until it's all just a pool at the bottom of the pan.  

The Turkolator would be a roasting pan with a receptacle at the bottom where the juices and other liquids you want to baste the turkey with collect.  There would be some kind of pump with metal or possibly silicone tubes that would squirt the juices onto the turkey as it cooks automagically.    It could be butter, chili lime sauce, soy ginger garlic sauce, mango habanero sauce, or even a brown sugar and balsamic sauce!  The possibilities would be endless.  

The other way I see this is almost identical but the juices/sauce mix could be injected into the turkey AND spread over the top to make something even more awesome.  Since that hypospray was discussed recently on several sites, it would make it even MORE awesome by using tiny jets of sauce to get deeper and spread better. 

I thought about trying to build such a thing with a bunch of plastic tubing and an aquarium pump but that just wouldn't work in the oven.

At this time Aku reveals that his release was thanks to the magic poisons arrow (duh) which contained three things: Magic, Poison and fire taken from the *sun*. Then a bunch of other stuff happens and Aku is beaten and re-sealed. 

But, as we see at the beginning of the series Aku gets released because of an eclipse. A time where the sun's light is partially blocked and it makes a sort of 'dark-day' if you will.

""we are able to create primitive things. why couldn't a greater being have created us?""

now, in the advent of computers, humanity can see pretty clearly ""ah... it is not such a leap to presume that if we can make simulations, reality might well be a very advanced simulation."" the matrix was the movie that brought this idea to the mainstream (if pessimistically). but there is a lot of baggage with a lot of stupidity around religion, and if this is just a simulation then god is probably indifferent anyway. (it occurred to me that my view of god might be more nuanced than that of past generations; not because i'm smarter, but because i grew up in a world of [albeit primitive] simulations.) and regardless of whether you believe there's a god you should probably live as if there weren't, as a general rule. but sure, build out your gigantic monuments to him, who knows, he might ""do you a solid"" (in dennis rodman's terms).

this line of thinking could be used to justify a belief in the supernatural. one thing i notice when i'm high is just how *strange* the world is. and if this was a simulation, it was made (perhaps) by a programmer (or team of programmers), who could have added some ""easter eggs"", artfully designed to be untrackable by scientific methods.

Urizen23	8	0	0	"It seems the Tim &amp;amp; Eric skits can be divided up into different ""classifications"".

Well there's also another less-than-1-second close-up shot of Mr.Grello where he says ""I'm a demon"". If you watch all of those segmets wih that in mind, it means that his ""Father"" is Satan &amp; that his ""should be eaten raw"" comment is not out of place.

It made me realize that there are often muliple layers to T&amp;amp;E's comedy that aren't readily apparent when first watching the episode &amp;amp; the episodes are so schizophrenic in their editing, creating this web of interconnected media registers that are frequently nested within eah oher, so that more controversial social/political stuff can make it to air &amp;amp; then be put back together by those of us with the time &amp;amp; energy to reassemble it.

I came up with a really basic classification system, &amp;amp; it needs a lot of work, but I hink most of the broad categories are covered:

Shows: The show that is supposed to be recieving our full attention (e.g. Their ""straight-man"" segments)

Tapes: internally-consistent sequences intercut across a show or shows to contribute to the larger show (eg Brule's Rules; Uncle Muscles' hour, etc.)

Music videos: various music video collections &amp;amp; singers (e.g. ""when yoooouuu come over...."")

Sub-universes: series of tapes that all draw on the same background or universe, appear within each other, &amp;amp; share a common named character or base concept

Commercials: Various Cinco product ads &amp;amp; infomercials

Links: ideas or strange things that appear in multiple episodes or are used as ""links"" between otherwise entirely unrelated clips  (sfx conventions, transitions, etc) typically used to duct tape a show together, so to speak (e.g. that little weird bearded baby)

Absurdisms: the various things done just for the sake of it, to make a statement in the postmodern sense; what's left over after all other clips have been assigned to different categories.

Openings: different openings with what changes are inserted.

Wallbursters: intentionally poorly-cut or produced aspects of a show used to breach the verisimilitude of a segment, usually used in a ""show"" to draw attention to the absurdity of the situation.

Technical difficulties:  graphic overlays or simulated problemsdesigned to take you out of the show (eg vhs tracking adjustment, video skip/buffer, technical glitches, minimizing a popup window, &amp;amp;c.)

Greenbits: Tim &amp;amp; Eric talking to ""real people"" or otherwise involving others in the show without their knowledge.

Sincerity: tim&amp;amp;eric being serious/honest (eg ""thank you"" segment @ the end of one of their shows)"	t5_2qy0n	True

We are living in the thought construct of an entity of time dimensions."	picky62	11	2	3	"Hello fellow thinkers. I am steven pasqualoni, call me stu, an engineering stUdEnT from toronto. So, hoping you are familiar with, or have vaguely heard some shit about unified theories, 10-dinesional existence, the possibility/probability of everything in the world happening is in fact happening elsewhere in a different subset of our subspace yadayada. So. I am thinking of maybe a practical view of some features of this stuff. In our consciousness, in our brains there are always options, occuring at all times, which we weed out and select without even noticing. The fact that there are infinite options is 1-dimensional in the sense that there are a number of options - 1 to infinity. A straight lined list. These represent the possible paths in the random space that we can take. now, we have the ability to think of these options and make a selection, which when viewing the list of options - the 1-dimensional space, is a 2-DIMENSIONAL FEATURE (viewing the list, the 1-D line from an external reference point). This is proven in that our brains can think in 2-dimensions, we can picture 3-D objects, but the fact that they are still being ""pictured"" is in fact 2-dimensional. So, we are 3-dimensional entities who can develop 2-dimensional awareness. Perhaps this is a trend, and the 3-dimensional universe and all its workings are the thought construct of a 4-dimensional entity or essence, which would be time. We might be a thought construct of a time-entity."	t5_2qy0n	True

1370121005.0	1fheld	A general model of cosmology	vylasaven	9	1	0	"So this is an initial attempt at a new theory of physics. ;)

Maybe the reason the universe looks like it's expanding is that all the matter in the universe is essentially draining into black holes for the entire observable universe /and beyond/, and all of the change we see in the world and in the universe is the result of that process, but we can't see past the edge of the observable universe to be able to perceive the black holes over that edge, so it just looks like things are getting further away. 

Essentially, maybe there was no big bang, maybe just a starting distribution of homogeneously distributed spacetime fluid. And in that fluid, perturbations on a scale maybe we can't measure yet began to happen due to some quality of the fluid, or maybe some initial jarring motion that rippled space-time just enough to cause tiny three-dimensional ripples of force to go shooting in all directions due to the laws of the universe. Because of the (possibly variable in type) qualities of those ripples, they move through space-time fluid frictionlessly, but they also attract one another - they are like the bowling ball on a sheet of rubber, whereby two of them naturally fall together because they bend spacetime three-dimensionally wherever they are. Another analogy would be like a boat wake, where a jetski behind it will naturally fall into the dip in the water created by the boat's passage. These initial ripples may even be below the Planck scale where we cannot measure them, and they may be particles, or waves, or something else that only makes sense when assessed on its own scale. 

Anyway, these ripples attract each other according to gravity, and this is important, because there is a distribution (variety of sizes) in the size of individual ripples, presumably, just like when rain falls in a puddle and creates many ripples of varying sizes between where the raindrops land, except in three dimensions, so that the ripples can flow through space in any direction. These ripples tend to attract one another in predictable ways based on size and which direction they're going and how fast they're going, according to gravity. 

But because there is a huge diverse array of these ripples, they tend to attract one another in diverse, yet on a universal scale common, ways. So you end up with maybe a lot of stable particle pairs for the lowest common size at the start, where two of these ripples encounter each other and begin to orbit one another. But you also end up with binary systems, trinary systems, even huge complexes of carefully balanced, yet gravitically accurate functional systems of systems.

These systems of systems are what make up maybe even the building blocks of the building blocks of something like a lepton or boson. Such systems may even be recognizable as such by the way they disintegrate.

Note: ripples = waves = particles = discrete units of change in the universe

The reason the universe looks holographic is that there is a constant stream of these sub-sub-sub-subparticles still rippling around - cosmic background radiation - and popping ""virtual"" particle pairs ""into existence"" via Hawking Radiation. 

This would suggest the quantum world is just a shoddy measuring device seeing fluctuations that may be able to be inferred from data like electron orbit diagrams which plot out the probability that an electron will be at any given point at any given time.  After all, maybe if an electron is made up of dozens of other spinning, stable binary systems, maybe that could inform explanations of charge, or gravity, or magnetism. Maybe when these particle pairs ripple through the universe they leave sub-ripples, the effects of some of the particle pairs that for some reason cause a wobble, an imbalance that causes space to bend around the ensuring chaos of ripples all over the place.
Maybe this creates sub-ripples that can travel away from the electron but which still trace back to it, but on a scale we are not aware of, but which to the electron is noticeable.

Maybe those sub-ripples coming from binary and trinary systems spiral through space in a given direction and connect with other sub-ripples, which then link together, literally fall into each other, and then spiral in the same fashion as one another because they are literally causally linked, not spooky action at a distance.
 
Maybe there's a system that makes sense below our extended sight, which if accounted for and theorized correctly according to the universal laws of physics, totally explains quantum mechanics."	t5_2qy0n	True

1355049078.0	14jktn	The future of AI machine development and our future evolutionary stages. One and the same?	dgutty	9	3	16	"This is from a comment I left in another thread from a few days ago.

I've been thinking about AI a lot lately. I've thought about how it will affect our lives, and whether or not we should fear its development of self awareness for fear of our own safety. If it is self serving, as we might consider a future attribute of an AI, self aware, and occupies a mobile and dynamic frame, it may or may not consider us a threat to its well being. 

If it attacks us, and likely beats us, our species will be extinct. Though, what if the next stage of our evolution is simply the transference of our cognizance to another form of being: machine? If that's the case, we should inherently have the desire to pursue that stage without questioning the well being of human. 

Essentially, human is simply the vehicle that our cognizance has evolved into and occupied for this period of time; machine is simply our next stage. Additionally, in our AI machine stage of our evolution, we will constantly have micro evolutions similarly to our software on our computers having updated versions to download (i.e. OS X Mountain Lion, Windows 8, Chrome 2.4566372xxxxxx.9273832xxxx).

Eventually, I'd expect the peak of our evolution to be our removal from a physical vehicle, and the ascension into an interconnected unity of identities and knowledge and understanding. It will be orgasm in most pure and perfect form, infinitely through a medium we'll have ascended into from time.

So I was using my mflb on the roof of my house, watching the sunset, when I was struck with the idea that men are defined by their actions, by what they do.  To be a man is to act, to perform, to change, to work.  

I fall in and out of productive periods, mostly due to my on-again-off-again self-discipline.  Often, I will get on a 'roll' so to speak, only to have a moment of doubt that a life lived with a lot of self-discipline is too 'stone-age' or what have you (I live in a town without a lot of go-getters) and I will quit whatever goal/project/task I am doing and slack off for long stretches of time.  

Could this be because I wasn't just allowing myself to be who I am, which is a person who craves ""goal lists"" and productivity systems, and New Years Resolutions?  I think it very well might have been.  This is who I am.  I am a man and I get shit done.

Oh, and this is all partly as a result of a very serendipitous Youtube clip of Napoleon Hill (searched for 'discipline') who gave me goosebumps when he said,

All of a sudden I felt almost a vibration in my head, it was deep, almost like a voiceless voice, I could hear it, but not from my ears. Then another one came, this time lighter. Each time one was in place my feelings would change. It was like they were battling over dominance of my brain. I'm not sure if maybe this is the right and left brain or possible the more ancient animal part vs the more modern part. Anyways, when I heard the lighter one I would also hear a peaceful environment, running water and rustling leaves. The deeper one was almost painful in its sound. Eventually the lighter one won out and I felt like I had unlocked a new consciousness. I felt that I discovered the greatest secret of the universe, and that as always it was a matter of balance. This balance was between organics and minerals. In basic terms, man vs wild. One can never win, for that will be the end of them, it is a symbiotic relationship. I decided it was the most ancient war of all time. I then went on thinking and realized the Age of Aquarius is aligned with the Mayan 'apocalypse' could it be possible they were referencing the same thing?

Now here's my update to the idea, a treadmill that can sense directional changes in the player and rotate to accommodate these as well as grade changes. The player would wear sensors on his feet that would communicate to the treadmill. The game (or training simulator or exercise simulator) would be displayed on a helmet worn by the player, the scene would adjust to the movements of the head but you would have to actually turn your feet to start moving in a new direction. Accessories could be tailored to the specific application. The treadmill would also allow the player to ascend or descend hills. The treadmill would have to be able to adjust to various speeds as well as user jumps,  so im thinking a simple self-powered treadmill would be ideal, perhaps with varying degrees of mechanical assistance. Significant safety hurdles would have to be overcome, but just imagine how incredibly in shape young people would be with a truly interactive way to use the thousands of hours each year they spend gaming.

1332658133.0	rcg6d	War and Peace. Just My Take on Life.	marchwidth	8	1	3	"We have had wars throughout history. They always interrupt spans of peace. As humans we feel the need to stay largely focused on fighting. When peace becomes dull we create conflict purely for the sake of breaking up the monotony. Later we see that everyone dies young  and war is scary, so we begin to fix things. We fight wars for peace.


Wars are easy to instigate. Some words are said, or a simple misunderstanding and suddenly Armageddon is here full swing. Humans feel the need to protect their ability to get mad and fight over nothing.


What if Peace and War were reversed? I don't mean just the names. I mean what if Humanity lived in an almost constant state of Peace and we were always striving for War? You could argue that that's what we are doing already, but I mean on a more fundamental level. If the nature of humans was to constantly be in war with random bouts of peace.

There is killing and fighting all around and someone would say some polite words that diffuse the situation. Wars stop and people get along. They have fun, smile and the earth is beautiful. Humans become enlightened and set out to fix things. Fix things to the way they were before, because it scares them. Peace, we find, is a hell of a way to die. It takes decades to die a slow and painful death. Better to take a bullet to the brain and not feel it, than to while away with motor neurone disease and watch yourself die little by little.

Uh, Here Lies Anuthep Komolsingsakul.
He was a good person, and determined,
Even though we
Are not very sure what he was trying to do

Notice it and say STOP.
Don't necessary scream, just
say STOP.

Your writing has become quite weird, a bit conceited but alright in its own mission to sound unique.
In fact, this uniqueness is a fraud, and also a reality.
Nothing is new under the sunrise,
And no two things in the Universe are alike,
So you are both right and wrong at the same time.
Sink this in, then get stop getting obsessed over it and move on.

I am sitting here because I am contemplating myself sitting here contemplating myself and the universe that may or may not exist inside and outside myself. It's weird stuff, this existence thing, a subject I have been wondering about for, I don't know, MY WHOLE LIFE?

The fact that I am writing this gives me the thought that what the fuck is thought.

I'm feeling thoughts come and go in my head as I write this sentence. Completely aware of the effects of each one, and I'm obliged to say they come in wave. Maybe that last past wasn't completely true, but whatever is?

I'm not trying to make sense today. Because I am guessing, because all perception is gamble, and even the thought that all perception is a gamble is a gamble, that there is an unfamiliar sensation arising in me today. 

The rule from now on is that you are not able to go back and edit anything you have written. SO LETS GO

Get loose, the Nameless which by definition cannot be named but for reference I shall put here anyway. Don't take it so seriously.

There seem to be a certain thing compelling me to write these thoughts. I have no idea what it is, and where it come from, and I'm being meta about everything, even the thought that I'm thinking I'm being meta about being meta. Argh. 

What the thinker thinks, the prover proves.

The opposite of every truth is also true.

I'm going to write the truest thing I know.

Everything in this world that you do in the name of good,
is going to, at the same time, be a cause of many miseries,

The passing of a thought always bring tension, because
Every thought is tension, and tension is thought

I'm not quite yet convinced that thought is the cause of suffering,
but many of my mentors seem to think so, and so I am quite
EXPERIMENTING with it

Speaking of mentor, I find it troubling, the thought that Jae said,
when I was reading an Evernote page with a list of people I consider
INFLUENTIAL, and I'm paraphrasing and translating at the same time,
""Are those the people that are smart enough for you, the ones deserving of your time?""
The thought produced a tension within me, and in a baffled reflex I simply replied,
""Uh, no.""

Today again, I notice how Jae seemed to be hostile to the fact that I wasn't playing Portal 2,
even though I have downloaded it for over a week.

I have no idea why he would be troubled by such a thing, one of my immediate assumptions is that he's probably trying to prove something bad about me and in effect relatively
ELEVATE his status in the pact.

REFLECTING ON IT,
I find certain thoughts that arise with his words, and they relate to certain assumptions I have had about myself,
""I am selfish."" is definitely the first one that came to mind.

For a long time now I have thought of myself as a selfish creature.
I have left my family, and the business of my family, for something I'm not even sure about.

NOT BEING SURE is a bane to most people I know,
but it is a blessing to me, and a curse, depending on your location in spacetime,

Anyway, back to me being selfish.
I think a multitude of people would attest to that,
judging my behaviors,
with the eyes they have.

But eyes change,
and if there is one thing I want you to pay grave attention to,
is a line of thought by Alfred Korzybski, it says:

""The map is not the territory.""

I know you don't think of me as a wise man, or as someone worth taking seriously, for that matter,
but from my 23 years of experience in this world, I have found these six words to be my favorite thought:

The map is not the territory.

Abstract models that we make in our minds are not to be mistaken for reality.

One thing I find remarkable about human is that we are SIMULATORS.
And there are plasible theories that say we are also probably SIMULATIONS,
but I'm not going into that at the moment,

because the thing to note is that me make assumptions based on insufficient data,
that's what we do,
even though we are not even aware of it most of the time,
but you can be aware of this with ATTENTION.

At any given time, the body perceive an infinite amount of data,
but these don't all enter your consciousness,
in fact only small parts of it ever do.

What we have words for, are small,
compared to the vast landscape of perception.

Almost everyone I have found have bought into the philosophy of Aristotle,
a seamingly benile thought that have been a gripping hand thoughout the late human history. 

All of you are familiar with this kind of thinking. Philosophers call it Dualism. Zen Masters call it with their stick. 

It is the notion that WORDS are reality.
That everything must be something and not the others.
That either/or dichotomy.
The knife that has divided your world.
And brought so much suffering.

Just be aware that you are using the knife,
and every time you use words to understand things,
you DIVIDE them up and store them into different compartments of your brain
One says, ""preferred - get more""
The other says, ""BAD - AVOID, PUSH, GET AWAY FROM.""

Notice it and say,
STOP

Resistance is futile.

So you make your decisions based on a flawed model, what's the big deal, right?

That’s how rock, paper, scissors really works. Rock is (was) secluded, and felt alone, making him react to things somewhat violently. But paper became is friend and changed him, making him kinder and open up. Then, scissors killed paper. And in an act of revenge, rock kills scissors. But not like his normal killing. His face in the 3rd image says that. It’s more like rock’s one final act of vengeance. A “last mission,” if you will.

Could reddit as a collective, crowd sourcing community create a great song? So, here's my idea, for every component of a song, there is a thread that asks for artists in that genre to submit their submissions and as a collective, reddit votes on the one they think should be included in the song. So, starting with what music genre should we try and make? A hip hop song? A rock song? A pop song? A house with singer mix? Once that is selected ( lets use hip hop as an example of what is chosen) then the next thread would be hashing out what the plan would be eg Beats -&gt; chorus -&gt; rap verses -&gt; producer. Each component is submitted by redditors with their submissions voted on at each stage. So collectively, reddit would supply the music and the crowd feedback for a catchy tune. Do you think that would work? This is kinda of a social experiment with no end game other than could we create a great song? Thoughts? I've thought of a few challenges around how would you source the right groups? How long would you give for each part submission? How would you give the artists who submit an awesome part later in the game getting appropriate exposure compared to someone who submitted early and has been upvoted to the very top? Does anyone else think this would work? Care to help hash this put and sre if it's possible? Man that was a strong pb sandwich.	t5_2qy0n	True

You will receive pictures to post every week of your baby from pregnancy test results to birth.  After that your baby gets an FB account which you and your family and friends can interact with.  You will be able to continue generating photos of your child with huge selection of backgrounds, clipart objects, and integration into your own photos with a cardboard green-screen that you pose with for a good fit.  

Of course your child will randomly post about their favorite food, diapers, and anything else we can think of to generate ad revenue to pay for the whole thing.  When you sign up you enter a contract to not unfriend your baby until it's 18th birthday.

(x-post /r/linguistics)"	P0uncer	8	2	0	"In my few linguistics courses in college, I was taught that language is legitimate even if it's considered slang or dialect by some, and that standardized language is just a political game really. The language used by those in power typically becomes the standard. I find that I agree with this language ideology.

I just got into a discussion with a friend over the ""realness"" of the word ""chumbolone"". He had never heard the word before.  However, because ""chumbolone"" is actually used in spoken AND written language (I know one columnist in the Chicago Tribune uses it), I find that it should be thought of as a ""real"" word. The word's meaning should not be discounted, because it is regional dialect.

Even words that are only used in spoken language cannot be discounted. These words express unique ideas to those who use and hear them. Perhaps their lives are only short or maybe they become standardized and live on for generations...that's not the point.

I guess I just really don't like the idea of perpetuating ideologies of standardization. Instead, I support polylinguism, because the more languages and dialects we speak or understand, the more ways we have to look at, understand and describe the world around us.

This ""death"" might be characterized by the stifling of socially beneficial products for the purpose of current profitability (medicinal mj stifled by big pharma, for instance). Other characteristics might include the uprising of the working class, the literal dying state of the ruling class, and the throwing away of traditions.

From a Higelian Dialectic perspective, the wrestling of two systems is coming to a head, where a combination of the two will emerge. Arguably, that's what we might be seeing in the next 4-20 years. This combination will be the precursor to a socialist system, which will be the battleground for a communist system.

It's ridiculous. We *all* compare ourselves to others, even if we would rather regurgitate pithy folk wisdom. We love comparing everything we come across: we're obsessed with knowing which business was most successful, which political party most popular, or which brand most trusted. If you don't compare yourself to others, you'll never know where you stand: how far you've come, or how far you can go. 

Every time I get down on myself, a confidant inevitably tells me, ""well, you can't compare yourself to other people!"" Why not? I've learned a lot about myself by comparing myself to other people. I learned what qualities I lack, and wish to have; I learned about skills and talents I wanted to acquire; I learned about issues I would not have been interested in otherwise. By allowing me to see what I don't have, comparing myself to others has also allowed me to enrich my life. 

I don't think it's *comparing yourself* that's the problem. I think it's *grading yourself*. It's not evaluating yourself relative to another person. It's assigning an intrinsic, normative value to the evaluation. It's not saying, ""Jerry knows more words than I do."" It's saying, ""Jerry knows more words than I do, and therefore, I am an idiot."" An evaluation is just a piece of information. It isn't moral - it's just a resource, waiting to be used. And information about yourself can be used to build whatever you want: you can make goals, habits, and happy ambitions; or brow-beat yourself for being second to somebody.

So, from the time of cavemen to the present, if the same time period was taken from the present to the future, judging from what happened, would our bodies lag behind our advancement?

This would mean that if that happened today, fastfood would not be bad for us as we would adapt to the high fat and calories (carrying on with the example).

I kind of thought that the new kid was the kid who was like, ""Okay guys, let's stop playing Bangaas and Judges and fight this hard in real life!"" where Bangaas and Judges was the elaborate long running recess game they played after school. They had this elaborate fantasy, and even that one cool dad was even in on it as ""Head of the Judges!"" (but he was really supervising. That's why he called ""no long sticks today please!"")

But it was all a game and the main character was saying, ""Be this strong in real life!"" ""Stand up to your boss like you stood up to the Bangaa trio!"" ""Didn't it feel nice to trust me in the game? It's like that to trust people in real life!""

And so it's the story about a bunch of underprivileged but still very different kids and their teacher who learned what it was like to trust each other in game, then learned how to be strong for each other in real life. As they fought their villains in real life, those villains were manifested in the game. Then the new kid came into town and pretended he found the ~~Dungeons and Dragons~~ Bangaas and Judges book in the library, they all decided to play along, and now there's twenty of them playing their version of it which also involves three more DMs and judges for all of the ""fighting parts"". 

But then I remember that I haven't played FFTA in probably ten years, and that's a totally dismiss-able thought. But then I realized... You could have a video game that's heartwarming and teaches kids about personable relationships and being strong no matter your adversary by having a game that's basically FFTA where the ""Bangaas and Judges"" game portion was game and the side stories between the quests would have snippets of the character's real lives. NPCs could all be tag-a-longs or evil villains. Then they'd dust each other off and go back to their boring and powerless lives, but affecting new change in how they interacted with each other and how they changed what they could and adapted to what they couldn't.

And the player can make different conversation decisions in the IRL portion of the game which would affect whether ""Lucy wanted to play with them or if Lucy just wanted to be left alone to study and feel bad for herself // Lizzy wanted to fight along with the Bangaa Three and the hero, or if Lizzy just didn't really like fighting, thankyouverymuch."" And as the teacher tries to teach the kids though the lessons of that day's adventure, the teacher is sometimes surprised by the children's insight.

It's very heartwarming. Or cheezy? Someone let me know if this is heartwarming or cheezy.

What is it like to be blind and deaf from birth? When we are born we learn because we can see things and hear things. What if you couldn't see or hear? What would your mind be like?

I am not currently high, but I thought of this at [7]. I was laying on my couch after trying out my new bong and was just staring at the ceiling. You know when you are high and you don't have any visual stimulation? I believe visual stimulation is the only thing that keeps us focused because audio just turns into a sort of theme song/background music to a period of time. Anyway, I was spacing out hard, and I thought what if I hadn't learned any sort of language? Or seen anything? Ancient Philosophers learned things by observation. (example: Gravity). Then what would happen if I was born and had absolutely 0 knowledge. The only thing that I could do would be make noises (I wouldn't know I was making noises because I couldn't hear them) and I could feel pain or responses. 

It's like if you were put into a spaceship with no way of seeing what was outside and no gadgets to tell you. The only way you would know if you were about to hit something is if you hit something.

Don't fuck up too much. Get an education. Being smart will lead to success. And if we play our cards right and the timing lines up, we could be doing what we love every day... For money.

By opening an independent recreational marijuana dispensary, growing your own strains, mixing and matching to personalize your newly hatched trees. 

Find a strain you've created and fallen in love with, send it to a big recreational marijuana corporation... 

(which is sad to say, but they'll probably exist because the world's built on making money and solidifying a corporate economy) 

...hoping to expand. 

They try your strain, they like it, you score some dough and possibly a wicked new job creating strains for this company.

I was thinking of this while high and thought wouldn't it be awesome if they had that sort of documentary just for the cosmos? Like sure Discovery Channel has documentary-style TV shows, but they're rather shitty..it's sloppy CGI and recycling of the same visuals 10 times throughout the same episode, inter-cut with interviews from scientists and stock photos, and they usually explain a concept or phenomenon or the history of something or possible scenarios, and are not really about the cosmos itself.

I wanna see just images of the cosmos, of galaxies and stars just moving and colliding and doing what space objects do, without interruptions. I simply could have a soundtrack to it, something peaceful like classical music, or could potentially even have a voice over that explains whats going on a bit, like maybe tells you about the galaxy you are viewing, like how old it is and other stats and whatnot. This is different than Discovery Channel docs which use CGI to explain the stuff they're talking about, as this show would be focused on the footage of the cosmos and only use the voice over to provide insight into what you are viewing.

The footage could all be CGI, but quality CGI, not sloppily put together like the Discovery Channel, or it could be actual footage from telescopes and whatnot enhanced using CGI. Regardless, the footage would try to be as genuine as possible, and be beautiful and peaceful in ways that Planet Earth and other nature documentaries try to be.

Clarence (gay one) won the overall game (border) and gained a fuck ton of powerups along the way.  This is why he can die so often and float. Also he had to learn to sing well for some quest along the way and has become an expert.  Possibly the singing is the source of his power through spinning spells with his voice.  A single powerup he found and just fucks around now.  Who knows exactly.


Dave knows that it's just a game and a show.  That's why he does whatever he wants and just fucks everything up because it doesn't fucking matter. He knows it's a show and is just having fun because fuck it, world burn etc.


Jerry is a fucking pussy and closet homo because that was a thing in the 80's. This is so much a part of his focus that he's just a pussy and doesn't get it's a show, game to win, etc.


Mary is a hermaphrodite and so therefor hates everything to do with gender inequality since she's basically 1/2 man. Self hate etc. Also they so fervently avoids Jerry because they immediately knew he was gay.


Black Steve is actually pretty well explained actually.  He just went to Dartmouth, rode on a scholarship while there and made money by doing underground fighting.  He also knows all the languages because they would go to those countries to fight.  Or the plot explained reasons of minoring in Japaneese and spending a semester in (I forget which country) but learned conversational airabic. (Khakistan?). He's kinda set on character background.


Dean is a kid with a disease that requires them to be in a coma. So their wish is to have a big strong body.  Their consciousness is implanted in the body and they just enjoy themselves. It's just a shame that they were severely mentally handicapped, so that's why he's so retarded.

Larrity is the simple steriotypical character that always follows their dominant character trait (almost every show has one i.e. Barney Stinson from HIMYM).  This is probable from him getting butt hole cancer and developing other, more positive traits. 

Clare is just a really stupid bimbo and may be a real person like dave, but is just too damn stupid to realize that she's in the game/show etc.


Benny a midget actor that is transfered into a kid body for the show/game.  Kinda along the lines of Dean, but for the show not for a wish of a coma patient.


Todd is the time period character that's the extreme of their stereotype.  Kinda like Mr. Larrity but instead of being a deadly sin, it's a nerd.  The ultimate beta, fat, lives at home, geek, roleplays, fantasy stuff, etc.

Our existence is based in quantum mechanics (including quantum gravity, which is still unconfirmed mathematically) and Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The marriage of those two ideas explains mathematically (which is the way we interpret the nature of our universe) how and why we exist, but they don't explain it at the same time. That's the nature of our existence. At every infinitesimally small measure of time, a thing both happens and doesn't happen simultaneously, exponentially stemming that same possibility and impossibility for a different context.

The difficulty with this marriage theory is that it never arrives at a final conclusion, only an ancestor of all of the current consequential occurrences, which is the ancestor of all of those consequential occurrences, which is the ancestor of all of those consequential occurrences, and so on for eternity.

Therefore, with all of that said, what you might be reading if you stuck with me, is both real and not real. And what I'm now typing is both real and unreal. All at the same time. There is no origin, and yet, there is an origin, all at the same time. And yet, there is both no origin and an origin of that origin and of that origin and of that origin for both eternity and lack of the existence of time.

Shit, I think I might be schizophrenic in this reality, though it might just be my mind going into a deeper reality. What if the crazy people are just the only ones who have understood the absolute truth of this reality? What if they've left this reality for the next one closer to true origin? That would mean we're the crazy ones. This is never going to end in my mind in this reality. I'm trapped in here. I want to transcend. I exist in the wrong reality.

Let's face it, at some point in our lives, we've all been afraid to die. But why's that? Whether its because you're not sure if you will have an afterlife or because you simply don't want to leave this life yet, we've all been there.

However, both scientifically and philosophically, you are--we are all immortal.

Think about it. When you die, either your body will become a part of the earth...consumed yet, regardless, a form of energy... or a part of wherever else you may have your ashes sent. Either way, your body becomes an energy source for the universe as it is consumed, and you become the earth or space if you're Carl Sagan but regardless, you will always be some form of SOMETHING in the universe. you, me, and everyone else. 

Philosophically think about it. Who are the most important people in your life? Your spouse? Your family? Your friends? All of them would, will remember you...and that is such a grand power that I don't think should ever be taken for granted. And depending on who you are, you could be talked about for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years to come! 

The point is, live your life lovingly and happily, and do your best to leave a powerful memory of happiness, true happiness, in your wake, as though you were a boat on a sea of memories. You will always be something to someone, something to a place, and something to the universe. 

You are immortal."	t5_2qy0n	True
1376030569.0	1k0gdt	Circuits analogy [7]	xmclark	4	1	2	"Forgive me I am on my phone. 

I aspire to be an EE instructor sometime in my life. I enjoy tutoring electric circuits and think about analogies for people to use in conceptual understanding of the various topics like voltage, current, signals, etc.. 

A little backgfound: in fluids, we say loosely that high pressure air flows low pressure air. This is an analogy to voltage which is a difference in potential energy. Pressure is voltage and air current is electric current in the analogy.

More to know: The body breathes air through the lungs. To inhale the lungs expand to make the lungs a lower pressure than the air outside. With a certain reference, this causes a negative diff in air pressure, or inverse air pressure...basically sucking in. The lungs contract to make their pressure lower than the outside air, which causes a positive diff in pressure, blowing out. 

The function of an ideal voltage source is to maintain a certain voltage at all times and allow whatever current necessary. The human body can control pressure and allows whatever air flow. So in technical terms, the lungs are a ""pressure source."" And even more specific is that it is a ""mind-controlled pressure source"" because it does whatever ones brain tells it (low/high pressure).  The lungs permit whatever air current the body requires to hold a voltage.

I think I am missing something crucial about this analogy...and I am obviously skipping some other cases like when closing the mouth.

1353677549.0	13nzve	Can you answer the Riddle of the All Riddles?	Phil-osopher	10	8	14	"If you're into philosophy and science, this could blow your mind. If you're not, it will probably bore you.

This riddle has a bit of a story to introduce it, see if you can find the answer!

John is a skeptic. He believes neither in God, nor that science can either prove or disprove God. He believes wholeheartedly though, that there is a higher truth; he does not label himself an Agnostic. Above all, John is a seeker of enlightenment.

One night, a man comes to John in his dreams and tells him, ""Imagine that your entire consciousness - your awareness of yourself and the world around you - is in this box,"" and pulls out a small, jet black, palm-sized box. Upon trying to imagine this bizarre scenario, John dreams that he exists only in that small, confined space within the box. Yet, while inside it, the darkness is so confounding, so infinite, that he realizes how his perception of the world is so miniscule compared to the universe!

Suddenly, still in his dream, John feels a presence enter his box. In essence, it pervades his consciousness. John turns and sees him, clear as day in the infinite darkness of the box, but cannot identify him. He wakes from his dream, still having not identified who, or what, the figure in the box is.

The dream recurs nightly for months, and John, feeling he can no longer take not knowing, decides to go to a psychiatrist to work out his dreams. While in the shrink's waiting room, a priest sits down next to John. They engage in conversation, and the priest introduces himself as Father Charles. He asks John, ""So why are you here today?"" John tells him about his dreams, how they have been recurring, and the unidentifiable figure who pervades his very consciousness. He also tells him about how he seeks answers, to the universe, to his existence, to everything. ""Wow, that's quite intriguing,"" replies Father Charles, ""Have you ever thought, perhaps, that this figure in your dreams is God, and you are simply to come to this realization?"" John rises, thanks the priest, and leaves the psychiatrists office.

Later that night, in his dream, John sees the figure, but now he knows that it is God. When he wakes up in the morning he sits for a long while and ponders, ""How can God's entire infinite, all-knowing consciousness be encased in such a finite space like that box??"" Then it hit him - the answer. Suddenly, John believes in God. He goes to church and lives his life in the name of Jesus.

OKAY GUYS! Now, I'm not a strong believer in God, nor am I an atheist, but I thought this up while flying highhh and it really got me thinking.

So think of the question like this: If everything you knew existed in a small box, and one of those things was God, would the universe implode or something? Is that even possible? With ""God"" being so infinite, how can he exist in the box?

With as many people as there are looking at the moon, someone will eventually notice something glittering in the (reflected) sunlight.  If it makes the news, lay low.

This thought would make more sense to a high person... Which I am. High. High as high. 

If someone touches you, the touch isn't experienced in your hand, it's experienced in your mind, but your mind associates the touch with your hand, so that's where you *believe* you're feeling it.

This website combines the democratic and community-driven components of reddit with a ""programmer's exchange"" of sorts. Users submit pieces of code organized by projects by scope in exchange for a karma equivalent.

So, for example, code could be catagorized like so:

*A tool is a small piece of code, usually less than ten lines. These are usually to be used for a very simple function or as a piece of a larger project.

*A widget is slightly larger and usually contains several basic components but not a lot of complexity. A clock app, a small program that converts an RSS stock ticker to visual information, or a patch to an existing piece of code qualify as widgets.

*An object represents a middle point being a decent portion of a larger work (about half) or a modular system that interacts with a larger piece of code. An object could be a large plugin that does a variety of things, a suite for a set of office-type tools; this is a program that performs several complex functions but isn't a completed project.

*A project is the largest singular piece of code and consists of the creation of a small but full-featured program (such as Notepad, Calculator, or a torrent tracker). These will usually go through at least a few development cycles and quite a bit of testing.

Obviously, there will be a seperation of one time and periodic coding; the later for constant content updates or frequent support/patching.

Finally, once submitted, other users evaluate and test, using a democratic system like karma to build a consensus on the best code, in general.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. It was with words that the Universe was created. With words, that Man took the world in his own hand and made himself understand that Word is the One True God. For without Word what would be of these creation myths and fables that we hear and tell and live by, the dialectics that govern our behaviors, the very fabric of our thoughts, our laws, our reasoning? Of course they would cease to exist. They cannot exist without words. Many people would clinch at the idea of trying this, to go back to the state of thoughtlessness, because something tells them it is pointless and stupid and maybe even dangerous to be free from thoughts. But what is the thing that is telling them this? One can hardly see the territory while staring at the map.

If the United States economy ever collapsed and took the federal government with it, our economy would certainly plunge as well, though who's to say we wouldn't end up with much more than a severe depression. Anyway:

Biggest concern if the United States was divided into rival states or territorial factions would be a rogue faction launching an attack on Canada. Maybe they want to invade, maybe they just want to get back at us for allying with their rival, whatever, if one of those elements decided to, they could likely take us down. Unless it's the Sovereign Free State of Vermont we're talking about, a reasonably coordinated effort by a faction that obtains control over sufficient U.S. military resources and technology could probably wipe out our military, if they weren't more occupied taking down their neighbours. All that to say, I have an interest in this!

The US military needs to develop some kind of a ""kill switch"" plan that would allow large segments of their more powerful equipment to be easily neutralized in the event of an irreversible government collapse. The purpose would be to prevent a factional war from breaking out with such ferocity (cities levelled, etc) that Americans as a people and culture are eliminated.  At the end of the day, America is bigger than just its government and the state is only there to protect and foster the people and the nation.

Anyway, if the military could use some technological means of preventing the destruction of Americans (and likewise us Canadians!) from happening by developing a ""kill switch"" that could be activated by an order from the president (whoever in the line of succession that happened to be!) and would result in the disabling of key aspects of military technology, that would be good.

Would be bad, also, if a US enemy could use that before a government collapse too, though! But if they could develop something safe (maybe relayed instructions through trusted officials or something)...that would be good!"	t5_2qy0n	True

I know this sounds a bit extreme, but bear with me here.. I've spoken to a few individuals who claim that while under the influence of intense doses of DMT they have experienced a ""rebirth"" effect in which after traveling very far into the DMT-universe they undergo the process of death, so far as one can interpret an organic process attributed to this fatal totality, and then find themselves being reassembled and reborn into a totally new state of being until eventually catching up to their waking perception. 

The most profound encounter I had with someone who had experienced this was a girl who said, ""[After taking more DMT than usual] I died, and eventually found myself back in my body."" From what I gather.. she found it to be fairly traumatic, and even said it changed her on many levels.

I wonder.. if this could possibly be interpreted as a form of reincarnation for the waking mind. If you delve farther away from the logical dimension, and closer to the spiritual dimension.. is it possible that my consciousness can be washed clean? Tabula Rasa. Upon re-entry into the waking perception would one find themselves more prone to forming new ideals and perceptions, essentially a new personality all together? 

Food for thought, now I need food from forming all this thought.

TL;DR:  I met a girl who experienced death and rebirth while under the influence of DMT.. Led me to a thought process regarding reincarnation.

1356140712.0	159cse	The Fourth Dimension	enerkachoo	3	2	3	"Consider this:

.

We do not live in a 3D world, of just length, width, and depth. There is a fourth dimension, and that dimension is **time**. You're probably thinking I'm crazy, but hold on. There's some logic behind this.

.

Picture a zero-dimensional object, or as they call it in geometry, a point. It has no length, width, or height.

.

Now make it one-dimensional object, which is a line segment. Along that line segment, you can define any spot as a point. 

.

Give it some sides to make it a square. Now it is two-dimensional. You can make a cross section of the square, which will be a line segment.

.

Give it a third dimension to make it a cube. You'll notice that both of the previous dimensions are affected by this change. You can make a two-dimensional cross section anywhere in this cube.

.

This is where it gets tricky. Try adding another dimension that will affect the three previous dimensions; one that you could make a three-dimensional cross section of. Can you do it? Think hard.

.

Here's your answer: place the cube in motion. The cube (all three dimensions of it) moves a certain distance over *time*. A three-dimensional cross section of this can be conceptualized by imagining the cube stopped, in one of the places in its path of motion. In this 3D cross section, time is not relevant.

.

**WE NEED TO GO DEEPER:** Time can also apply to a 2-dimensional object. Picture that square moving in the plane. All that matters in this scenario is length, width, and time. Now, take a photo of this. In fact, take a photo of the cube every one-hundredth of a second, making sure the camera is pointed in the same direction each time. Place all of these photos on top of each other, and you get a flipbook. A 3-dimensional flipbook. **WHAT??** There's no height involved in the square's motion, only length and width! What is this third dimension?? Well, your third dimension here is **time**. The thickness (or depth) of each photo is a representation of the .01 seconds that passed by. Each photo is a two-dimensional cross section of that three-dimensional stack.

.

This explains the motion aspect of physics. In physics, velocity (a vector seen in a three-dimensional cross section of time) needs to be defined by using the vertical-and-horizontal component (Z-axis), the left-and-right component (X-axis), and the back-and-forth component (Y-axis). 

.

I could add more, but I'm afraid this might already be too long for anyone to read in one sitting.

**TL;DR** read the damn text, it took forever to type and it sounds crazy if I try to sum it up.
