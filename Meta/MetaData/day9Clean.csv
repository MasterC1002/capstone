I don't want to get too specific, as I would like myself to remain somewhat anonymous on reddit, but I've suffered a lot throughout my life for someone as young as me. I'm talking violence in the household from a young age, broken family, severe drug problems..you name it, I've probably experienced some form of it.

Despite that, I don't let my problems define me and I'm a pretty cheerful, happy, well-rounded person. Even though I don't play StarCraft anymore (no means to, as soon as I have them I will) I thank Day9 every day for this. Finding his videos a few years back when I was at my worst probably not only saved my life but allowed me to enjoy it. His attitude rubbed off on me. I wanted to be that happy. My goal in life became ""be 1/10 as awesome as Day9."" Anyway, I e-mailed him about all this, despite some misgivings telling me ""it's 5am! You're making a bad decision! You'll seem creepy!"" I'm so glad I did. 

He actually responded very promptly. This was actually about a year ago, and I still read the message sometimes when I'm feeling down. I decided to share this with reddit today because even though it's a very response, it touched my heart so much. I actually cried. I was shocked that he actually replied, and how much he cared for a random fan...he is one of the heroes that isn't disappointing when you finally get to contact them. I hope it helps someone else out there. I think he gives great advice that can help anyone at any stage in their life. It seems obvious, but he made me actually listen.

Anyway, I would keep ranting about how great he is, but there is pizza. Day9, if any chance you ever read this, thank you so so much for helping me through my terrible high school years, when I had no freedom to leave the bad situation I was in. I'm so much better now and a lot of it is thanks to you. Here was his response: 

Hey -name taken out for obvious reasons-:

Not creepy at all!

What an incredible, articulate email!  You are such a great writer!

We read your email to Day and all talked for a while about how hard it is to grow up.  I mean really hard.  We've all struggled, including Day--especially in high school.  In fact, Day got completely emotional when we read him what you wrote.

Day says to tell you that he totally relates.  Personally, he just decided to like himself and make his own happy place in his head and in his world and refuse to let anyone tell him he was nerdy or stupid for doing that.  He does not tolerate negative, destructive behavior.  He works hard to surround himself with happy, funny people.  He asks you to remember to play.  A lot.  And laugh.  A lot.  And not to take life too seriously.  It is all gonna be great.  Just hang in there.  Good times directly ahead.  He promises.

He has to go on State of the Game now so he can't say more, but he will be thinking about you.  In fact, if he sobs on air, you will know it is your fault.  ;p

And keep watching the Daily!  It is audience like you that make the hard work worthwhile!

 Watching the archive of Daily's is the only thing that has gotten me through the events of this last year: my slip back into depression, the breakdown of my parent's relationship and my journey from straight 'A' student, applying to University, to a drop out having to repeat a year. 


For much of the past year the only reason I could find to get out of bed would be to check the archive, as I live in the UK, to see if the previous nights daily had been uploaded. The strange thing is, to begin with I didn't even enjoy playing Starcraft 2 online and yet watching the Daily and listening to Day[9]'s commentary was one of the only things that brought me any joy and allowed me to relax. 

Whilst watching the Daily, Funday Mondays in particular, I found myself actually laughing, for the first time in months. Whether It was laughing at one of the stories about Felicity or at his Mutalisk impressions. 

 I can honestly say that if I had not found the Daily, I don't think I would be alive right now. No matter how low I felt, no matter how bad of a day I was having, Day[9], through the Daily, never failed to make me laugh and feel just a little bit happier. 

I don't think I can ever really put into words how grateful I am that I found the Daily and that Day[9] does the daily. 

Thank you Sean, you really are an amazing person :)

1344480380.0	xx2ym	Help Day9 with his computer troubles [from a computer tech's perspective].  		175	22	46	"Day9: I've seen that you have had a ton of problems with your computer.  I'd like to help you, but its hard to get a hold of you... So I was hoping that maybe this message could reach Day9 so that future dailies will be uninterrupted.  

Currently, I think your computer is suffering from two problems:

* 1) The kernel failure is probably from your graphics card(s) overheating.  You already did the basic troubleshooting, I bet that its just overheating and causing a overheating protection fault.  

* 2) The general performance issues you have regularly faced for years should be fixed by implementing several identical high performance SSD hard drives in a RAID 10 [or try a RAID 0+1] configuration [the number of drives to be left up to your pocketbook, but they must be an even number and should be identical].  With a hardware raid controller and some good drives, your performance issues should disappear.  

**Fellow reddit trollers! Please upvote this [it is a self-post so I don't care about karma... I mean... who actually cares about karma anyway...] to increase the chances of Day9 actually seeing this.  He has been having tons of trouble... and I only want to help him out.**  

Solutions (keep in mind I know nothing about your computer - you'll have to custom tailor this for your particular build): 

* 1) The solution to this problem really depends on how much $[J] you're willing to spend.  You could troubleshoot the issue by checking your video card software to see if it has a temperature readout - if it does not, then you could install one - or just open up your case and point a high powered fan directly in it.  

If your graphics card is getting close to 90 c, you really should get some better cooling on it [optimal temperature is below 70c].  If you already have good circulation, [maybe getting something directly on your graphics card would help.](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186055) If you want to guarantee you never have a cooling problem again, [this guy shows a pretty nice liquid kit](http://youtu.be/gdaGDH-or-Q?t=33s).  I have done a few liquid cooling set ups and they can be cheap (less than $300) but cooling is extremely important so you shouldn't cheap out on it.  

* 2) I've watched your live stream quite often.  I don't think the stuttering that we see most often has to do with your internet connection.  I think it has to do with the most likely bottleneck in a computer, the hard drive.  Your computer is trying to encode your video at the same time as access data and trying to stream that data - so it lags at your bottleneck.  

I think if you implemented 4 high performance SSDs in a RAID 10 [or if you're feeling frisky, get into a 0+1; 2 sets of 2 drives - each individual set in raid 1, and the set of two sets in raid 0] with a [hardware raid controller](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816115029), you would lose those stuttering problems.  

Update: Sean has [replaced his graphics card.](https://twitter.com/day9tv/status/233400776268054528) I have no doubt that will solve the problem in the short term - but I strongly recommend monitoring that new card's temperature as the overheating problem is probably systemic (you could have poor circulation inside the case).  

Good luck with the new graphics card!  I still strongly recommend implementing at least a 4 drive RAID 10!

**Update 2**: I wanted to point out to everyone who is bringing up the important issue of cost, Sean said, tonight, that he keeps a backup of just about every part in the computer... Cost is obviously not the issue... This is common for this kind of user.  

Now if he would just read this and do some 4x SSDs in Raid 10 he'd lose that stuttering and install a liquid cooling kit to avoid a repeat of yesterday.  "	t5_2rvng	True

It has, unfortunately, been several months and I am sad that it has not happened. Perhaps it's still in the works, but I figure it can't hurt to see if it can be backed by Reddit.


In any case, here is my idea:


The topic for this particular Funday Monday would be to submit games wherein you, the viewers/players, are attempting to fulfill as many previous Funday Monday topics in a single game as possible. You can be any race, in any type of game (1v1, 2v2, FFA, etc), but you must fulfill at LEAST two previous Funday Monday restrictions in the same game (for example, Building Queens at all times with Spine Crawler attacks). 


The challenge is to see who can come up with the most/craziest combinations of restrictions. This is our chance to REALLY show DayJ how creative we can be, and I think the games submitted could be absolutely insanely awesome to watch.


I have actually created an [Excel spreadsheet](http://www.filesend.net/download.php?f=7cade116869999a448512ab3fa28856b) detailing all possible previous Funday Monday topics (up through episode 479, currently, and I'll update it with the others soon) categorized by both race and game type so you can easily isolate topics you want to try and that might work together. For example, you couldn't do Monobattles and worst 2v2 partners of all time simultaneously.


TL;DR I've got a cool idea where we try to do as many previous Fundays as possible in a single game. Help me make it a reality.


Thanks in advance for your feedback. Only constructive things can come of posting on reddit, right? ;)

Edit: For those incapable of using Excel (due to whatever reason) I have created the updated version as a Google docs spreadsheet. It can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ajo-dWOsYn9TdG9xV0ZnWEhIMTBYTXlBYTloN0xuMmc&amp;output=html)."	t5_2rvng	True

Mr j,

More than once you've inspired me to chase the things in life we think are out of reach. In interviews and junk like that, I get an aire of invincibility from you that I sorta fed off of. Not to mention you've made me cry on at least 2 occassions on the daily. 

We met once at NASL and I have a picture to commemorate the joyous occasion. The line was a mile long but you were nice enough to hold a conversation with me where you asked ""are you gonna have kids?"" and I said ""I hope so!"" and you said ""make them play games."" Well what I didn't tell you is that I had one of the rarest diseases known to man. Instead of having kids I wrote a book, that I won't advertise here. It does mention gaming in a few chapters, but it's mainly me finally doing something without permission. Thanks for the inspiration, althouh i'm sure you get that a lot.

Thoughts? I know he said he would do it in time, but Monday just seems like the perfect time to do this.

On November 26th 2011, [Izzak](http://www.reddit.com/user/izzak) and I (Kitty) played a 2v2 for Funday Monday: Worst Partner of All Time ...

We had so much fun and we submitted our replay, hoping to be chosen... and that happened! :D

I was in front of the screen, watching the pre-daily (your music is so good! :D ) and I was thinking to myself that it would be great if you would have chosen our replay...Then, the daily started and I couldn't stop laughing because that was so funny (those 6 pools cracked me up so much! XD )

And then, you started reading the email Izzak sent to you...! OMG!

""Day9 chose our replay!!!"" I screamed so loud so everybody in here would hear me! Izzak, who was watching the daily in his apartment (the floor above mine) ran down the stairs, followed by his roommate and my boyfriend.

They all sat in the living room with me and watched the replay as you were commenting it.

I was shocked! I was smiling, but I couldn't talk. I was staring at you, on the screen, and all I was hearing was you saying my name! Then, my sanity went back slowly and I promised myself I would become better so you would be proud of me!

I followed your advice and I played StarCraft2 after the daily (a few 4v4 with Izzak and two friends of mine)!

My friends suggested me to ask you if you would agree to play a 2v2 with me so you could teach me how to be a better gamer! :)

It would truly be an honor if you would agree playing with me! :D

Thanks again so much for the joy you brought to our house and to my heart tonight! &lt;3

Your biggest fan,

Caroline aka Kitty"	t5_2rvng	True

- Dude, we should totally make up a dating game version.
- Awesome! I already have the first one...

To make a long story short. The pebble started an avalanche and here are the results:

Introducing; The Day[9] Dating Game.




It is here to help all of you nerd ballers to get friskey with ze ladies. gl hf gg

The Day[9] Dating game 1.0

(thanks for all the inspiration Sean)

Ground rules:

* Never give up, never surrender
* FOR UNIDEN
* The relationship between a boy and a girl will always, no matter the patch, be imbalanced
* A girl who sleeps around is a ”carrier”. Don't be a fool, wrap your tool
* The art of finding a target is called scouting
* Don't ever become a stalker
* If she suspects that you are stalking her, just blink away. Shhhh, she'll never be sure
* Think of any ladies dad as a reaper. He may seem fragile, but he'll jump out of nowhere and shoot you in the face
* Refer to her sister as your natural expansion
* The speed upgrade is a plus when your targets boyfriend arrives
* The speed upgrade is a plus when you probe an allies natural
* A guy who brings his girlfriend to guys-night out has been subjected to neural parasite. Do your best to get the infestor to leave without getting your ally into trouble. Eliminate the infestor from the equation.


Things to do on a date:

* Everytime she takes a sip of water you must slurp your own drool
* Sneak Yoda into the conversation
* Refer to your home as ”the lost temple”
* In case your home is messy, it will be referred to as ”the shatered temple” instead
* Claim that you can't pick up the whole bill because you're awesome at macro and you never have any money left over
* Mention your ex girlfriend Sarah Carrigan atleast once. This lets her know that youre not a total looser (right...)
* When you're full, refer to it as being supply blocked
* When discussing art, mention your Mengsk statue. The ladies love them that culture
* Tell a heartfelt story about a cousin that was addicted to stim. Chicks dig a sensitive guy
* Tell her that you had a bejujular time

If things are going well, move on into sexytalk:

* Tell her that your dream car is a blue flame hellion
* Tell her that she's hotter than a blue flame hellion and that you'd love to ride with her
* Use the word Cattle Bruiser when you're talking about you penis

Closing the deal:

* ”Want to come over and see my xel'naga tower” is always a good pick up line to close the deal.
* The first act of sexual intimacy is called probing
* Don't ever rush to second base
* If her ramp is force fielded you have two choises. 1) just give it some time. 2) crush it with your colossus
* ”Lining them up” must be your facebook status after two or more concecutive wins at the dating game ladder
* Should we go back to my command centre or your nexus?
* When penetration finally occurs, you must utter the phrase ”metamorphosis is complete”

If and when you're out of the dating game:

* A sign that you are in a comfortable relationship is when you start referring to taking a dump as doing a Thor drop
* Sing her the baneling song
* The immortal dance is the only dance you will perform at your wedding, danced to the baneling song, or not at all
* A womans womb is not a hatchery, but almost...think about it.
* Always stay positive to beeing dumped like a boar

Avoid if possible:

* Don't spew your creep just because you see a girls nipple
* If you hug a girl, don't run, it considered bad manners
* Don't call all girls Felicity, it might work sometimes but don't count on it
* Trumpets

Kind regards

---------
_As much as I can understand that people might need to have their Day[9] fix on many aspects of their lives, I have to let this out: give the man a break! This concerns so many aspects of his life, so I’ll just list a few of them that appear to me to be more obvious.


_First of all, remember that Day[9] has a life. That may sound quite obvious, but for those who may stick to the idea that he is a puppet, please accept that he may do things on his own, that sometimes he may want to have some times for himself and that, it may imply that he won’t cast an event. Don’t get me wrong, I love when Day[9] casts and I would even say that it is the major reason for me to watch an event!


_However, I don’t understand that people jump out of their shoes when he doesn’t appear at an event. Moreover, I sometimes read comments that are quite disturbing, like if Day[9] owes something to those who wrote them. Day[9] doesn’t owe anything to any of us. He does what he does because he loves it and because he feels like it. We and I all know that he loves e-Sports but if, for any kind of reasons, he would quit doing either his dailies or any sort of casts, no one would have a thing to say about that. No one would have that right. Moreover, no one would have the right to ask for a reason why he would do that.


_In the same way, that also applies to him returning to pro-gaming or streaming his ladder games. I would love to watch him play either as a pro again or watch him play on stream (ladder or custom games), but I would never ask him to do so, because I know that he would feel pressure from that request. And that goes to all of you asking over and over again those sorts of things. Day[9] is too nice to say that he might feel pressure from those requests but take a minute and imagine yourself in his shoes. How would you feel in the same situation?


_One more thing… Stop asking for his salary. Please. Just stop. How much he earns from those ads or how much he makes for doing a cast in an event is none your business! At all! If he ever wanted you to know how he earns in a year, he would certainly have said it before.

I'm a Plat Terran that started down in Bronze when SC2 came out and I have been watching Day's videos religiously to help me improve. He is by far the single most influential person that changed my game and I feel as though there are specific episodes that helped me improve. I took all of those episodes and ordered them into a neat little playlist for your consumption. I hope you guys like it.

This is sort of the culmination and story behind a lot of the comments and stuff I've made lately. I know it has been done before, and truthfully I kind of hope it will be done again, but I'm gonna share with you all my thoughts on Day9 and my small story of how I ended up where I am now.

How did I get started with Starcraft?  How did I hear about Day9?  Christmas 2010, I really wanted Starcraft 2.  I didn't know shit about it.  I couldn’t have told you the names of the three races.  I was what you would call a complete noobie.  I had heard about how huge it was in Korea, but I had no grasp of anything beyond that.

I played through the campaign, and of course I thought I was the shit at Terran (really Terran it up :P).  I was eager, after besting the campaign on normal difficulty, to start my adventure into ranked.  I'll have you know, I went straight into my ranked 1v1 placement matches, because practice league sounded boring, and I didn't need 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 to prove my worth.

My first game?  I was probably finishing up my barracks when a handful of reapers jumped over the wall into my base and started ripping apart my SCVs before I knew what to do with them.  I was freaking out.  My 30 APM to make workers and build a barracks was already too much for me, and now I had these units, that I had honestly only used in one mission in the campaign, completely murdering me.  I'm pretty sure I cried a bit, I felt so awful.  The other guy kind of realized what was going on, and was really nice though, and apologized for doing such a cheesy build.  

I kept playing, and by my 5th placement match I was actually able to beat the other player by outranging his cannons with siege tanks!  I was placed bronze, but I wasn't giving up! A few games later, I had a pretty rough loss again, and afterwards the other player suggested I check out some videos to get a better grasp on the game.  He recommended HD, Husky, and Day9.  I subscribed to all of them on youtube, and started watching and learning, and while HD and Husky are awesome, Day9 completely blew me away!  Noobie Tuesdays were a godsend, and Funday Mondays, which were still pretty new at that point and really fun/ interesting.

Before getting too personal, I'd like to start with some of my thoughts on what makes Sean such a popular figure in the Starcraft 2 scene.  

Sean's level of fame hasn't changed who he is.  He is a regular person still like all of his viewers.  He gets it.  And his imperfections, while possibly detracting from his ""professionalism,"" help him earn the respect of his viewers.  As was part of his intention from the beginning, the chat/ chat involvement really helps to create and foster a sense of community.  It's kind of like sitting there on a giant sofa with thousands of friends all watching along :3

I think a lot of people don't realize the mental level that Sean must have regarding the game.  Knowing the game is just as much part of his job as it is part of a current Pro's job.  Years being a competitor at Brood War helped him develop and understand the competitive mindset behind a game like that.  I will hear people complaining that he can't possibly know the game at the same level as a pro player, and truthfully, I think in a lot of ways this is bullshit.

This culmination of Sean as a person, unafraid to joke and make mistakes and the former pro/ professional caster part of him, come together in a really nice mix.  Beyond that he is an amazing orator, and a genuinely nice and awesome person.  Beyond all of that though, he doesn't treat his viewers as fans, but instead as friends.  He shares himself with his viewers, the very personal and private side of himself.  He reaches out in some ways to every corner of his viewership, may it be some obscure joke, or calling out people and taking the time to be say ""so-and-so is awesome"" before a daily.  He treats his viewers in a way that I could only treat a handful of people I am personally close to.  This, on top of his amazing talent for entertaining/informative casting commentary, is why he is so popular in my opinion.

Now, for the whole life-saving part… (or at least I feel like he did).  I'm a long time atheist, and it has been a long time since I have really been afraid of death… I've struggled with depression for a long time, and like many others suffering as well, suicide is always one of those very real things on your mind.  About a year or so ago, a good friend of mine's roommate killed himself.  A seemingly happy college kid, with a lot of things going for him, not too different from myself, now gone.  It's something that at the very least has left me thinking quite a lot.

As I stated, I've always been pretty depressed, but I've fought it with relentless positivity.  I really enjoy helping others, including my girlfriend, Felicity :P, who also has a lot of difficulties with depression, and I were our own little support group.  Things were looking great around this time, back in the spring of 2011 when I was playing a lot of Starcraft and had just gotten into Day9.  I was offered a job as an intern at Microsoft.  It was an amazing opportunity career-wise for me and I couldn't really turn it down.  It was going to be a long way away in Seattle, though, and my girlfriend was going through some really difficult stuff around that time.  All of this made what should have been an easy and exciting opportunity really difficult for me.

Sure enough, after about a month or so, and a good bit of discussion between the girlfriend and I, she came to the conclusion that we should break up after a long four and a half really solid years of dating. I was respectful and understanding about it, and we even still talk and see each other on occasion.  At that time, though, the mix of a stressful new job, being on the other side of the country, and the fact that this all happened right in time to be the worst 21st birthday present ever made it really rough on me.

The next day, I just didn't show up at work.  It took weeks for it to sink in fully.  Everyone at Microsoft was super cool, and I promised them I'd put in extra time.  I was… to say the least pretty emotional.  I had three really close and amazing friends that helped me out as they could, but when that stuff happens and you've already had a pretty hard time dealing with depression, you need a distraction.  Day9 was that distraction.  I started watching live every day after work.  The AHGL at this time, and getting to see the Microsoft team play live was also really awesome.

I'd fall asleep listening to his dailies or different interview podcasts he had done.  And when I felt bad, Sean was there.  Since then, when I feel shitty and bitter, I'll just put on one of my favorites.  I'll listen to the Valentine’s daily, or ""what natural expansion?"", because I never get tired of watching poor little Megumi stars try to fly :3  So many different gems and moments.  

But you know what really did it, what got me from all of that to being much more awesome?  It was Sean.  He doesn't seem that different from me.  You can tell just how much he has been through.  He has dealt with many more stressful situations than I have.  Relentlessly positive, but still having a pretty tough time dealing with everything going on, just like me.  Recently, he gave his talk on relentless positivity and gave his analogy for emotions using kittens and ninja stars.  That struck a chord.  Yeah, that’s what’s going on.  I've taken a lot of ninja stars in a row, and it suuuucked.  But after getting hit so many times, you start to get a bit numb.  Either you can start being numb to the kittens, or you can take all of that and try to maybe stand in front of a few ninja stars for someone else (or you know, help them look for kittens).

There is no limit to the different ways Sean has been there for me.  Not a celebrity, not someone I look up to-- a friend that knows just how important it is to be relentlessly positive too, and for being everything he is, I have a great respect for him.  I've been a proud subscriber since around the time he started his subscription service.  I try to stay involved and play a positive role in the community.  I remember arguing with one of my friends about how weird it would be being famous and having all these fangirls swooning over you, so I figured it'd make a pretty funny and interesting question for his AMA. [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16PNOH48Ys&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1311s) [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jzzi0/iama_day9_lol_ill_be_doing_a_live_ama_tomorrow/c2ggl2p) .  And of course that was my favorite answer :3

Also, I totally have my own version of Manfred. :3 A cute little otter named River that my ex gave me that I cuddle up with every night! MAN MODE! &lt;3

So, for all of this and a lot more. For everything you've done for us, my story along with others.  For not letting fame go to your head and taking the time to be a friend to all of your viewers for over 400 episodes now.  Thank you, Day[9].  Thank you, Sean.  

Don't ever stop doing what you do.  You quite possibly saved my life.  It has been a rough journey, and it may get rougher.  But hey, every once in a while you get a kitten. :3 &lt;3

P.S.  Just watched Daily 403 (The COMPLETE FAILURE DAILY) and that's exactly what I’m talking about.  Just sitting back and talking to his fans.  Not powering through a struggling daily.  Being open with everyone :3

TL;DR  I’ve been through a bit of shit and I’ve struggled with depression, but Day9 and how awesome and friendly he is with his fans, is a constant pick-me-up.  He brings the kittens!

I started [penspinning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7s4E94-No#t=40) (&lt;- video) about a year ago, and I learned quickly that it's much easier with larger, heavier, and more evenly-balanced pens. So I made several of my own following [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mVd0IraeAU) for a BICtory mod.

I've never seen Day (who is much better than me at penspinning) use such a pen, so when I ran into him at Dreamhack, I gave him the one that I had with me. Starting with SOTG #60 and continuing through most of the Dailies after that, I've been seeing Day spin my pen as he reads through questions or thinks aloud. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/jhDTF.png) (not a very good one, but usually the pen is halfway out of the frame while he spins it)

So, [look for it on the show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwFE4nl_2Ik#t=1085s). It's blue on one side and black on the other (and yes, it writes with both sides). To Sean: I'm glad you like the pen :)

I'm a Zerg player who has been trying, for quite some time, to get decent at SC2. I'm a subscriber and I watch every daily live that I get a chance to. If not, I catch em on the archives.

Anyway, because of you today I did something I never thought I could. I laddered into Gold league. While this may seem like a small achievement to some, to someone who has been in the bottom tier of bronze league making zerglings and ... zerglings... this was huge for me. It showed me that I'm progressing. Last season I was in the top tier of silver, but it wasn't enough. Around new years, I decided I was going to be Plat by the end of this year.

Bronze to plat.

I'll let that sink in.

'kay, I hope that means as much to you as it did to me.

So from one SC2 fan to another, thanks Sean for helping me be a better gamer.

I watched your Daily on being positive, and your brief description of wanting something out of a relationship FOR YOU, rather than just making that relationship ""exist"" or be become repetitive. 

Your daily made me see with COMPLETE clarity what she was trying to say, and now I am out of the post-relationship funk. I even sent the video her way, and she said she could not have described it better herself.

We are now peacefully broken up, no regrets, no hatred and see each other as better people because of it, aiming to remain friends for the long run.

Thank you, Day[9] for making me not only a better gamer, but a better person.

I am a pretty huge Day9 fan in general, and i have a lot to thank him for (in terms of what his dailies have helped me to improve)

So the game starts, i've been playing SC2 since 6am that morning (on and off, about 7-8 hours in total that day) and whilst i was a touch burned out myself, the chance to play with Sean gave me a huge boost, and i was rearing to go!

To those that watched the daily, you'll see that i slowed down the game about halfway through, and very nearly disconnected. This is because whilst i was mildly burned out, i wasn't expecting my Graphics card to Burn out halfway through the match.

I panicked when the textures started swapping (my GPU had been fine all day) and when i couldn't see what was going on for about 3 minutes straight, I had the saddest look on my face possible.

I managed to sort it out temporarily, and made it to the end of the match. Just tried to turn on SC2 this morning, and my GPU bit the dust fully. Computer then refused to start. 

Most mixed feelings ever.

TL;DR: Extatic that i got to play monobattles with Day9, but in total, the game cost me £130."	t5_2rvng	True

During the break right after the game, despite the loss, he sent me a message saying forgive him for being weak. haha we all know that is not true. From there I told him that this definitely boosted my confidence for my upcoming finals later this week and then he flooded me with

This isn't anything all that profound or life changing, but I just wanted to write a post to thank Day for helping me be a happy person.

I started watching the Daily pretty much when SC2 was released. I live in Australia, and because of how the time zones line up, I can hardly ever watch it live, and I can't say that I watch every episode, but I do watch them every now and then, especially if there are ones that I think would be particularly beneficial. At the moment, I'm 17 and about to finish High School and over the past few months, I've been faced with the wonderful question of what I'm going to do when I'm done and as I'm sure most of you know, it's a pretty daunting task.

This year hasn't been all that great for me, there have been a few personal problems, which I won't go into the details of, and that has only been compounded by the stress of school and trying to work out what I want to do with my life. Over the past few months, I haven't really liked the person that I've become as I tried to find my own way of dealing with these things and I can't say that I've felt truly 'happy' in a while.

Also, I haven't really found anything in my life up until this point that I've truly loved doing. I mean, there are things that I like and there are things that I don't like, but I haven't really found anything that I love and want to do when I finish school. I guess in the High School setting, it might be a little hard to be able to imagine all the possibilities but, nevertheless, I haven't really felt at ease with any decisions that I make, and I've always been worrying - 'Is this the best thing that I can be doing right now?' or 'What is the best use of my time? Am I being productive?' and things like that.

Yesterday, I watched the latest AmA daily where Sean answered questions from the Reddit community and the chat and that kind of thing, and I think I was really able to relate to how he described himself feeling when he started college and everything (I'm sure you guys have seen it, so I won't go into it) but the advice that he gave has really helped me to I guess kind of change my outlook on life at the moment. 

I've decided to start to make a list of the things that make me happy, and just do that. I'm going to try and not worry about income and careers being viable and that kind of thing, because more than anything I think it's important to be happy in life. I've also realised that I want to change how I interact with others, so that I can be a positive aspect of their life and try to make them happy too.

Like I said, my story is nothing exceptional, but I wanted to thank you Day9 for your great advice, you're definitely one of the people who I look up to and I wish you the best of luck in all that you do both for the E Sports community and in your personal life. Thanks again Sean.

TL;DR: Day's advice has been incredibly helpful and inspirational when it's come to answering some of the harder questions in my life at the moment, I want to thank him for that."	t5_2rvng	True

The daily was great and I'm sure we know now that if the day9tv thing doesn't work out for some reason, nerds will watch him ladder on Starcraft all day and night.  I think this was unprecedented that he actually ""laddered"" and played live for the first time in a competitive fashion and that's awesome in of it self!

1325321196.0	nxd2m	Dear Day[9]: Why you should stream ladder games	WolfBro	88	24	25	"Hi Sean, I was the ""Micro Amanda"" guy you met at the NASL grand finals.


As you know, there are thousands of us that would very much like to see you stream some ladder games. In the past, you've alluded to the reasons you haven't being due to being embarrassingly terrible. 


Well first of all, I totally get that. I am very critical of myself and most of the time I never play as well as I should have and I hate to put that out there for anyone to see, especially when submitting a replay for analysis. So I definitely don't judge you for that and hopefully all of your fans can join in on the sentiment. 


And I honestly don't think you'll ever really get to that point where you have practiced enough to be fully confident in doing so as your life is far too busy and structured where hours of practice per day likely won't happen unless you change things a lot.


In the mean time, we really want to see you stream. I have been watching Artosis' stream the last week or 2 and I absolutely love the format of it, getting to watch him play and then get his analysis of each game afterwards. I think if you did this, it would be immensely beneficial to all of us who watch. I find Artosis' stream to be so helpful and you are by far the best at game analysis so I imagine it would be even better.


And if you streamed, yeah, there will be haters. There will be people who will fill the chat with nonconstructive criticisms and ""you sucks"" and crap like that. It happens every night in Artosis' stream and he's banned probably a few hundred people so far. 


But you know what? Fuck those people. There are thousands of us who won't care if you make mistakes, who won't care if you lose some games.


We realize you aren't currently grand masters. We realize that you don't get to sit down and play very often. 


WE WON'T JUDGE YOU!!!


And we will shun and flame those haters who will.


So please, consider it. 


We know you aren't a full time pro-gamer. We've been watching Artosis and he's been making a lot of mistakes. It's understandable that he would since he doesn't get to play much and we know the same would be true of you. But we will still learn so much and it would be so fun.


Thank you!"	t5_2rvng	True

How about this instead? Fix the problem! Picture this: you MUST keep your supply under 50 food per ACTIVE base, but you must have over 50 food to launch your first attack. As a result, you must expand early and attack often. Simple as that. I bet it would force bronzers out of their shell a lot and make them better players, and the games are guaranteed to be full of action.

Reading is not as easy as one would think. It's not just about knowing your opponent's race and scouting. Not all of us have played RTSs for the last 15 years, so scouting and seeing a 4 gate usually tells us nothing or just creates the dilemma of not knowing whether to mass go pure speedlings, go for roaches, or a mix of both  And by the time we set our minds to a course of action, it's GG time.

Without knowing how to read your opponent, scouting is just the way to know where your opponent spawned. Without knowing how to read and react, the decision to harass is based solely on whether or not you feel like harassing.

But even if you start to learn how to read your opponent knowing how to react is tough. You may know what to build, but not how much of it or for how long. Do I do counter attack after cleaning up or let my army recuperate? it's not just about having the knowledge as it the ability to relate it to your current game. 

I know it's such a newbie not to know, but that's what Tuesdays are for... right?

And if not DayJ who are we (the n00bs) to turn to?

I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now...

At the end of dailies he does, Day[9] takes a few questions from the chat and usually answers to those topic-of-the-day related questions... but as a chat reader, I see a lot of questions which are not topic-of-the-day related and I thought it would be interesting if you put your questions in this tread and, if he wants, Day[9] could either answer your questions here or do another AMA [like he did a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/day9/comments/kikoi/day9s_ama_question_to_question/) which both of the situations would be great! :D


To make the thing more interesting either for us and for him, I suggest you to take a look at those early questions which had already been answered by Day[9].
With that, we'll be sure that there will be all-new questions with all-new answers!


So here are a bunch of questions which were already answered (if you haven't already watched those interview/Q&amp;A/AMA, I strongly recommend that you do so!)

EDIT : At the moment (March 15th 2012, 17:52 pm EST), we have these questions which have been submitted! :) Thank you and Keep on posting them below! :)


1. From fauxnetikz:
&gt; Day[J], do you use the Dvorak layout? I'm a fast freakin' typist (~110wpm) but it seems that you type like 30% faster than me. Doesn't seem very easy with QWERTY.

2. From Wolflink:
&gt; Why U no stream ladder D':?

3. From cokanicola:
&gt; I just want to know whether he prefers blondes, brunettes or redheads.

4. From easy_being_green:
&gt; I've always thought that Day9 should show his own funday monday replays, perhaps ending every Monday with his attempt. How about it, Day9? Can we see you bring a spine crawler with you tonight?

5. From inkling_19:
&gt; :D How are you? :3 Also, do Nutella cupcakes sound like a good idea?

6. From veloc1rapt0r:
&gt; Dear Day[9], as a Protoss, PvP is always my weak point. I have solid builds for facing Zerg and Terran, but Protoss troubles me. There have been a few dailies recently highlighting a couple of big players' PvP play (Grubby and HerO no less), but could we have a daily with your take on this matchup and basic outlines of builds you use in it? Thanks &lt;3 &lt;3

7. From Pelinore:
&gt; Dear Day9, should Esports prove to grow faster in another part of the world (For instance the other end of America, or Europe), would you consider moving or migrating in order to stay close to the action. (For instance to avoid time zone issues or travel times.) PS: You were wrong. Green is still the best.

8. From Pelinore:
&gt; Dear Day9, you have stated on many a daily that you are a big fan of the Hunger Games books. This leads me to believe that, as many of your fellow nerdlings do, you spend quite some time considdering what you would do if your name was to be picked. Do you have a plan ready in case you had to compete, and if yes (if not improvise) what would you do to come out on top? &lt;3

"	t5_2rvng	True
1326791966.0	oknwe	Thank you, Day[9], for helping me be a better sleeper!	sleepynine	51	6	27	"Throw away account because I feel embarrassed, but I really wanted to share....




So I'm a fan of the Day[9] Daily and watch it live and archived when I can. I also have a problem with sleeping. I usually don't fall asleep until around 3 or 4 am even though I got into bed at 12 or 1 am and I tend to have nightmares (really vivid ones, usually about zombies) frequently. It really sucks as because I'm just constantly tired. I don't like taking the sleeping drugs though, since I've seen how my mother acts on it. I've tried falling asleep to music, movies and white noise, but those don't really work, I just stay up and pay attention to them. I've tried tea before bed, but that just makes me need to use the restroom. I've even tried that mind trick where you make your muscles relax and imagine your happy place. Unfortunately, they don't work for me. One day, my boyfriend suggested watching #100 again before I went to bed, because its an awesome one. So I downloaded it to my Zune, got into bed and turned it on. And actually fell asleep. I think I feel asleep about 20 minutes into it, but it kept playing. And I didn't have nightmares for once! \o/

 

I'm not saying you're boring though! I'm saying that watching 100 helped me calm down enough to fall asleep and not have horrific dreams where I watch my family get torn to shreds. So thank you, Day[9] for bringing me nights of good, nightmare free sleep. And I really hope this didn't creepy anyone out...



**TL;DR version**: Day[9]'s sexy voice soothes the soul and prevents night time monsters from getting you while you try to sleep.

So, what I would love to see from Day[J] is a daily(series) which is mostly directed at the higher level players (diamond/master). 

There is alot of information out there for ""newbies"" on how to approach the game and start improving. But at  the higher levels I feel like the information is very limited if not very close to none.

This I think would help alot of people including me because I just feel pretty lost and unsure what to focus on.

What I find impressive is how effective he is in his production and resource spending. That and how he seems to attack like a Zerg but with Terran units. A very aggressive style that shows no fear in terms of moving forward thanks to a great macro game that reinforces production behind his aggressive play. I can't speak to his pro-readiness but he seems to be very fundamentally strong (or maybe Day[9] can say I'm wrong here?)."	t5_2rvng	True
1335757968.0	sz82y	Funday Monday Idea: Macro Nexus	munsosl	37	4	8	For the next Protoss Funday Monday I think it'd be funny if before a Protoss player expands he has to create a second nexus in his most recent base. I think all those extra chrono boosts would be useful but I know on some maps the space a nexus takes up is just not good for building placement.	t5_2rvng	True

I personally want to see the ""A day in the life of Day[9]"" that was suppose to be the idea for 200. 


OR perhaps we could see a match with DJWheat or Husky? Some fellow caster would be really fun. X3 



So yeah, post your ideas here! :D



**EDIT:** If I get a bunch that are really awesome, but it kind of stops at certain number, I think I might make a Google Poll and post it to see which idea has the most support and email like the top three to his feedback email. :3

**EDIT 2:** I'm loving all the ideas! :D So, is anyone interested in the poll idea as well? It might make it easier to choose from a list of the ideas and see how much support each one gets. I can alter it as we go. :3


**EDIT 3:** So far, the suggestions are:

-Day[9] does a 24 hour stream (Possibly for charity.)

-Laddering live and possibly analyzing matches after.

-Day in the life of Day[9].

-Introduction to SC2 video (very in-depth).

-Brood War Special

-""My Life in StarCraft"" part two, possibly featuring Tasteless as extra commentary.

-""Best of Day[9]"" videos.

-Matches against fellow casters/brother.

-Day[9] puppet host.

-3v3 or 4v4 FFA with alliances with some available pros (if the pros want, of course!)"	t5_2rvng	True

1306330451.0	hjrm4	Last night I had a dream about Day[9]...	seanmg	47	13	12	"and in that dream I was at a big social event like the Olympics, except Starcraft was there, and Day9 was casting.  About halfway through the day, we realized that even though we were watching SC2, there was in fact a SC1 even being held, and Day9 was one of the competitors.  We wanted to see Day9 play, so we went to the stands in another part of the building.

The stands surrounded what was a giant open space.  Slightly confused by the different scenery we waited until everyone else filled in for the competition begin.  At some point day9 shows up, and begins to warm up.  He changes into these athletic shorts, and like warm-up t-shirt, and all of a sudden he's wearing ice-skates.  Like huge, real deal ice-skates.  He enters the competitive area, and begins to glide effortlessly.  I look down and he is in fact ice-skating on water.  Not ice, water.  I'm genuinely impressed, but having never watched a starcraft 1 event, I take it for what it is and get excited about the competition.  Suddenly, we're in the competition, and day9 is up.  He glides out onto the water, and all of a sudden various units and buildings of Starcraft pop up out of the water, and day9 shoots them with an imaginary gun.  He's doing something that can only be described as a cross between starcraft, ice-skating, and water polo.  Of course he wins the competition, and the stadium is filled with confetti.  Standard play, if I've ever seen it.

**TL;DR:** I had a wet dream about Day-9 ice skating, and Day9 can walk on water."	t5_2rvng	True

Why is this good?  Let's see:

* You can't turtle and then expand, because you need to expand to their natural before they do
* You'll need to be aggressive early on to contain them in their base
* Hilarious capacity for base trades after you both expand to naturals, and then take out eachothers mains

Every race has a nice little ""cheese"" tactic they can employ to try to stop the opponent from taking their natural.  Terran can get tanks to cover the natural, protoss can do early cannon contain, and zerg can place spine crawlers above the natural (or go for 6-pool lings to get early map control).

RelleK_Forger	40	12	8	"Just a funday monday suggestion, take it or leave it, but I think it would be fun to see some protoss games where the protoss does not use warpgates. They can use gateways though. Personally I think that some interesting compositions could be cause because people would be playing with more robo/stargate play. Maybe even find a really cool unit composition that is ignored because of the current meta game.

I understand that this will be hard for protoss, but most Funday Monday's are pretty difficult to pull off. For example the neural parasite Funday Monday was probably the most impossible Funday Monday yet.

1335252095.0	spn91	Bring back Friend-day Wednesday!	Waklface	31	1	2	"Personally I find that Friend-day wednesday's are the archived episodes that I actually go back to watch multiple times. I feel that these episodes help me grow as a gamer and (as a bonus) are some of the most interesting to watch. 

It's not often we get to hear a professional SC2 player explain the exact choices in their build and, in these dailies, we not only see the strengths of interesting builds, but learn all of the different scenarios that could occur and what to do in each scenario. As an added bonus we learn more about pro players and see them interact with one of the best analytical minds in the SC2 scene.

I can't describe how much I appreciate the combination of Pro Player + Specific Build + Sean's Questions + Multiple Games of that specific build all wrapped up into one 60-90 minute Daily.

Personally, I would love to see Friend-day Wednesday be a more regular occurrence (it's been a long time...).

I'm not sure why the mods haven't said something about this, or if I'm the only one bothered by this... but, contrary to popular belief, this is not Day9's email for Funday Monday idea suggestions.  That would be feedback@day9.tv. 

It was pretty cool that Sean used Reddit one time as a mean of determining a Funday Monday topic, but there is a system in place for such ideas.

This subreddit, in my understanding of it, is a cool community of Day9 fans who share cool stuff about Sean with each other.  There hasn't been much content lately beyond topic suggestion threads and truthfully this has me feeling really sad :(

So, maybe you don't agree and think posts like this are perfect for this subreddit.  Feel free to say so in comments, but in my opinion, this is getting kind of ridiculous.

For those of you who don't want to read it, basically it says that having less minerals per base (either 7 or 6 patches) would increase the breadth of gameplay.

It brings up some pretty interesting concepts, and obviously the more people experiment with the ideas, the more we can learn about it.  There's already a tournament coming up for it, but I think if it were a Funday Monday, we could see a surge in people playing.

1330102836.0	q48pc	Funday Monday Brainstorm	Hiroic	41	8	22	"Here's a couple of ideas I had floating around, I don't know if any have been suggested before:

###Track and Attack (Terran only)
#Can only attack areas that are within the radius of a Sensor Tower.
The idea is to encourage innovation with an underused building, which could lead to new interesting tactics and slow pushes. 
E.g. Do a tank contain with a tower and scan the high ground whenever enemy units are near.
 
###Behind Enemy Lines (All races)
#Before your first attack, you must designate a unit to be 'Ryan' (hotkeyed to 0). Due to losing all his brothers, he is not allowed to fight and must be brought home alive at all costs. You must type a quote from a war film before fighting your way to Ryan's position and once secure, retreat back to your base; where a new Ryan will be designated. 
The aim of this to encourage attacking with limited objectives.
E.g. Ryan could be a reaper hidden in the back of a zerg expansion, I'd type in chat ""Get to da choppa!"", then do a medivac drop and kill drones before retreating with Ryan.
 
# 
###Triple Combo (All races)
#Must obey the rules from any three previous Funday Mondays (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Day9_Daily) and subtly inform your opponent at the beginning. I have no idea if this is viable!
E.g. Mass Queens (Ep 256), attack every 5 mins (Ep 223) and only attack on creep (Ep 328).
 
# 
###Stack'em High (All races)
#Have to attack at least three times using 'stacked' units.
This can be done in the following ways:
# - Stack up workers on unbuilt refineries
# - Drop units in a constricted space
# - Nydus into a constricted place (can send drones through to make evolution chambers)
# - Use force fields to constrict units
# - Send units into a Vortex and then pylon wall off
# - Sequentially pick up units with Graviton Beam and then wall off
The main idea is to innovate new tactics, e.g. in a 2v2 game, you could use sentries to forcefield 20 tanks into one position and then siege up.
 
# 
###Look No Hands! (All races)
#All battles must be controlled using only hotkeys and by commands issued via the minimap.
The main aim is too encourage multitasking and to show that most actions can be performed by this method. Also teaches new tricks like minimap feedbacking and formation blinking.

# 
###Bullet Time (All races)
#Play a custom game on the slowest time setting.
It completely changes the nature of the game, making it very strategic and allowing perfect macro while microing multiple armies. Replays watched at normal speed are really entertaining with 300 APM! It's also a useful teaching aid for doing specific builds.
 
# 
###Bait and Switch (Terran only)
#Only allowed one tech lab at a time.
The aim is to encourage innovation within limited constraints and switching buildings.
E.g. Do a cloak banshee opening into siege tank push."	t5_2rvng	True

I'd like to know if it is chosen or not and if we will see him soon.
I think he has a talent for teaching in his dailies, but I kinda miss the hardcore caster that he was. 

I hope we will see him more and that he doesn't tend to turn out like Tasteless, who has chosen to explain SC to newcomer rather that being an analytical beast. Also I'd really like to have a ""Hardcore Thursday"" or something like that.

1327694264.0	ozj9y	Day[9] Made Me Do It - A humble thank you to Sean Plott/Day[9]	HelixDnB	35	5	12	"If some of you know me, you know I’m quite a Starcraft 2 player. While I’m not all that good (High Gold/Low Platinum on US servers, and High Silver/Low Gold on Korean servers), I still try my best to learn from each win or loss. The problem for me coming into SC2 was a complete lack of RTS experience. Now I, like the rest of you, probably played a ton of Red Alert, Starcraft 1, Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3, Red Alert 2, Total Annihilation, etc with “10 mins, no rush!” type games with your brothers/friends. Stepping into SC2 I would just get obliterated since I had absolutely no idea what I was doing – frustrating to say the least. When I was searching around for video tutorials I stumbled upon some youtube archives of the Day[9] Daily. Not only have I learned a LOT from watching one Sean Plott, aka Day[9], about the game of Starcraft 2, but, he’s turned me on to some fantastic music that I didn’t know about before (shocking, I know). One of those groups is Blue Sky Black Death. After hearing “Swords From Driftwood” on his show…I HAD to hear more. Needless to say I’ve become a HUGE fan of theirs after not even knowing about them even just a few months ago. I’ve done a few single artist mixes before: DJ Shadow, 2 Teebee mixes, Hybrid, and even 2 All Movin Shadow mixes when I heard the label was disolving. This is the newest “All Artist” mix – all Blue Sky Black Death. I made this mix as my way to say thank you to Day[9] for four things:

Exposing me to so much amazing new music (Ludique, BSBD, Purity Ring, etc)

Teaching me an absurd amount about the game of Starcraft 2

Making me a better gamer

Putting so much effort into the community – his passion and energy are tireless

For all of this, I have to thank him. I’ve made huge strides in my play due to his dailies alone, and I’ve also begun to think about games in a different way – understanding the WHY of what we do in addition to the how and what of what we do. Sean/Day[9] – Thank you, sincerely, for everything that you do!

Often, after a shitty day of school, I'll sit down, do some stats, and enjoy the hilarity of our loving Starcraft god, Day9. But I feel like recently, they have been amiss. While I still enjoy them, I no longer learn anything from them. They were originally designed to place arbitrary limits on the game (can't build stalkers, battlecruiser rush, etc.) I feel like those helped us explore the game, even at a low level. The recent Fundays, while enjoyable, have somewhat gotten away from this goal. While i do enjoy close games, I feel it is outside the purpose of Funday Mondays.
I doubt Day9 will lose any followers, I am just curious if there is a reason we stopped the arbitrary restrictions?"	t5_2rvng	True

I listen to your daily all the time and I really dig the music you play during breaks. This NewbieTuesday you promoted Trentemøller and Blue Sky Black Death. I dug them so much that i am going to buy their stuff from their websites.

My request is, could you publish a playlist on your website of what you are listening to? It doesnt necessarily have to be what you play during the show (although during breaks, it seems like most of the chat is asking eachother what song it is you are playing), but more like a 'What day9 is digging right now' type of playlist. You dont even have to worry about keeping it updated....maybe just publish a new one every few months....

My idea would be this: to hallucinate a realistic looking army (i.e. zealots, stalkers, collossi) to distract your opponent out of position so that you can attack their base unhindered. You could also then have the opportunity of forcefielding them out of their main while you attack with your real army.

This is good news for esports in general, because this not only helps stubborn people to get out of their starcraft elitism, it helps those who play both speak up.

I know you need to harass, but I always harass horribly and am never prepared for the max roach at twelve minutes (a timing every zerg I now play seems to nail to a T.) I'm a top gold player trying to get into platinum, and while my pvp and pvt are good enough to advance me, I haven't yet cracked the pvz where the three base max roach just kills me.

If you could do a daily on this I would really appreciate it, as you always have been a great inspiration to me :)

As a Gold level Protoss, I found myself stagnating into a wait till maxed, then push army.

By forcing myself to attack at 11 minutes or so a I got an ""ah ha!"" moment. I came to the conclusion that the other guy is also vulnerable, also trying to macro etc and it is (certainly at my level) better to just attack and go for it...Pressure is always better when your the one doing it.

Since then I have found myself creating some nice Immortal Voidray pushes at 12 minutes into second expand in PvT, and my PvZ has an Archon Immortal push around the same time...Each time I completely demolish my opponent, it was not even a fair fight.

I feel like a child with a massive toy box, looking at these units in a cool way.  

I need to figure out a way to get a Mothership out pretty early, to then push on two base and recall back into expand, or just use the Mothership defensively with the toilet for defence while I get a third.  EDIT: Hmmm maybe I could start my mothership as I was pushing out and taking my third,and have it to fall back on should I need to pull back.

But yea, this episode has helped me see the game in a new light.  Thanks day9!

1. Rally all your production buildings to your opponents base.
2. You are not allowed to micro the units unless they engage in battle.
3. Protoss are not allowed warp gates (defeats the purpose) 
For zerg, only 1 queen allowed per base and overlords do not apply to the rules.

Creep tumors give vision, so the creep mechanic in ZvZ is more about vision than the speed boost in ZvP/ZvT.

Probably the condemning of blocking the opponents creep spread while extending your own was originally brought out for humor (and it was pretty funny) but with all the other ""zomg!  this is awesome!"" about queens and broods he could have added something about ""zomg!

involving Neural Parasite"		27	9	24	"I played a game where I neural parasited my opponent's scv to make a cc just for fun, but that sparked an idea. 

We transition into a tvt or a pvp from playing a zvt or a zvp. 

Basically, you use Destiny-style and tech to infestors, only your goal is to grab an idle probe etc and make it build a nexus/cc with neural parasite etc.

From here, you are only allowed to use your opponents units, while your own units must be sacrificed so you can transition into becoming a Terran/Protoss.
