1332644772.0	rc8m2	Yesterday a video was deleted from YouTube: The Sweatbox, an animation documentary that Disney has successfully suppressed for 10 years. Here's how you can see it. 	WhitherUganda	44	5	5	"[The Sweatbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweatbox#The_Sweatbox) reveals the drama that went on during the creation of ""The Emperor's New Groove"". To give you an idea of how rare it is, it was only screened twice at film festivals in 2002. Disney then forbade its release and ordered copies of it destroyed. It's so hard to get a hold of that a Disney representative had to accompany a copy at all times during a rare screening at Pixar:

&gt; It seems that -- in mid-2002 -- the folks at Pixar Animation Studio wanted to hold a screening of ""The Sweatbox"" for all of the employees working at their Emeryville, CA. studio. So -- after a little negotiation -- Disney agreed to send a copy of the film up to Pixar ... provided that the print was always accompanied by a Disney studio representative.

&gt; And when I say ""always,"" I mean ""ALWAYS."" The story that I hear is that ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Docter actually offered to take the print's guardian down to Cafe Luxo for a quick bite to eat. The Disney studio representative refused, allegedly saying: ""If I ever let this copy of 'The Sweatbox' out of my sight, it could wind up costing me my job.""

So you can see how shocking it is that, two days ago, a 480p version was uploaded to YouTube. It far surpasses the quality of the previous bootlegged version, and is a direct transfer from a master VHS tape. It lasted two days and got 30,000 views before it was removed.

Re-uploading it to YouTube isn't an option, and with seizures of domains like MegaUpload, rampant anti-piracy measures at HotFile, RapidShare, etc., it'd only be a matter of time before it will be removed there. Fortunately, there's still a way for you to see it.

1. Download and install [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/). I2P is an anonymous network. It lets you browse a darknet and share information without corporations like Disney dictating what you can and can't see.

2. Once I2P is running, open ""I2P Snark,"" which is a BitTorrent client. You can do so by clicking ""Torrents.""

3. Paste the following magnet URL into the ""From URL"" box under ""Add Torrent.""  This will indicate to the network that you want to download *The Sweatbox*:

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97a76d8e0acb341cbb8811e50a367b197fa9a8f7&amp;tr=http://tracker2.postman.i2p/announce.php

[screenshot](http://s18.postimage.org/khfmhustz/tmpscreenshot.jpg)

(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can click ""Postman"" to access that I2P BitTorrent tracker. Search for ""The Sweatbox"" there, or check the recent torrents.

4. Click ""Add torrent"" and wait. The page will refresh and indicate when the file starts downloading. 

I2P will be much slower than the regular Internet as your traffic has to bounce around peers in order to make it anonymous. You can help make the file faster for others by seeding it. Just let your computer and I2P run even after the file has downloaded. 

There are other ways to share files, such as The Piratebay and private BitTorrent trackers. These aren't anonymous, and private trackers don't allow just anybody to share information. You have to belong to a special club. 

The value of this documentary is so high, however, and the content so compelling, that hopefully you won't mind learning how to use a new, cutting edge, open, and truly anonymous technology. One day you too might depend on the anonymity that I2P provides.

***TL;DR/why should I care?***

**Synopsis -- or, why animators think it's kick-ass that this documentary suddenly surfaced two days ago:**

Similar to ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Sweatbox"" offers a titillating glimpse into what it's like to work at an animation studio. Traditionally Disney has tried to present the appearance that their movies are created in a very flowing, gentile manner (in keeping of the spirit of the ""old men"" of animation, and Disney himself), and have suppressed information to the contrary. This documentary really paved the way to dispelling that smokescreen.

Basically if you like film making, animation, or wonder what it's like to work on a project where hundreds of people are literally pouring their hearts and souls into a project that (should something go wrong) could crash and burn tomorrow, you'll probably enjoy it. The film starts out with an animator whispering that the producers hated the first version, and they're all upstairs in a story room discussing six different pitches for the future of the movie. He admits that they might actually decide to kill the movie outright (which isn't unprecedented in animation studios), which would mean, literally, that hundreds of people would lose their jobs just like that. These are artists who pore their heart and soul into their work, and it shows. At some point they (accurately) talk about how getting a character cut from the script is very similar to the feeling of losing a part of your life. Something you've literally spent years creating suddenly being worthless and lost, as if it died

You also get to see plenty of pencil tests, storyboards, interviews with the creators, and brainstorming meetings. Including one where they basically call in the most respected names in animation to try and brainstorm a way to save ""The Kingdom of the Sun"", the then-name for ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

It also has an aura of mystery around it, because it's basically shocking that THIS movie, which has been so rare and hard to obtain, suddenly surfaced in excellent quality! It's satisfying that, after ten years of Disney suppressing the film to the point of requiring its representatives to literally not let it out of their sight, it suddenly surfaces."	t5_2rgdp	True

1371839565.0	1gt5ou	Some quick posting guidelines for r/ObscureMedia (not final)	AAjax	40	3	4	"Well it seems the anarchy based model of this sub has come to an end. 

The mods are coming up with community etiquette/posting  guidelines but in the meantime here are a couple FYI

1) This is a content based sub, therefore we want the goods and nothing else will suffice. Links to blogs  are not welcome. Posts to review/digest pages of like mind are also not welcome. We want our subscribers to come to their own conclusions and have direct access to content, if you wish to submit your or others views in such form they are welcome only as a comment post from an original link to the full/complete content (or what is available, lets face it not everything is complete) 

2) Short clips from content are discouraged. We want full and complete content (as much as is available) If you wish to highlight a portion of content in a post please use the youtube timestamps option while still linking to the full content (if avail) 
[Here is how that works](http://youtubetime.com/)
 

3) Arguing about what is obscure enough to be posted should be left to the domain of the upvote/downvote and the moderators. What is obscure to me? Not much, yet I am constantly surprised by what you guys come up with. But understand the word obscure in the sub title is not a  rigid definition but a suggestion to look deeper. As pointed out by one of our subscribers many posts here can be considered ""Obscure 101"" We want as many people involved for the search for content as possible and perhaps that may require breaking in people to what is/was obscure at one time (but may not be so much now) In short to get a ""feel"" for the sub. Obscure should not be the sole domain of content availability but the viewpoints expressed and the hope to share those viewpoints artistically/by-narrative.

4) Request threads: We will have/bring back a weekly request thread (On Fridays) please post your requests there. You must know the name of the content or at least the names of the people involved in the production. If you are drawing a complete blank please head over to /r/tipofmytongue they are awesome at that. 

5) POST THE RELEASE YEAR in the post title! If not available a educated guess or 197? 196? tag will suffice

6) Be nice, if you post a rudely condescending/attacking/generally dick-ish comment you will be banned with no prior warning. 

7) Reposts: We are getting tons of re-posts. Search before you post, this will require you to know the actual title of the content, we will be pulling posts that are either obvious reposts or mis-titled. In 7 days from this post we will start pulling posts without release year (or best guess as stated above) 
 You are welcome and encouraged to re-post links to content that has a obsolete/dead link listed in the archives, please take the time to list it as ""replacing obsolete link"" in the comment section. 


Please understand this is something I NEVER wanted to happen here. Definition by its meaning can limit ideas. For the first 3 years of this sub we had no posted rules and pulled a whopping 1 post and had never banned a user. In the last 3 months that has changed dramatically. The influx of blogger posts, 1 minute clips and wholesale reporting of submissions has brought us to this. Those of you that have been around for awhile know we try to be as open as possible to new ideals of what this sub can have  to offer, but unfortunately a relatively un-moderated model here is no longer possible.

ABOVE ALL:
 If you are not seeing the ""obscure"" content that you would hope to see here *Be the change you hope to see*  go out and find streaming links and post them! Get the goods, or go home. 

If we pull your post, please don't be discouraged but be open to what we are trying to provide here. Consider it more or less a free video on demand content service, or for you old geezers like myself the UHF channel we always dreamed of. Finding interesting content isn't always easy, but I feel if you hang around long enough it will be something that you not only enjoy but will want to be an active participant in. "	t5_2rgdp	True

I have been looking foe these tapings since he passed away last year and i am having no luck. He sang and played guitar. This would have been early to mid 70's.

EDIT:The year was 1977 Jamie Farr, and Jay P. Morgan were judges and my Mom couldnt remember the third. He performed under the name Michael Manley Miller (his real name) and when he won he picked the host up and spun him around. The only tape my family had of this was destoyed in hurricane Katrina and fondong it would mean a lot. Thanks again. He's the third one from the left

I can try to describe it - 

It was an experimental short, probably in the 80's or early 90's from Europe (I think). It was a one take shot of a room, where the same people kept entering/leaving the room. This repeated until there were 50 or so of the same ~10 people in the room. 

One person was a child, who kept going to the window. 
Another was a woman in the garden. 
Another was a woman and a young man on a bed.

On YouTube, I have located an anti-smoking commercial featuring the ""CATS"" cast, so apparently they were doing a PSA jaunt in the 80s when the show was big on Broadway.  However, I cannot find the ""child in the car"" commercial.
