1364155500.0	1axh6o	Are neuroscience PhD students just becoming over qualified research technicians/assistants?	greenbirds	61	10	15	"I have a BS in biochemistry and for a while was determined to pursue a PhD in developmental neuroscience. But just searching for job opportunities (either in academia or biotech industries) I have hardly seen any listings that require a PhD in neuroscience, comparatively PhDs in proteomics and protein chemistry seem to be in the highest demand. In other internet forums I have heard people report there are far too many people with neuroscience PhDs than there are jobs available for them. I am starting to feel pursuing this type of graduate degree would not be a wise investment. Ideally my long term goal is to be an academic professor but the level of competitiveness I am hearing about suggests even being enrolled in top doctorate/post doc programs will not be enough to guarantee this type of position.

I am just curious, what the neuroscience reddit community feels on this position, those who hold PhDs in neuroscience, what type of jobs have you landed? Is the academic tenure track really that competitive? Also I am curious what the average post doc stipends are, (I am always hearing conflicting things).

A little more info, I've worked in several labs as an undergrad/intern in academia and for biotech companies. I'm currently working in a neuroscience lab I'm really happy in but can't help but feel I could have achieved a more prestigious degree. I just do not want to spend years of my life on furthering my education only to end up working back where I am now (or worse). Any advice is greatly appreciated."	t5_2r3cs	True

One of the ideas we will start rolling out with is a weekly sub-reddit Journal Club. This week, I went to PLOSone and picked the article ""[Misrepresentation of Neuroscience Data Might Give Rise to Misleading Conclusions in the Media: The Case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014618)"" 


Here are the guidelines for participation. 

* You must read the whole article in order to participate in discussion 
* No racism, sexism or bigotry in the article discussion 
* You are encouraged to ask questions if you need clarification for a specific part of the article 
* Disagreements are fine, but please, keep it civil 

I am sure other issues will come up as a we do this, but that is all I can think of for now. I love Journal clubs and am excited to see how this goes.

I am involved in a project that is attempting to write a free introduction to neuroscience text by crowd sourcing it out to students. [You can check it out here,](http://neuro-cloud.net/TextbookWiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#About_Neuro-Cloud) if you go to the writing team page you can see that we are looking for a few more writers to be responsible for chapters. Additionally, I would like to have some contributors who could help with those who are falling behind.

Our goal is to have the first draft done by the end of the month, you do not need a PhD to help, and it could be a great addition to an early CV. 

While there are currently some free neuroscience textbooks, they fail to offer an experience that would make them a better choice than current commercial books, and the goal of the project is to change that. As you can see, the project is fairly ambitious. We plan to release the textbook as an App with learning tools, downloadable PDF, and a physical copy you can order at cost. 

This has been a dream of mine for some time, and would love to help make neuroscience more accessible by removing the large price tag associated with most legitimate Neuroscience learning tools. PM or comment if you are interested in helping with any part of the project. "	t5_2r3cs	True

to Misleading Conclusions in the Media: The Case of
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014618). 

I will post a observations I have had regarding the article. Feel free to comment on either the article or my points. Remain civil and have fun. 

This study is somewhat of a meta review of the literature and publishing process examining how findings get misinterpreted in the media. This is an issue that has impacted anyone who has published a paper before, or who is unfortunate enough to read a popular press article about our field. 

The authors examined 360 recent studies on ADHD for 2009 and earlier. The first thing I found interesting was the correlation between impact factor and type 2 overstatements. We all look at top tier publishing as the only way to be successful in the field, and I think that sometimes we see overstatements in manuscripts to take an exciting break-through to the level of earth-shattering. This brings up an interesting point, at what level are *scientists* responsible for misinterpretations in the media? 

The article mentioned several potential cause of data misinterpretation, How do you feel about these 2 claims?

&gt; More generally, competition
between authors to publish in high rank journals and between
journal editors distorts publication of biomedical research in favor
of sensationalism

&gt; Therefore, neuroscientists are encouraged to work in line with this
institutional demand and to preferentially publish positive results.
Even when they are published, negative results or data challenging
established dogma are often ignored both by the scientific
literature and by the media as exemplified here

Finally the article attempts to offer some solutions. 

1. ""First, because our pioneer study is mainly qualitative, we need
more studies analyzing the neuroscience discourse""

2. ""Second, the key regulators of our publication system are the journal editors. If they collectively reject sensationalism and clearly condemn data misrepresentation, we may expect rapid improvement.""

3. ""Third, the neuroscience community should lobby in favor
of research grants without any link to therapeutic applications.""

I personally find it interesting looking at the source of this study, PLOSone, and the recommendations. I am all for alternative means of publishing and think PLOSone is great, but the authors conclusions in a journal of this type seem to create a posible data misinterpretation of its own. I think it is very important to echo the limitation that this quantitate data does not apply fields in neuroscience, as the focus in on ADHD, but I think the results can be more universal. 

These are just some brief thoughts I had, what about you?"	t5_2r3cs	True

In the next few weeks we plan on revamping this subreddit. We seem to be the default for new neuroscience members, as /r/neuro is not as intuitive a first choice for the average redditor. Hopefully, we will be able to grow this subreddit and become the reddit hub for all things neuroscience. That being said, we are looking for feedback/input from the community as to the purpose of this subreddit, and some guidelines for posting. Please take some time and answer the following questions or give your own ideas.

* Should we allow anything brain related, or stick to hard posts about neuroscience? 
* Would you be interest in flair? Perhaps simple texts that reflects your level of education or specific area of study? (ie PhD, Student, MS, Addiction, Learning etc.) 
* Would you be interested in weekly themes, perhaps featuring a prominent/famous neuroscientist in the sidebar, and a thread commenting on his or her work?

Finally, you are welcome to leave any of your own ideas or input in the comments.

1363709713.0	1all69	Qualification crossroads: What is a neurobiologist to do when he wants to get into computational neuroscience?	derlumpenhund	14	1	12	"Hello, my fellow brain-enthusiasts!

I study neurobiology and am currently preparing my diploma thesis (yes, diploma, Germany was kinda late on the whole bachelor/master train). As we all know, computational approaches play an increasingly important role in all kinds of sub-branches of neuroscience. Being primarily a biologist, however, my knowledge regarding programming, advanced mathematcial concepts ect. is very limited. I have a working understanding of data processing of EEG and fMRI data, programming in MATLAB and a basic grasp on graph theory. 

I currently work on a project involving functional network analysis, and I am constantly confronted with concepts that lie wayyy outside my understanding of computational procedures and mathematics. However, I think that some of the most interesting and promising research happens in projects involving exactly those things.

So my question is: How do you think someone with a limited background as myself can get into research that focuses on computational neuroscience? Would it make sense to add another bachelor in for example computer science? Is it possible to reach a more extensive understanding by simply working through textebooks and papers? And, most importantly, do you know of any neurobiologists that were able to get into such research projects?

I have to plan my future career and would appreciate your insights on literature, courses, you name it.

**tl/dr: Can a neurobiologist get a foot in the door in mostly computation-heavy fields of research, and if yes, how?**

a) If it was worthwhile spending the time improving my coding skills but I assume this is a given as it's something I've seen suggested time and time again, especially as the work and degree programs I'm most interested is fairly computational.

[Sequencing the Connectome] (http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001411)


**Abstract:**

Connectivity determines the function of neural circuits. Historically, circuit mapping has usually been viewed as a problem of microscopy, but no current method can achieve high-throughput mapping of entire circuits with single neuron precision. Here we describe a novel approach to determining connectivity. We propose BOINC (“barcoding of individual neuronal connections”), a method for converting the problem of connectivity into a form that can be read out by high-throughput DNA sequencing. The appeal of using sequencing is that its scale—sequencing billions of nucleotides per day is now routine—is a natural match to the complexity of neural circuits. An inexpensive high-throughput technique for establishing circuit connectivity at single neuron resolution could transform neuroscience research.

I recently received funding to do some research over the summer at my university investigating the role of mirror neurons in intergroup bias, and whether mirror neurons (which give you the experience of empathy) are more able to empathize with out-group members given more experience in deriving social cues. 
We're going to do this by measuring mirror neuron activity while deriving the emotions of in/out-group members before and after the participants memorize 50 outgroup names and faces. We need about 100-200 photos of males of white, black, and asian descent.

Thing is, there seem to be **no robust databases of black faces at all.** This is incredibly surprising and, regardless of my study, needs to be remedied asap.

Some super-summarized background of things we know/things that are strongly implied about mirror neurons/empathy: 

* Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when you perform an action, experience a sensation/emotion, or observe someone else doing so. Feedback inhibition prevents you from confusing the experience of the other from yourself--you know it's not you feeling/doing it, but someone else. This equates the experience of empathy. 

* Your in-group is a group that you more closely identify with as compared to an out-group (and changes depending on the most important defining factor in a given context). For example, if you're white and were raised by white folk, your in-group is very likely white and your out-group consists of other ethnicities. If you're Muslim, your in-group is Muslim and your out-group is any other religion. If you're a professor, your in-group is other professors...you get it.

* It has been shown that mirror neuron response is lower for out-group members based on various distinctions, including race and ideology.
 
* It has been shown, in research and in real life, that exposure to others different than you enables you to better understand, relate to, and identify with them, correspondingly increasing empathy. 

* Children with autism (which results in a reduced ability to understand social cues and empathize with others) exhibit significantly reduced mirror neuron activity when observing others compared to unaffected children.

* People are more able/likely to dissociate from someone the less they are able to identify with them. I suspect this to be a requirement for groups of people to rationalize war with others.


We hypothesize that an increased experience of empathy with exposure to others is the result of the mirror neuron system having increased practice differentiating, interpreting and internalizing social signals of those proximate to you; and that intergroup bias is the result of lack of empathy, leading the brain to make judgments based on extraneous patterns and knowledge (leading to prejudice, stereotyping). We therefore predict that exposure to out-group features and social cues (such as emotional expressions) may decrease intergroup bias.

So my question is: would you be willing to donate a picture of your face for this study and/or other research that involves visual stimuli? Would you be willing to have it compiled into a database for use by other researchers?

**If so, feel free to post a pic! Or PM me and I can send you my email.**

* It would be awesome if you could snap one or more frontal photos of yourself making various emotional expressions--smiling, angry, sad, scared, neutral, or really anything--from the shoulders up. We can photoshop out the background, but no hands touching your face please. 

* For my study we're in critical need of black male faces, but there's definitely a deficiency in the community of black female faces as well. All races/genders welcome, the more the merrier!

If I get any kind of response, I will be sure to credit the reddit community both in my formal paper and presentation.

**TL;DR: There is a deficiency in photos of faces that can be used as visual stimuli in scientific studies, ESPECIALLY black faces. Wanna help me/science out with a photo of your face? Photos of males of African, Asian, and European descent expressing different emotions would all be super helpful!**"	t5_2r3cs	True

A bit of background. I graduated from a mediocre school in 2009. While there I got very mediocre grades but eventually ended up with a degree in economics. For most of my life I have excelled in classes I enjoy and did poorly in classes “I didn't see the point in"". (Big mistake I know, but unfortunately I have a sever lack of time-machine.) I test well and learn easily, I just have never had ""drive"" due to the fact that most of the time, I lacked passion. 

It took a long time, but after 4 years of university, 2 years of traveling, 2 years of ""real world"" work, and a plethora of books I have finally boiled down all my interests and curiosities to one thing. I have discovered a passion for understanding why people make the decisions that they make at the most basic level.

I am trying to reach out to as many outlets for advice as possible, so my question to you all is “What is the best way to get on track”?  

Some things I have thought of that may be options/helpful.

Should I go get another BS in neuroscience?

Should I apply to grad schools as is?  

Should I try and get a job doing something remotely related and then apply? 

Should I try and go somewhere where I can try and cross disciplines (neuroeconomics?) 

Should I dedicate a bunch of time to say, taking neuroscience related courses on MIT's opencourse? A community college?

Some important factors:

I have the money to go back to school.  In fact, it’s the only thing I have money to do. (I am lucky to have an education fund that can only be touched if I go to school. Because I went to a relatively inexpensive state school for undergrad there is still money chilling there).

I have the time and drive to really give this 110%.  I know it is what I want to do.

I’d go anywhere in the world to do this.

My grades are, as I said, pretty mediocre. But what I have done outside of university is somewhat unique. It includes living and working for a year in China, volunteering as an English teacher in in South East Asia and South America, writing freelance, taking tons of classes online, learning Chinese and Spanish, and doing some data analysis in new york for a continuing education website. 

So let it rip. I'm open to everything.

**tl;dr - I kind of slacked in University but in the 3 1/2 years since I have discovered a love of where neuroscience, psychology, and economics meet. How should I get back on track?**

I'm going to graduate with a BS in Neuroscience very soon and am curious about how I could be of assistance to the field beyond volunteering in a lab. Let's suppose that I have some debilitating form of lazyness which prevents me from attaining a PHD or being current with neuroscience literature, but that I am an able-bodied person with two good legs and above average people skills.

Is every for-pay job going to be taken by people who are more ambitious than I am?
Is there some sort of for-pay grunt-level work where I could be useful but which is perhaps overlooked/shunned by ambitious students? 
Would I be welcomed as a volunteer in a lab even if I had no desire to persue my own education any further?

I really love the field and would love to dedicate some amount of time (or perhaps an entire lifetime) to helping out more ambitious people achieve their goals, but it seems like everyone is suggesting that I should continue my own education if I'm going to seek a job in Neuroscience research (especially by attaining a PHD) which unfortunately, due to my disability, is something that I cannot actually do. 

Some possibly relevant background info: I'm into computer games, have interests in Psychology and Philosophy, love reading, am am not opposed to hard work (I'm very active) but don't think the PHD route is for me based on how much time it takes and how unstable my academic interests are. I don't really want to narrow the scope of what I'm learning about right now/narrow my world, but do want to satisfy my ""lack of meaning in life"" delimma, and working in Neuroscience research would certainly be an awesome fix for that... the best one I can think of.

This has allowed me to better understand some of the ideas behind things like Fourier transform, but I'm struggling to take it further. Ideally I would want to develop some mathematical maturity by learning how one can apply things like calculus to problems in neuroscience (e.g. looking at a problem, being able to identify it as a mathematical one and thinking about it/solving it in those terms). Of course, physics is probably ideal for this type of thing, but I'm doing this in my spare time so I really want to concentrate it a bit more than that.

What is the difference between the sub-pallium and pallium i.e. what sub-structures does each one consist of? Are they categorized by location, development or function?

Do dopamenirgic cells have specific morphologies or can cells with different morphologies have the same neurotransmittter?(obviously this is true GABA and glutamate) 

Are these cells considered interneurons, pyrimidal cells, or have their own group?

Are they typically multipolar, bipolar, or pseudounipolar?

Does the same go for all the other neurotransmitters (Seratonin, Epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine)?

How can one tell a neuron is an interneuron? Is it mostly based on morphology or is there a specific protein that interneurons stain for that other cells in the brain don't?

I really appreciate any feedback or journal articles you can point me in the direction of so I can figure this stuff out.

1372205998.0	1h2pbk	Need some help choosing with a career path	Epoh	11	1	8	"So I'm firmly set on a career in neuroscience, this is my passion, and after getting some research experience in a lab last year, I'm headed into the last year of my undergrad with a better picture of what research will be like. Fortunately, I enjoyed it quite a bit and was able to refine my interests further. 

My main interest is in systems neuroscience, particularly memory and attention, however pharmacology, neurostim and neuroplasticity are certainly in the picture as well but I'm not convinced I need to be perfectly clear on this yet. However, because these are all still possible where do I begin as far as choosing graduate programs in Canada or the U.S? How do I search various labs across the continent that may appeal to me, scan programs offered at a masters level that are top-tier and mid-tier at different universities, and learn more about potential supervisors before I take the plunge and decide on a masters program? 

I'm quite confused about the application process, and I just need to be clear about my options and what opportunities exist out there before I make a decision. I have lab experience in a developmental psychology lab working with EEG, will have 2 publications at least by the time I finish my undergrad degree in psychology, and will have at least a 3.3 GPA from a good school in Canada. Money isn't really an obstacle if a great opportunity arises. Any help would be appreciated, thanks ahead of time!"	t5_2r3cs	True

I'm a second year graduate student starting out in neuroscience. I have been thrown into an electrophysiology set up with little to no help and while I understand how to do the experiment (record field potentials) and set up an electrophysiology rig, I don't understand the theories behind what I'm doing. Can anyone recommend good books/papers/sources that would explain the theory behind electrophysiology, the techniques and just basic properties of neurons. To be clear, I have already read the chapters in the Principles of Neural Science by Kandel (5th version) and while this was helpful, I would like to understand more than this book provides. 

If anyone also knows sources to learn about different types of neurons and their firing properties (I am working in the cortex) this would also be extremely helpful. That is, differences between different types of excitatory (pyramidal vs. stellate) and inhibitory (GABA vs. glycine), fast spiking vs. regular spiking, etc.

1360618421.0	18bzq1	Hey I'm looking for suggestions for my younger brother who is interested in the field of neuroscience. 	cheetofingerz	12	1	32	"So my brother is a junior in high school at the moment and after poking and prodding him all year on a college major he has gone from writing, to films, to psychology, and has now landed on neuroscience. He is a very bright kid, he is curious by nature and loves music (he has been playing guitar for about two years now) and movies (more so plot, symbolism, theme, etc.). I've always been his role model as our father wasn't emotionally available to us nor did he partake in anything ""fatherly""; i always saw my dad as more of a financier than a father despite my wish not to. 

Anyways i've taken on the role to guide my brothers (theres another one; sophomore in high school) and i felt it best to introduce them to intellectually stimulating things like legos, TED talks, Through the Wormhole, The Beatles, Zeppelin, and Reddit. They both really latched to the music and reddit bit the most. The brother I'm inquiring for also enjoys Through the Wormhole, as well as lucid dreaming, meditation, and philosophy. Anyways to get to the point I'm curious as to what you all think would be stimulating in regards to the field of neuroscience like books, documentaries, related sub-reddits. I only rambled because i figured it may give some insight as to his personality. He is considering working neuroscience with psychology specificly; we both had a profound impact by our therapist (father related) and i think the bond he formed with her drove him to the idea of psychology in the first place. He also in interested in the inner workings of the mind/brain and the complexity of consciousness. 

Sorry for the diarrhea of the mouth.

Td;lr: my younger brother is looking to get into psychology/neuroscience, what would be something relative to stimulate him (books, documentaries, movies, subreddits, etc.). Thanks in advance everyone

Edit: also if there are any good colleges for neuroscience/psychology that any of you have attended or heard of I would appreciate the name, my brother still needs to apply to programs."	t5_2r3cs	True

Feel free to discuss over the next weeks, link will be in the sidebar	agobayer	10	1	0	"[Neural Dynamics as Sampling: A Model for Stochastic Computation in Recurrent Networks of Spiking Neurons](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002211)

**Abstract**: 

The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, in particular in view of the inherently stochastic features of their firing activity and the experimentally observed trial-to-trial variability of neural systems in the brain. In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons.

I am nearly finished with my PhD, which explores the  role of central catecholamines on volitional exhaustion (in humans). I have read heavily (relative to my field) in neuroscience and neuropharmacology because our interventions used pharmacological agents to manipulate central catecholamines. My undergraduate was in Biology and Sports Science. My interest, boiled down, is in the notion of free will and how effectively can we impose this will over our own physiology (using exercise as the experimental model).

Of the analytical skills I have developed over my PhD, I think only two are directly transferrable: immunoassays and HPLC. Ideally I would like to continue my research in animal models so that I may more directly observe the neurophysiological changes I believe to be occurring. 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, though I do beg refrain from scathing dismissals (if possible).

1357859022.0	16ccwr	Preliminary manual for printing 3D brain from T1 anatomical MRI scan	iloveoxytocin	10	1	5	"Recently, I saw some people progressing further in the method than I ever came in creating a 3D printed brain from their brain scans, and I'm currently nearly there in completing the brain in 3d printing, but am still struggling with details. Dear Reddit, I hope you have a couple of neuroscientists among you who have already done this, and could help me with my issues and create a manual that is understandable for everyone to use. Here’s a first version, without easy layout as Reddit doesn't let me somehow:



**I)** If you have a DICOM file: Transfer this to nifti, e.g. using the DICOM importer in SPM8 (for Matlab).
If you have a PAR/REC file: Transfer into nifti format (e.g. using r2aGUI, http://r2agui.sourceforge.net/)


**II)** Read nifti with SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/), in Matlab

a) Use Segment option to tear apart white from gray matter. Batch Editor interface; SPM &gt; Spatial &gt; Segment; default values are OK, but maybe a bit too coarse for the perfectionist as it uses probability maps and smoothes the image for a bit. Use the c1* output file for a nice gray matter volume and the c2* output file for a white matter volume. If you’d like to integrate the two, go to the ImCalc feature of SPM and add the two together.

b) check with MRIcroGL (http://www.cabiatl.com/mricrogl/) if you’ve got a good volume matrix (not a mesh yet!)


**III)** Read nifti in ITK-snap (http://www.itksnap.org/download/snap/register.php?link=5075&amp;root=nitrc)

a)  Open grayscale image, select .nii file (nifti)

b) Click on the ‘Snake ROI tool’ in the Main Toolbox window (top left); click ‘Segment 3D’; choose segmentation on the basis of ‘intensity regions’, click on ‘preprocess image’ and play with the  details to make sure your brain appears in one clear colour. Press ‘okay’, and ‘next’. 

c) Step 2 involves placing bubbles in your brain which will be used as point from where brain and no-brain volumes will be rendered. I found placing the bubbles outside the brain yield the easiest .stl files to read in Meshlab. Place the bubbles, press the play button, and press stop when the whole image has been calculated. Press ‘finish’. NB: unfortunately this method is coarse, and will not get all the detail from your SPM model. 

d) Now go to Segmentation &gt; Export as surface mesh, export Label 1, save as a STL Mesh file.

NB: ITK-Gray seems to be doing a better job at this, check it at http://white.stanford.edu/newlm/index.php/ItkGray


**IV)** Read .stl in Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/), you now need to:

a) Simplify your model, do this by selecting areas you don’t want. This can be cumbersome, haven’t found a good solution to skip this step yet. Make sure your brain is one whole piece and that there is a decent connection between your R and L hemisphere.

b) Waterproof your model: normals, piosson reconstruction, use this: http://vimeo.com/20933872, (however, I’m stuck at this step as I’m a neuroscientist, not a 3D modeller)

**V)** Check your model with MiniMagics (http://www.materialise.com/MiniMagics) to make sure your model will be printable by an average 3d printer. If there is any error, go back to Meshlab and (try to) improve your model. 


**VI)** You’ll now have a .stl file which will be accepted by the majority of 3D-printers. (If no printer is near, you can even have it printed and shipped to you, see http://www.shapeways.com/)
HOWEVER: make sure that you have 1 object and not many by checking it in 3D-print software (e.g. ZPrint for a ZCorps 3D-printer); my model had multiple objects in the middle (e.g. ventricles) which I could not remove myself, but a handy man at the 3D-printing lab could using Rhinoceros 4.0. Load the .stl in the programme, select the outer mesh, then select the inverse and press delete.


**VII)** PROFIT; for you are now able to, if you’re having an experiment in which participants also have their brain sMRI scanned, to give them one in chocolate for a small contribution (see http://www.makeyourownmolds.com/ for an overview what products you can use to create your own molds). (Or make it solid gold. Which will make an excellent topic starter if it’s attached to your walking cane.)

I've noticed a good amount of posts involving what literature to be reading up on, what journals/papers/resources to be reading, etc., and thought it would be very helpful to have a universal neuroscience page/post regarding the different resources and their reviews that have been suggested that could be organized in accordance with what it was relevant towards (basic or advanced, general or specific, branch of neuroscience, etc.).

In short, it would be a simplified page or post that we could quickly add any books or resources we had read and what we thought of them. I think it could save time for a lot of us and open up some good options or suggestions on literature for those of us who were interested. I know theres a lot of stuff out there in the big bad interweb, and this would be one measure to make it a little more simplified so we could spend more time on what we really found interesting or helpful.

Also, we could possibly have some generalized posts regarding advice for those starting to become interested in the field, those seeking education, research methods, even methods on studies or work in the field, etc.

I think this could be quite useful for many of us and would only take a little bit of effort on our parts, just taking a couple minutes to go on if we read a book we found interesting, without it getting lost in a sea of comments or posts. Let me know what you guys think.

**TL,DR;** We should compile all the most relevant/helpful resources.

Note: I was thinking it would be especially nice if we could get a link set up on the /r/neuroscience front-page, however unfortunately I am not sufficiently skilled with computers and would not have the knowledge nor access to go about doing this. (Mods? Any advice?) In the meantime, it actually would be rather helpful if you could take a minute to: 

-post a source you think would be greatly relevant, give what type of source, possibly publication date, give the general subject, and even say what you thought of it or give a quick summary, etc. (not all of these are necessary but I thought whatever you would be able to put would be helpful)"	t5_2r3cs	True

I've been staying up reading textbooks and am pretty sure this is the field I want to work in, ideally as a researcher.

Does anybody have any advice they could give me for getting onto PhD courses in the UK? I already have a Masters in Maths (first, Oxford) but nothing that relevant. I was a lazy student in some respects since I didn't find the course too stimulating, but with this it feels like any time not learning is wasted.

I also have an offer to start a Psychology masters. It is unlikely to be directly relevant, but in the absence of something better, do you think this would give me a way into the field?
Thanks!

First, I know that NMDA channels are opened when glutamate binds to them and the neuron has been depolarized by the activity of AMPA receptors, thus removing the magnesium plug.  My question is this: if the positive magnesium ion is removed as a result of depolarization, why is it that sodium and calcium (also positive ions) rush into the neuron?  Shouldn't the depolarized voltage gradient keep them out?

My second question is more of a theory about the nature of the ""synaptic tag,"" or the mystery substance that causes LTP-related proteins and mRNA to travel only to stimulated synapses, and not unstimulated ones.  Everything I've read and been taught about this theory assumes that the ""synaptic tag"" is some sort of molecule or other substance that hasn't been discovered yet, which is produced inside stimulated synapses and has a limited duration.  However, is it possible that this ""tag"" indicates the *absence* of a substance, rather than the *presence* of a substance?  In other words, couldn't the ""tag"" be the absence of mRNA in a particular synapse as a result of it being used locally by the synapse to translate LTP-related proteins?  In this way, the newly-transcribed mRNA from the nucleus would be attracted by diffusion to the areas where mRNA density is lowest.  Am I completely off-base here, or is this plausible?"	t5_2r3cs	True

What is the term “self”? I would like to think of the “self“as something that doesn’t function when in dreamless sleep or brain death. 







Are emergent properties not alive or dead? For example the self refers to a complex set of behaviors; they are not alive, so they are not living or dead.

 





“The self” does not engage in metabolism, consumption, excretion and reproduction.
Therefore the self does not contain the behavioral criteria for life. 









What is the function of consciousness? Does consciousness just think? Does the “self” just think? What are the differences between consciousness and  the ""self""?











If the brain does not function and you define 'self' in a certain fashion, then the behaviors defined as self-do not exist. That means the definitional behaviors are absent. The self does not live or die, it is a rubric for behaviors and social conventions. 







Are there any flaws in any of the arguments about   the'""self"" not existing?

The book gives lots of examples of neuroplasticity mostly by talking about the results of various experiments.  

One part of the book I'm skeptical about is when it talks about the [Arrowsmith School](http://www.arrowsmithschool.org/) which is a school for people with learning disabilities.  

One of the techniques the school uses to build-up reading ability is to have the student wear an eye-patch over their left eye while they read.  I guess the idea is to get information to go to the left side of the brain through the right eye. But aren't both eyes wired into both sides of the brain? And wouldn't this mean that wearing an eye-patch would have no effect?

Welcome to another week of the r/neuroscience journal club. This week we will be discussing [""Sequencing the Connectome""](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001411) Submitted by /u/maximumbay. He is unable to lead the discussion this week so I will step in.

I have never studied much neuroinformatics before, so I do not know how insightful I will be. The manuscript tackles the problem, how can we more effectively create large throughput readings of neural connections. The article mention 3 current methods that are all lacking.

1. Physiological method: where researchers use laser scanning photo-simulation to determine connectivity
2. Electron Microscopy: pretty self explanatory and clearly takes a great deal of time
3. GRASP method which uses fluorescent proteins (much like Brainbow)

The manuscripts purposes a new method called 'BIONIC', where each neuron is given a small sequence of nucleotides. These sequences are then assigned barcodes, which are passed to other neurons using viruses that move genetic material across the synapse(a phenomenon I had no idea this was posible, apparently rabies does this). So these barcodes grow and grow, and you are able to see the neurons connected to a specific neuron by looking at the barcode and working backwards. The main reason why this becomes so beneficial, is because the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped DRAMATICALLY and continues each year. It seems the author is trying to take advantage of this.

The thing I like most about this manuscript is the application of critical thinking to better solve a problem. It is a very clever method to work around what becomes a difficult problem. I am a little concerned, however with the feasibility of this method. When we talk about mammalian neural networks, we start looking at big numbers, and the chance that the sequence does not get passed on increases with size. Does anyone know if this has been done successfully before?

Those are my initial thoughts and ideas about the paper. I am really excited to follow the development of this method!"	t5_2r3cs	True

So this man has a head injury from a pool accident and then claims to have instantly gained the ability to play beautiful original songs on the piano. If this is indeed the case, how could this have happen? What could have occurred in this mans brain that gave him this amazing ability that for most people takes years of practice to gain?


Creating music and musical sounds is something that humans do naturally. But the pitches the piano is tuned to and order that there arranged on the keyboard is not something we are born knowing, the neurologist in the discovery.com video I linked says its possible is something he was born with and the pool accident ""unlocked"".

Here's how I've come to understand this:

It's been explained to me that the ions didn't have to ""open every channel along the way,"" as if particles of such small mass and charge would loiter around a channel until the it opens. I thought it was too cursory and a bad way to describe it altogether. I didn't buy it.

It doesn't actually allow Na^+ to diffuse down the axon more quickly. Myelin provides insulation for the neuron preventing K^+ leakage from the axon; this keeps the membrane potential raised as the action potential reaches the next node of Ranvier. This raised potential causes a higher portion of the clustered voltage gated Na^+ to immediately, i.e. it opens the gated channels more quickly, thereby increasing signal conduction speed, open eliciting a strong Na^+ influx, strengthening the signal, allowing it to propagate further down the axon

I've hit a bit of a wall here, and I'm hoping the reddit neuroscience community can help out.  Clearly, there are plenty of posts asking about graduate school and what not.  Unfortunately, through my searches online and here, I haven't found quite the answers that I need.  I'd appreciate any input from graduates and people in the know about these things.  
  
I am trying to figure out if my GRE scores/general profile are competitive enough for the top tier schools in Neuroscience.  I'm interested in applying to Berkeley, Stanford, UCSD, MIT, and Harvard, along with a host of schools that are local to me as my safety schools.  The thing is, whenever I see a post online with someone asking if their GRE's or GPA is good enough..I don't usually have those lower scores.  I'm not sure if I'm just being neurotic over this or what, but any critiques are welcome.  
  
  
  

**My GRE score (new version, taken last year):**  
Subject:		(New)	(%)	(Old translation)  
vebral:		162	89	640  
quantitative:	163	88	780  
analytical:	5.5	96	  
  
GPA is a 3.95  
  
B.S. in Computer Science, Bioinformatics track  
B.A. in Psychology  
  
  
  

I did a senior thesis (distinction) in both schools where I did my own research with little faculty assistance. I've also been first author in a conference paper in computer science and will hopefully have another paper out in Physics at the end of this year.  
  
The thing is, none of my research is related to neuroscience directly. I did data mining research (bioinformatics and hurricane prediction) in Computer Science, astronomy research in physics, and my own research in sensory augmentation. That last one is the closest thing I have to neuroscience, and that's more cognitive science than anything else as my device that I created for the research is external/rather simple and relies more on principles I learned in psychology.  
  
  

*The biggest issue:*  
My professor told me that I should retake the GRE, but frankly I don't want to put the effort into studying extensively for the test if my profile in general is competitive with other applicants at these schools.  I have a lot of respect for my professor, so her recommendation has really been bugging me and is the reason I'm asking you all for some advice.  
  
And as an aside, should I take a GRE subject test?  I know I am highly competent in computer science and psychology, and I have a bioinformatics specialization.  I'm just not sure what could get me automatically overlooked at these top schools as some encourage subject tests but do not require the tests for admission.

1357052730.0	15rtxk	The future of neuroscience, and its growth alongside computer science?	HalfysReddit	14	8	6	"So neuroscience is something that up until fairly recently I wasn't familiar with at all.

I'm going to admit ignorance in regards to this field. What little understanding I do have comes from online articles and an innate ability for breaking down complex systems into smaller pieces.

Anyways, I'm a network engineer and general IT nerd. With my limited knowledge, I've come to the conclusion that the brain is essentially an incredibly complex organic computer (not that the brain is a CPU, it's *way* more complex). Can I get some input on that conclusion, if I'm way off base I'd like to know.

So with my limited understanding, I see no reason why one day we couldn't interface a computer directly with the human brain. Does this seem possible to you? If such an interface could ever be developed, do you imagine that the man-made computer would be most responsible for interpreting the data being communicated to/from the brain, or could we possibly develop an apparatus that the brain could ""learn"" to use, like a new sense? If such an interface was ever developed, could we possibly supplement our natural neural processing with artificial computer processing?

It would be amazing to just ""have"" a calculator built into your brain, or a way to completely alter our perception (futuristic lifelike video games come to mind). Imagine the possibilities!

I think this field is very exciting and while progress like this is a long ways off, I'd like to have some good discussion with knowledgeable people about future possibilities. Ya know, playing ""what if"".

As a network person my day-to-day work in the IT field revolves around allowing computers to talk to each other. In a way I sort of see the internet as another, non-organic but still natural, chaotic, and evolving system of communication (that's all what it all comes down to right?). Entire communities of people online interact with each other very much like the organic beings that comprise them. Are we possibly developing a worldwide ""superconscious""? Is such a thought even worth entertaining?

And let me ask you this, and honestly this probably deserves its own post but I don't want to double post (and I can't wait to have this discussion!). Say one day we completely mapped out the human brain and how it functions, if we had a level of understanding that allowed us to break down all cognitive functioning into terms of pure physics. What do you imagine would be the social/moral implications of that? Would such a level of understanding sort of ""force"" us to accept any person's actions as justified, at least within the context of their own mind? After all, the 9/11 terrorists were completely convinced that they were doing Allah's work. Hitler was completely convinced that he was improving mankind by forming a superior race. I'm not saying that these actions are at all justified, they were horrendous crimes. But I do honestly feel that even with my limited understanding, I cannot feel animosity towards them, or anyone for that matter, for any given action. Am I just being naive, or could this branch of science revolutionize mankind?"	t5_2r3cs	True

My guess is that the brain doesn't storage information per se, but that the information, depending on its type, amount of exposition of the subject to it, etc, would become part of the brain biologically, it would not so be *in* the brain, but more *become part of* the brain, if you know what I mean. 

Thought I think that makes perfect sense, as ideas aren't really things you can put in a box in your head, I've found people that think the contrary, or at least not the same as me, and I, knowing close to zero about neuroscience, don't actually know what to say (apart from my little ""information can't be stored like that!"" thing, which is more metaphysical that neuroscientific, I guess).

Help?	juggasaurus	9	4	24	"I'm a 24-year-old female who noticed slight cognitive-behavioral changes within the past year. Increased impulsivity, kleptomania for a few months (I returned it all stealthily, I have no clue why I did it), and change in my sexuality (I don't wanna go into detail here - its nothing freaky but it's not what I've been into before). 

I developed an anxiety disorder from out of nowhere about a year ago. I have a full-blown panic attack once every two weeks. I'm talking about the DSM kind of panic attack, where it strikes for no reason, I feel light-headed, a sense of dread, and a feeling that I'm having a heart attack and dying. My heart rate is consistently 95+ when it used to be 72bpm before all of these changes.

Within the past month, I've noticed that its really difficult for me to retrieve words. When I manage to say something, sometimes a word will come out that isn't what it's supposed to be at all. 

Like today, I said ""Hold on, I'm just trying to find my shoes."" When I really meant keys. My shoes were already on. Lots of examples like that but I won't go into details.

Memory issues also. I told somebody that I'd really like them to meet one of my best friends. He looked at me, shocked, because he had spent a LOT of time with her and I talk about her a fair amount. We all went on a trip together when I first met him. How could I forget that he already met her??

I'm having occasional auditory hallucinations; sounds, not voices. One visual hallucination where I swear to you I saw my phone fly across the room. I don't believe in ghosts, I also don't think this really happened. But it's what I saw. 

I've been very OCD with my thoughts lately; usually negative thoughts and ruminations from mistakes in my past that my brain has decided to throw at me from left field.

All of this is really freaking me out. I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow to try and get a referral to a neurologist. But reddit, do you have any idea what might be happening to me? I'm really scared.

UPDATE: I could only see my GP's NP, and she said I need to see a neurologist but she didn't mark it as urgent since I've been showing symptoms since a year and a half ago approximately. I disagree with her assessment, and I have an appointment with my GP on the 28th to try and urge him to expedite the process.

Basically, I had a distant relative die a few months ago from a brain tumor that grew quite rapidly. (I'm not here for sympathy, or asking why did he die, etc, I truly want scientific answers). It was quite shocking to the family, as he was fairly young (55) and extremely healthy (ran the Boston Marathon twice, most recently this past February). 

Essentially, he died within 2 or 3 weeks of getting sick. Initially, he had a bunch of mini-seizures one day, and was put in the ICU, and although he had several tests done, we did not find out that it was a brain tumor until about a week before his death. A few days after confirming tumor, he had a brain biopsy done, and although the biopsy was able to remove a small portion of the tumor, ultimately, doctors concluded that the tumor was far too large to operate on. Although he woke up from surgery, he was only awake for a few hours longer, became unconscious, and kept on life support for a day, so that family coming in from out of town had enough time to say goodbye. 

So my question(s) to you /r/neuroscience is this: If this tumor was so large, how was this healthy man able to function in his day-to-day life, without noticing anything, until he had a seizure? Would there have been any warning signs that may have occurred,  indicating that he had a tumor that he just ignored? "	t5_2r3cs	True

What I haven't heard much about is how the system impacts actual scientists (outside my little bubble), and how they feel about it. So, I have made [a brief survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;formkey=dExsRFpXbGZIV2pwa2NFejZhR2p3VEE6MQ) (about 25 multiple choice questions) just to see if there is any real consensus among the scientific community on the scholarly publishing system. This survey is NOT a real scientific survey: it is really just one curious person wanting to know a little more about other scientists in the most efficient way possible. I will not be publishing this data or using it for any scientific experiments. If I find anything interesting, and if there is any interest, I will post some of the results. 

I am sorry if this is too off-topic for this sub reddit, but I thought it would be worth a try. I am going to be cross posting this to other science-related subreddits to see if I can get some different fields' opinions.

There is lots of material about how neurons work, and there are projects that seek to create working models of groups of neurons. 

There is lots of material from fMRI scans and the like that says 'This is a region used in decision-making', 'This is a region used when we fear things' etc.

But is there a (hypothetical even) model of how the pieces all fit together? Ie - perceptions come in through the senses, then go to these areas which process them in this way then etc etc all the way to what we would recognize as human responses?

Certainly this has been done for perception to model how we perceive objects etc.

But is there a model about how we trade-off short and long-term plans, how we become jealous, how we decide whether to tell someone our secret or not?

Projects like Spaun claim that they have (or others claim that Spaun has) created a functioning model of the human brain. But they haven't - it's a model of a tiny part of it. I'm not trying to belittle the achievement, just pointing out there it doesn't model much of what we would actually recognize as being human.

Hence my question - how much does neuroscience actually know? Are there any good books that try to put the whole picture together convincingly? I'm reminded of Linus Torvalds' complaint 'Show me the code!'. Lots of people talking about what different parts of the brain 'do' but no model that links it convincingly together..?

Our psychology department is considering buying an EEG machine. The only issue is that we don't really have a neuro program here, merely a group of people that are interested in branching out into the field. I guess we're fairly certain that we want to get a dense array eeg system, but past that we're uncertain about which to choose and even what criteria we should be using. Obviously we still have a lot to learn before we make a decision, but I'd welcome any thoughts, comments, or suggestions.

The types of neural networks that are used for machine learning have no distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and their synapses can change from excitatory to inhibitory during learning.

I’m a screenwriter/filmmaker and am currently writing a screenplay that involves neuroscience. While the movie would be science fiction, I’d like to base as much of the technical elements on real science as possible. 

The story is about a couple of youngish scientists who invent artificial intelligence in their garage. Basically they invent some sort of scanning technology that they integrate into an electrorheological smart fluid which is then put into the main character’s head. Over the course of a few weeks, the fluid moves around inside his skull and brain, essentially copying it to a nearby computer (which develops into the AI). 

My questions are: 

1. Is this in any way a reasonably plausible method for such a task (even if it isn’t realistically possible). 

2. What scanning technology would they have to have to accomplish this? How small would this technology have to be able to scan?
3. What would be the best way to get the fluid into the skull? Right now we have a nasal craniotomy (if that’s a real thing), and then the computer keeps it moving around the brain to avoid getting cycled out with the CSF.
4. How much computer memory would be required to store the brain’s information (it mostly copies the neocortex as some of the more body-oriented parts don’t translate)?

Anyway, if anyone has the time and would get a kick out of supposing hypotheticals, I’d love to get a more informed opinion.

**Abstract**

Cognitive abilities and disorders unique to humans are thought to result from adaptively driven changes in brain transcriptomes, but little is known about the role of cis-regulatory changes affecting transcription start sites (TSS). Here, we mapped in human, chimpanzee, and macaque prefrontal cortex the genome-wide distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark sharply regulated at TSS, and identified 471 sequences with human-specific enrichment or depletion. Among these were 33 loci selectively methylated in neuronal but not non-neuronal chromatin from children and adults, including TSS at DPP10 (2q14.1), CNTN4 and CHL1 (3p26.3), and other neuropsychiatric susceptibility genes. Regulatory sequences at DPP10 and additional loci carried a strong footprint of hominid adaptation, including elevated nucleotide substitution rates and regulatory motifs absent in other primates (including archaic hominins), with evidence for selective pressures during more recent evolution and adaptive fixations in modern populations. Chromosome conformation capture at two neurodevelopmental disease loci, 2q14.1 and 16p11.2, revealed higher order chromatin structures resulting in physical contact of multiple human-specific H3K4me3 peaks spaced 0.5–1 Mb apart, in conjunction with a novel cis-bound antisense RNA linked to Polycomb repressor proteins and downregulated DPP10 expression. Therefore, coordinated epigenetic regulation via newly derived TSS chromatin could play an important role in the emergence of human-specific gene expression networks in brain that contribute to cognitive functions and neurological disease susceptibility in modern day humans."	t5_2r3cs	True

Assuming I am accepted to both, which programme would you recommend that I pick (with a view towards entry to a competitive PhD programme)? 

Most of the information that I can find on the internet is fairly general and/or directed at US students; there's just not very much discussion out there about the repute and rigour of undergrad neuroscience degrees in other nations. The few exchanges I could find were related to entry to graduate medicine. I know what the rankings say about both universities, but I'm also wary of placing too much weight on them.

I intend to apply for a PhD programme in the UK after graduation or try for a MSc in either Helsinki or Zurich, following which I'll apply for programmes in the US as well. Applying for programmes at Duke-NUS or NUS is also an option, but not preferred.

Any help and advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated!

**EDIT:**

I'll have been a conscript for about two years by the time I enter either, so I'm going to have accumulated a considerable amount of 'ring rust'. The University of Queensland will likely give me around 3-4 semesters' worth of exemptions for prior study, so a BBiomed with honours will take 2-3 years instead of 4. Might be a mixed blessing because of the aforementioned rust. :P

I applied to Manchester, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen via UCAS. I haven't heard back from Manchester and Edinburgh (unlikely to get in barring extreme luck because my polytechnic grades were fairly mediocre; I was an exceptionally motivated slacker) and received a rejection from Dundee (which I'm trying to ask their admissions department about), so Aberdeen is likely the one to go with for now.

I need something explained to me, something which perhaps only makes sense to me, but I have got to try.

I'm trying to be creative for a career. This involves a lot of thinking for no real good reason, i.e. no immediate reward. I feel like my brain is generally holding out on energy for these purposes. I've got a long way ahead of me as my skills gradually improve, and I need to raise my output way higher if I have any hope of gaining 'mastery'.

The reason I say what it says in the title is that I've experienced altered consciousness states where I can create for hours and hours, just rapt with all the novelty that comes out of me. I'm talking about being high.

Yes, good old weed. Why is my brain not allowing me to have the same type of manic thinking when I'm sober? Why can I only work creatively for under an hour before becoming bored when not on weed?

The issue is perhaps psychological, as the reason for my stopping is that the creative process is not satisfying my ego--the results are crap subjectively, at the moment of creation, so I'm forced to use will power. Pretty much completely the opposite when on weed. I write and I write for many hours on end until I crash, and have to go eat everything...and then next day I look at my writing and shake my head in incredulity at my own simplicity and stupidity of when I wrote it. So, obviously, writing high is not a serious option. But I do want that energy.

What does marijuana do to my brain and how can I 'release the brake' so to speak, when sober? (for the record, I'm not on it right now.) When I'm high, I pretty much always want to write, at any time of morning, day, or night, after work or before work or at work. When I'm normal, I usually want to just read when rested, and veg out when tired. I need to write, and I don't feel like making myself is the way to do it, because I quit everything that is too important to me.

I'm a very amateur neuroscience student wannabe (read: have taken one general introduction to neuroscience course) and am so incredibly fascinated by all things Nervous System related that I've spent a good portion of my summer break reading journals on the subject and researching as much as I can. However, the following statement confuses me, and I wanted to know if I have the right idea as to what it means:


From the all-knowing Wikipedia, (so again, accuracy and knowledge to be doubted):

""Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) are a class of drugs used mainly as antidepressants, but also as anxiolytics and hypnotics. They act by antagonizing serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2A and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Additionally, most also act as ?1-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The majority of the currently marketed SARIs belong to the phenylpiperazine class of compounds.""

My questions: If SARIs act to antagonize serotonin receptors, but also inhibit serotonin re-uptake, does that mean that they basically leave serotonin floating around in the synapse until they wear off? If this is the case, what purpose would they serve? How do they work to produce a hypnotic/anti-depressant effect?

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks guys! You definitely helped me figure this out :) I'm still wondering, though, how SARIs can be hypnotic. I don't understand how anything they do can lead to drowsiness. Help?

Hello,
I am suffering from homonymous hemianopsia after a bicycle accident last year. My question was, does anyone know of any research or work in the pipes that could lead to a cure for homonymous hemianopsia? I know of Visual Restoration Therapy, unfortunately I am not a good candidate for that and I've heard mixed things about the ""actual"" success of said therapy. This condition really hasn't effected my quality of life, it is really more of an annoyance. It sucks being able to only see half the world you used to see. That, and the fact that I have to pay way more attention to where I'm walking and what I'm doing all the time instead of just leisurely moving about. I got OK'd to drive so this isn't an immediate need. I'm just glad that I don't have ""Visual Neglect"". That would really suck, any help or any direction to new treatments or things that could come about in the near future is much appreciated. The internet hasn't really been much of a help. Not seeking medical advice, just any interesting news on breakthroughs or something to look forward to.

1) Consider two people getting slapped in the face and one is a masochist while the other is not, are there different processes going on in their brains even when the cause is the same? Does the masochist's brain show that he is feeling pleasure, or still pain? If he is still showing in the brain that he is feeling pain, but his behaviour is that of pleasure, and he says he is not in pain but feels pleasure, then how can that make sense from a physicalist point of view?

2) Consider again, that two children are getting their ears pierced, for instance. One child says that it didn't hurt at all, and one child is screaming and crying from the pain. What's going on in the brain? Why would one body (hypothetically) ""feel"" more pain than another when the cause is the same? Would the brain processes be different, one showing ""in more pain"" and one ""in less pain"", or would the processes be the same but perhaps it's relative - let's say the child who says the piercing didn't hurt has broken her leg before, so she is comparing getting her ears pierced to that pain, and relative to a broken leg, getting her ear pierced doesn't hurt? 

Basically I've always leaned towards a completely physicalist view, but these situations make me feel like the brain is instinctual, and we perhaps have a mind that is interpreting the brains processes, and each mind interprets processes differently. So, please show me why I'm wrong, and how I can still be a physicalist! Thanks in advance. "	t5_2r3cs	True

I have permanently lost my sense of smell from this injury as well.  I still have occasional (but much less frequent) ""thunderclap headaches"", I sometimes completely blank out mid-conversation and I often forget where I parked my car or put my keys.  The blanking out and the forgetfulness have increased 100 times in frequency since my injury, and I am 99% sure the two are related.  I also go through massive mood swings, happy one day and depressed the next, something that I did not experience prior to the injury.  

I will be as specific as I can with what happened to me, but I don't have the images.  My medical records say 14'' skull fracture, Subarachnoid hemorrhaging, and Subdural hematoma.  I was taken to the hospital 24 hours following my injury, and it was not bleeding at the time of examination (it stopped on its own).  As far as the recovery goes it was just weeks of bed rest and anti-seizure medication.  Now, 10 months later, I am playing full contact sports again.

I have read things from non-scholarly sources that say my life span could be drastically cut short, I am at a much higher risk of brain-related illness in my senior years, and my ""blanking out"" could continue to get worse and never start to get better.  Basically a lot of things I read say I am the best I will ever be now, and only slowly start to get worse.  Thoughts anybody?

It is my understanding that biofeedback, generally, has been found to be a fairly reasonable way of managing physiological responses. 

Specifically, I'm worried about the lack of a proper control in essentially all studies which I have come across -- equivalent to a sham treatment used in TMS research. While ""training your brain"" sounds very exotic, it doesn't necessarily have to be anything other than plain biofeedback.

I sustained a very bad skull fracture at the age of 7, resulting in many surgeries as my face, skull and sinuses were rebuilt. I seemed to have few residual effects from it and, owing to other traumatic family things going on at the time, the matter was left.

Now I am in my early 30's. I've never had any counseling or formal assessment of my mental processes or anything, and I'm beginning to wonder if something I thought was a character flaw isn't actually a result of my brain injury. 

(I should mention the trauma was to my frontal cortex primarily, to both hemispheres, although it was worse on my left.) 

Simply put, I'm unable to do things sometimes. And I don't mean that I don't know how or anything - I just somehow can't DO them. I'll get blocked somehow. I remember sitting there crying as a kid because I knew I should do my homework, but I couldn't seem to pick up my books and do it. I'll get ""blocked"" now on, say, cleaning my bathtub, or making a particular phone call, or even doing a tax return. Sometimes it's important things like that, sometimes it's something small, like turning on a television (I've gone weeks without tv because of this before) or picking up a dirty sock.

I know I have phobias that are related to the injury, but those I can overcome. This, however, I can't. I've been unable to hold a job for longer than six months because I get blocked at work, and eventually employers get fed up and fire me. Is there something I can do about this?

These days I am thinking of this area for my future study. First of all, I do not totally understand what neuroscience is. 

I read related Wikipedia article and [a thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/hy7kt/i_need_some_major_advice_any_neuroscientists_out/)

I kindly request some advices. Here is some explanation of myself.

I will get my bachelor's degrees in **Computer Engineering** and **Mathematics**. I am making double major. I find it fascinating to learn information from human body (or any living creature) and use this information to build a machine or adapt a machine to this idea. This information can be anything such as an estimation of which sample is dense without exact counting etc. These are charming things.

Until now, I thought (I am still thinking of course) I would focus on pure machine learning especially artificial neural network. I said pure because I would not care clinical side of my learning process. Nowadays, I read some articles, news etc, and I am thinking of neuroscience. I love Machine learning and I want to do it based-on clinical facts. Thus maybe I make a small contribution to understand the brain a little bit more.


I suppose that my interests come together in *Computational Neuroscience*.

If you still in there, here is my questions:

- Is my study area which contains no biological background a problem for neuroscience? I do not think so but I want to be sure. 

- Is it too late to jump into the neuroscience from my area? (same issue). How hard to get biological (and also psychological) background from the zero point? 

- How is the environment? Neuroscientists always study in a research lab? 

- Which countries are good at Neuroscientific study?

I have applied some PhD programs already. For example Hong Kong Polytechnic. My prospective advisor focuses on biometrics and artificial neural networks. Are these far from the neuroscience? For instance, I tend to make post-doc on computational neuroscience, biometrics does not help me?

Some quick background; I have about three years left (just transferred to a four-year university from a CC).

So, my major will be a biopsychology, which I plan to supplement with a year of bio, chem, physics. Since I work part-time to support myself while in school, it is going to take me about 3 years to make it through all my required classes plus relevant science courses. 

I just completed a summer research program in a neuro lab at one of the UC schools, which culminated in a poster presentation and it looks like authorship on a paper which will be done sometime later this year. 

My question is this: how much undergraduate research experience should I be trying to get? Would it be enough to complete summer research programs instead of volunteering in a lab during the school year (I can get 2 more in before graduation)? Given that I have to work part-time while in school, I am not sure how to fit volunteering in a lab into my schedule during the academic year.

- Personal introductions of everyone in attendance.
- Presentation by the doctor, a concussion expert, focusing on the following points:
     What is a concussion?
     Why do we need to pay attention to concussions?
     What is a general process that one might follow?

Discussion Questions
-&gt; Is this project warranted for this team?  What about for other teams?
-&gt; What role would each party be willing to take in this initiative?
-&gt; What is the best practice for evaluating an athlete during a game?
-&gt; Who should have the final say on the RTP protocol? (Day-of and long-term)

Hello,

I picked this article essentially because it is a short confirmation for the first in-vivo recordings using optogentics. The PI used a adeno-associated viral vector to insert ChR2 into the cell membrane, confirmed through the neuron's response. The advent of optogentics opens up a huge field not only by altering firing thresholds, but also because it allows a way for researcher to communicate with the cell. I would be interested to see if channel rhoddopsin could be paired to a kinase or ubiquinone to initiate inter-cellular cascades. This would be interesting because we could theoretically use light to activate or silence particular genes or even cause cell death. I am interested to see if ChR2 could be modified to respond not only to unique frequencies of wavelength, but also pulse patterns. It would be very useful to perhaps have a number of ChR2's expressed that are unique to particular stimulus. I see this being beneficial from a molecular computing perspective. In terms of discussion, here are a few questions to ponder:

* What is the future of optogentics now that in-vivo proof-in-concept studies have been completed?
* Is the vector system describe the most efficient way of inducing expression?
* What other application does optogentics allow for(I am interested particularly in creative ways)?
* Anything else you find interesting about this manuscript or method.

My basic understanding is that they pass potassium back into the cell (somewhat like a leak?) to increase intracellular charge.  What I don't understand (and this is back to the basics of APs) is why this action is necessary.  As I understand the process of an AP:

*  Stimulation occurs, Na+ channels open
*  The cell is flooded with Na+, intracellular charge rises (depolarization)
*  Shortly after, K+ gates open, and Na+ gates begin closing and enter a refractory state.
*  Intracellular charge lowers, membrane is returned to resting potential (around -70mV).


Assuming that I have the above down correctly, I'm now faced with two dilemmas.  One of which is the basic AP question below:

*  If Na+ rushing into the cell is raising intracellular charge, why does the later entrance of K+ (also a positively charged ion) *reduce* intracellular charge?

Second question, relating to ^K IR (can't make subscript here):

*  Is the function of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel to compensate for the hyperpolarization that sometimes occurs after an AP is generated?

Currently, I'm mostly interested in neuroscience as it applies to bionics, but am somewhat mutable.  I dont want to be a full time programmer, but want to learn to program whatever's needed to help future research.  I want to play with neuromodeling, but also want to learn to script things for cogsci type apps.  I want to learn Matlab, and whatever else there is to learn that applies to the topic.  I'm just starting out though, and want to make sure I install a versatile distro, and get any extra recommended packages for the venture.  If I end up deciding to change my major from neurosci to cognitive science in a year or two, in the best of all worlds my distro will follow along happily, so I wont have to reinstall and re-tweak much.

Anyone who has any opinions please list what distro you feel is best and/or recommend apps and languages that are good to learn for this field. 

It'll be on a PC based system.  I dont have hardware specs on me, but can get them later if it really matters.  It probably shouldn't though, because I'm willing to buy whatever I need to make it work within reason.

Forgive me if this isn't what you're hoping to find in this subreddit, and I'll happily take this elsewhere if need be (suggestions welcome!). I've been dating an amazing neuroscientist for about 2 years now, and our anniversary is approaching. I've looked around for a good gift, but I've not had that 'click' moment with anything that will hit the mark perfectly.

Sadly, because Etsy is powered by fallible individuals, I couldn't acquire [these beauties](http://www.etsy.com/listing/61564169/mmmmmm-brains-earrings-jewelry-handmade). But I have some hints to go on: her favorite neuroscientist is Santiago Ramon y Cajal, with a focus on his amazing illustrations of neurons (I took a look at [this](http://www.zazzle.com/ramon_y_cajal_mug-168441277648242740), but she's not much of a coffee drinker, and a mug for an anniversary seems... insufficient, reminiscent of ""#1 Dad!"" or something).

Can you make any recommendations?  A favorite book, or source of Ramon y Cajal drawings/art? Other beauties from history or the lab? She's also interested in other imaging techniques, like [Brainbow](http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/cooluses0.html) (she's already got a great Brainbow book, unfortunately for me :-p).

1332003137.0	r0xpz	Could my recent memory problems have a psychological (as opposed to neurological) origin? 	mirthquake	4	1	5	"3 months ago I experienced a ""severe"" episode of Seretonin Syndrome caused by taking prescribed Cymbalta and Tramadol together. In the weeks immediately following, my memory was severely diminished. I repeatedly forgot where I was while at work, or forgot the identity of whichever person I was speaking with, and couldn't remember my own phone number. Notions like 'numbers' and 'quantities' lost all meaning for a few days. I was confused by my computer screen.


I've since improved in significant ways, but my memory is nothing like it used to be. After a life of skillful organization and responsibility, I'm now letting plans and appointments slip, misplacing important items, failing to recall recent conversations of significance, and so on. It feels like my brain has been crippled in a specific way.


In light of quitting my job and being largely unable to make any serious commitments, my mother (who has been very close to this whole situation) is convinced that my current memory loss is psychological. My brain is unconsciously limiting itself, she thinks, as an excuse for me to eschew responsibility and live more selfishly (this isn't necessarily an accusation, since I've long been 'too' driven and tend to ignore my own needs in order to focus on those of others. She's just very concerned.)


Could she be right? I would never consciously 'allow' such a thing to happen, and I'm horribly upset about my diminished mental functioning and subsequently limited life. I believe that my weakened capabilities result from cognitive damage caused by the Seretonin Syndrome. But should I seriously consider psychology to be the/a potential culprit?"	t5_2r3cs	True

Recently I've found myself *extremely* interested in the human brain and its chemical interactions and have been contemplating taking up a career in neuroscience (notably neuropsychopharmacology).

My dilemma is that I absolutely **fucking hate** writing. You know that person in your class that always bitched an unusual amount when a research paper was assigned? He is small time. One of the reasons I desired to work in IT was because I knew I would not have to ever write anything longer than a paragraph. From what I've been told, if you're a scientist, you're going to have to publish articles about your findings if you want to succeed.

My question to you, r/neuroscience: Is there some way that I can contribute to this field without formal education (I want to avoid a several hundred page thesis paper) or without publishing journal articles on a regular basis?

2) I haven't found a textbook that discusses simple concepts like why people use certain internal solutions, borosilicate glass for their pipettes, why people use certain formulations in their aCSF, etc (while I know the answers to several of these examples, I often find they are not from the literature/textbooks but because that is what I was told without any backup. A practice I find common amongst electrophysiologists..., ""I cut the brain this way, and that's why it works.""
3) I also find textbooks lack simple technical explanations for when you're actually getting ready to do hands on work; e.g. Why do we apply a small depolarizing current when attempting to rupture the cell membrane while applying suction? Again, I would like some primary literature discussing this and/or reviews/textbooks that provide more comprehensive discussions.

I was asked to read this during a lab rotation for why we use filaments in our glass pipettes and wanted to die: http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Micropipette-Techniques-Cell-Physiology/dp/0471909521. This was WAY too technical, not to mention irrelevant given a large number of the topics discussed in the textbook are no longer used today (e.g. Using diamond dust to sharpen you pipette).

Anywho, I would greatly appreciate some direction as my PhD program does not offer an ephys course nor does it discuss the topic in any depth (we literally had 2 lectures on the entire topic across 2 years of coursework).

I would appreciate any opinions on what you all consider to be the dominant textbooks for learning extracellular and patch-clamp recording. Thank you."	t5_2r3cs	True

For example, can actions of the hippocampus affect the expression of certain proteins in the hypothalamus (ex: BDNF - brain-derived neurotrophic factor)? If BDNF levels decreased in the hippocampus, can the hippocampus signal to the hypothalamus somehow and pose a feedback effect on the hypothalamus such that BDNF levels in the hypothalamus will increase?

E_Husserl	1	0	0	"So I'm heading out to an REU for the summer on Tuesday with a lab that studies glial cells and their various awesomenesses. Anyways, as part of what I needed to do to prepare for the work, one of the post-docs in the lab sent me a selection of articles to read before I came. Just finished reading them, and this was my general impression:

After brain injury, glial cells, and astrocytes in particular, form protective boundaries around the injury keeping the damage in check and making sure it does not spread. In addition to this, these reactive astrocytes also being to dedifferentiate to a nearly progenitor or neural stem cell (NSC) like state (in vivo; in vitro, the cells can be made to completely dedifferentiate into NSCs).

Yet, it seems that with forced upregulation of specific enzymes and substances within the dedifferentiated reactive astrocytes, we can make them become completely dedifferentiated. And then, once the astrocytes have transformed into clusters of NSCs, we can force upregulate over enzymes/substances within them that cause the NSCs to become either GABAminergic or glutaminergic neurons.

Did I understand the science correctly? Are we really this close to being able to make significant strides in healing brain damage/injury patients?

I mean, it seems like we just need to have a better understanding of how exactly these processes work, and at what point in time after an injury they need to be applied. Also, there's the transition from rats to humans, and the differences there need to be understood as well.

Note: I would post links to the articles, but as they were emailed to me in pdf form, I do not have the links. Nor am I aware of the legal ramifications of if I uploaded them here. But if someone familiar with glial cells could let me know if my understanding is correct?

For me, I thought that was one of the best convention centers I've ever been in (such abundant Internet, coffee, space, and power!). They did it right. 

My favorite talk was this one: ""Selective entrainment as a mechanism for auditory selective attention."" Using ECoG, the researchers were able to detect what part of a combined auditory stimuli people were attending to (in parts of the brain other than just the auditory system!).

1. I distinctly remember breastfeeding, and because I know that I was breastfed until a normal age, I could not have been more than a year old. The most interesting thing is that not only do I remember the event, but I remember what I was thinking at the time. I remember exactly what it was like to think *without language*. I was so puzzled by how milk could get through a solid object and I imagined holes that I couldn't see as the only explanation. 

2. I remember once crawling into my parents bathroom while my mother was urinating. I was curious and I *unfortunately* decided to look and see what she was doing. I was confused by her pubic hair and why there was a string in it. I only realized 13 years later what that string actually was.
 

I'm well aware that the human mind sucks. People, and memories, are impressionable and easily manipulated, yet I remain convinced that these memories are accurate.

Gaudeamus	1	0	0	"I have been muddling through an idea for a while regarding what I call ""human experiences"" and empathy.  My idea is that there is a finite number of these experiences with a lot of variation in circumstance and probably perception.  For instance rejection by a partner, denial of a job, or being refused membership to a club are all forms of rejection (distilled, so to speak).  I had the experience of listening to a religious man talk about a gay man he knew who was despondent over being left by his partner.  Even though the religious man had similarly been left by a partner, the fact that the other man was gay prevented him from empathizing with his experience of rejection, though their stories were remarkably similar.

I brought this up to a friend who is an evolutionary anthropologist and she told me that it's not so clear cut then pointed me at this article about [denial](http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/denial-science-chris-mooney) and another about [framing](http://bigthink.com/ideas/26540).  That mixes things up quite a bit, but I am still wondering if there is something similar to my idea, anywhere in science.  I may just be googling wrong but I haven't come up with anything, though I have run across other topics of research into empathy.  I'm not a scientist, I've just come up with some ideas about communicating in a way that engages and fosters empathy (or at the very least doesn't raise anti-empathy barriers).

I'm not very well versed in comp sci.  I understand binary to mean there are only two functions... either on (1) or off (0).  No .5s, no .75s, etc.  

So with the human brain... neurons either fire (send an action potential that releases neurotransmitter) or they don't... there is no half-way or 3/4 firing.  They either do or they don't, right?

My interest is in the relationship between mental imagery and modelling and language, which naturally requires information from semantic memory, learning, and verbal language processing.  Where I'm a little foggy right now, however, is in the relationship between word-image activation and image-image activation in visual cortex.

A lot of research suggests that mental imagery is processed in prefrontal ctx, and little if any in various visual cortices.  Some research does suggest that mental imagery, as for example images projected in mind by word metaphor, heard or read, (e.g. Juliet is the sun) activates some areas of visual cortices, as if the object (sun) had been ""seen"" as a visual percept.

What my question is, for anyone who might have either an idea, specialist, or resource that may deal with language-based mental imagery and visual cortices: what are the similarities and differences between visual perception of an object as first-order stimulus and semantic word-based visualization of an object?  

I want to be able to look at the overlap, but then also take that information and use it to study associative (metaphorical) thinking."	t5_2r3cs	True

Over the last couple years I've become fascinated by cellular/molecular neuroscience and I'd like to pursue a PhD after I graduate. I have 2 summers of research experience in an immunology lab, one semester of experience in a large neuroscience lab abroad, and I will spend all of this coming academic year working on my senior thesis in a small neuroendocrinology lab at school. I don't go to a research university with lots of resources, but I'll still get to complete my own project. I think I have at least 2 strong letters of recommendation from PIs. My GPA is a 3.9.

I've been thinking about applying to PhD programs this year, but I was wondering if it might be a better career move to work as a RA in a lab for a year or two to gain more experience/narrow down my interests and motivations before applying for graduate school. For competitive programs, do you think this would make a big difference in the strength of my applications?

I'm currently working on an fMRI paradigm using Neurobs Presentation. I'm nearly finished but my trial licence, which allows me to work at home, is running out just before I finish debugging/refining my project. 

Now, until a year or so ago, you could just start a new trial licence without much hassle (a quick windows reinstall would suffice), and remain working (without much need for pantaloons).

However, the clever people at Neurobs seems to have found a way to prevent this. They log something, the mac-address, some hardware information maybe? I'm at a loss. 

I'm pretty sure I've ran a trial licence before on this particular hardware configuration (minus my new hd) which is running the current trial, so I  *think* it might have something to do with the HD, or a reinstall of windows + the new hd. I'm not sure.

Has anyone found a way around this problem (e.g. found a way to circumvent the trial-renewal block)? Even sharing a hunch would be good at this point. 

I'd not mind spending a small amount on a spare hd to avoid a commute/lack of comfort just this once. 

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: Does anybody know how to activate a Neurobs Presentation trial licence more than once? "	t5_2r3cs	True
1343791683.0	xhjlj	Free Will: Does it really exist?	Panthios	4	5	20	"I feel that our brains are a mechanism; a biological device that computes logical patterns based on all available input. I have started to think free will is kind of an illusion. That an outcome of a choice is ALWAYS determined on the elements leading up to that choice, including past experiences, mood, chemical imbalances, hormone levels, temperature. I imagine it as a large mathematical equation; given if all the variables are the same, then the choice or outcome will be the same.

Example:
Give a person 1000 dollars, take them to the mall and let them go shopping, they must spend it all. Common ideology would say that their free will would determine what to buy. After they are done spending all the money we redo that scenario.

But here is the kicker, we REVERSE TIME to the point they walked into that mall. Everything in the cosmos is IDENTICAL to the first time they went in. They don't even have the memory of spending the money originally so to them its their first time through.

I feel that if time was reversed and everything was exactly the same, they would make the exact same choices. This gives me the idea that our choices are not a random event but an outcome to a complex set of universal variables.

When you have a choice between pizza and cinnamon toast crunch, you can say well I have a free will to choose either one, but ultimately your end choice will always be that choice given the variable leading up to it. (past experiences with both, your mood, how long its been since you had either, want hot or cold food, the smell) because as you know from neurology, your past experiences and memories are stored in neuron pathways and those pathways are always taken into account when a choice is made subconsciously or consciously.

That is my take on it...

I'm a CS grad student working on a project for real-time systems.  Embedded systems and whatnot, hard and soft deadlines, etc.  Probably not too interesting to you guys, but still.  My group is working on a helmet that has an accelerometer and a wireless transmitter within.  When a person gets hit (such as a football player on the line of scrimmage), it crunches the data from the accelerometer to determine if there was possible concussive injury.  We'd heard of some studies that indicated that minor trauma over a period of time can be just as threatening as a single major trauma, so we also intend to keep a history of impacts with the helmet.  There will be a data API that will allow the coach, fieldside medic, and whoever else needs it to be able to access the data.

Now, the thing that we're actually having issues with is how to determine whether a ""hit"" is actually dangerous or not.  My group member talked to a friend of his who is in this field, but all he could get out of him is ""impacts to the head are bad"".  We need to know the severity of impacts to worry about, what kind of acceleration to be concerned over (simple linear shock, rotational shock, etc.), and really whatever else we can get from this.

(Advice)	genodemax	1	2	7	"Just to give you some background, I recently graduated with my Bachelor's and will be entering a Master's program this fall on a Fulbright grant. The problem I have is that my undergraduate area of study was focused on issues in the humanities. When I first started, the areas in which I was most interested were English and Philosophy, so that's what I double majored in. However, as time progressed to the point where I am now, I've become more and more interested in issues relating to neuroscience (sob story as well: a friend of mine was severely brain-damaged in a car accident a little while ago and her experience has made me want to study the brain in a more scientific manner, rather than merely philosophize about it). I’ve managed to engineer my humanities research in both English and Philosophy into areas relating to cognition; for example, I’ve studied a great deal in linguistics in the English department and have taken up philosophy of mind as my main area of focus in philosophy (if I manage to get into neuroscience, the area I specifically want to focus on is the relationship between language and cognition). The Master’s program I’ll be attending in the fall is in philosophy, but it’s specifically in philosophy of mind, and from the looks of it I’ll have opportunity to integrate areas such as linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience into my research. So, I basically have a pretty solid academic corpus in theoretical issues involving the mind and language.

The biggest problem I foresee is that my double major in two Humanities-based disciplines have left me relatively lacking in any academic coursework in the hard sciences or mathematics. The only science course I’ve taken thus far was an astronomy class I got a ‘C’ in. I’ve never actually taken any calculus classes—I fulfilled the math requirement with a class in Statistics (which I did manage to get an ‘A’ in). 

I’ve been told research experience is highly preferable in neuroscience admissions. I DO have research experience, but none of it is really in anything hard science-y. My research thus far is mainly in computer science/linguistics and psychology. In the Master’s program I’ll be attending it looks like I’ll have ample opportunity to do research in things like psycholinguistics and cognitive science. 

My undergraduate GPA was very high (3.91) and like I said when I apply for a Ph.D. program in two years I’ll have a Master’s from a Fulbright grant, and I’ll have been studying things relevant to what I want to do in neuroscience. I’m worried, however, that the lack of math/hard science in my record will quarantine me from any programs. Since I just graduated, it’s too late for me to take any classes for academic credit. I do have a few months before I leave for grad school. Does anyone have any advice on what I can/should do to make myself more appealing and more prepared for a neuroscience Ph.D program in two years? Any specific ideas on how I can possibly get neuroscience-specific research under my belt in the few months I have free?

Thanks for any feedback!

Tl;dr want to go into a neuroscience Ph.D program in two years, studied mind-relevant humanities stuff as an undergrad, lack math and science background, want to know what I can do.

I have permanently lost my sense of smell, among other side effects (occasional twitching, memory loss, thunderclap headaches) but something new started happening very recently.

I work out a lot.  This TBI only increased my desire to spend a lot of my free time at the gym as it has made me very angry.  Whenever I workout (this has happened for a long time) or get physically exhausted I can smell/taste the same distinct thing (phantosmia).  I can't really explain what it is, but it is the same, every single time I get tired (for the past year).  What started happening very recently though is a weird sensation I get on my tongue when I am excited or startled.  Think of any type of event that would give you ""butterflies"" for a brief second.  Something jumping out from behind a door at me, or seeing I got a 100% on an exam I was worried about, or hearing a relative has cancer, anything that can ""rustle your jimmies"", gives me a ""pins and needles"" feeling in my tongue.  It feels like there is something inside my tongue trying to permeate its way through the pores and it is somewhat painful.  Like when you get that pins and needles feeling in your foot if your leg falls asleep.

It is weird and it literally happens any time I get startled or excited in an instant.  Sometimes it actually hurts pretty badly.  Is this from my brain injury?  And has anybody ever heard of this before?

Real [mind control](http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html)&amp;nbsp;involves the activation and suppression of action potentials, the firing of an individual neuron, in a pattern which creates a real effect in the brain of humans. &amp;nbsp;It can so [subtle, you might not even notice it happening to you.](http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html)&amp;nbsp; Neurons fire in patterns, and in groups, and the result of these firing patterns is thoughts, feelings, movements, etc. &amp;nbsp;It is scientifically possible to cause these firing patterns to be activated remotely, without the use of an implant, by ""injecting"" electricity into individual neurons using advanced technology. 

  

This is done by teleporting charge via entanglement, something that has been alluded to in recently [published](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0896v2.pdf) [research](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/1878491_Proposal_for_teleportation_of_charge_qubits_via_superradiance).   

  

For the last 5 decades, U.S. intelligence has done a significant amount of research and development into a technology called ""[TEMPEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename)."" &amp;nbsp;This technology was originally used in order to reconstruct usable information from monitors, integrated circuits, etc in order to remotely surveil electronic devices. &amp;nbsp;Later, technology was developed which was able to do the **reverse**, and cause these machines to act in a certain manner.

  

Human brains are, for all intents and purposes purposes, advanced computers whose mechanism of action is the product of electrical impulses, and the technology surrounding ""TEMPEST"" could be modified to take control of, and remotely surveil the thoughts and feelings of human beings.

**How I know about mind control.**
 This is a work in progress, updated daily. &amp;nbsp;It is a personal story of Illuminati mind control, gang-stalking, psycho-surveillance, and general weirdness. &amp;nbsp;It takes you through the story of events that occurred between 2010 and 2011, and describes my inner thoughts and interaction with the dark force shaping the future of humanity. &amp;nbsp;I believe this force to be older than humanity, unearthly, and directly responsible for many religious phenomenon throughout our history. &amp;nbsp; It is also current engaging world governments, intelligence agencies, and organized crime in a conspiracy designed to fulfill the prophesy of Revelation.&amp;nbsp;

No, she's the lady friend of a chap I went to uni with."	t5_2r3cs	True
