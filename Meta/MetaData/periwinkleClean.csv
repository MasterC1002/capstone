Believe me, I who am speaking to you with full knowledge of the facts, and who tell you nothing is lost in Periwinkle. The same means that overcame us can bring us victory one day. This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not over as a result of the Battle for April 1st. This war is a worldwide war. All the mistakes, all the delays, all the suffering, do not alter the fact that there are, in the world, all the means to crush our enemies one day. Vanquished today by mechanical force, in the future we will be able to overcome by a superior mechanical force. The fate of our color depends on it! We shall rise!

Just as I have foreseen, on the 1 week anniversary of the unjust Battle of All Fools Day, brave soldiers of the Periwinkle Clan have struck back at the enemy! They have planted three flags in enemy territories and on the Field of Karmic Glory.  Now is our chance to strike back at them! Upvote! Upvote and screencapture when our logo waves over top of all three of these subreddits!  Do not stop until we are victorious!

Also, do not doubt our enemy’s resolve to counterattack! Keep watch of our ancestral homeland /r/Periwinkle and our camp here at /r/Periwinkle_Clan. They will try to strike back, don’t let them!

May the blessed Periwinkle light shine brightly upon us and lead us to victory over the Orangered Menace! And forget not the sacrifices of the flag bearers who gave their lives for the Periwinkle Nation! Theirs are only the first casualties in this war!  Fight on, my brothers and sisters! To victory!

EXCELSIOR!

Here's what I've got so far:

2 teams, masterrace periwinkle and scumbag orangered.

Every upvote increases one team's score. (Not sure if true)

You randomly get weapons and hats by browsing around Reddit. The hats are stylish but do nothing but add up by your username. The weapons can be used on scumbag orangereds to mess with their posts and add stuff like TOM CRUISE etc...

The battle is apex at the original blog post, but it covers the whole of reddit. Go fight everywhere.

When the points at the bottom hit a max, one team wins. (Maybe 10000?) We're currently losing, so go FIGHT.

1364839838.0	1bfptw	This is the Official Item Description Thread, Please Upvote.	Ciznit	53	10	24	"**Important Information:** This is coming from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/1bg6am/psa_the_battle_is_not_based_on_votes_its_based_on/) link over in /r/FieldOfKarmicGlory.  Weapons and healing items are the only things that affect score, upvoting/downvoting does nothing.  Also, the rate at which you obtain drops is relative to you're activity posting links and comments (maybe other things as well) although again, up/down voting does nothing.


I'm going to watch the combat log and try to figure out how each item affects our points along with any effects they might have on the user its used against.  If you know what the special effects of any of the items are, post it below and I'll add to the list in the top post.


**HATS (Don't affect score, ~~do~~ may affect wearer):** 

Cirque du Hat 

Computerized Cranial Cooling Cap 

Dapper 'Dora

Incredibly Stupid Hat of Stupidity - gives stupid spelling errors ('too' instead of 'to') etc.

The Jack Kelly 

Royal Hat of Silliness 

Amorous Vomitor 

Ass Hat

Ho Ho Hat

Fightin' Francis

The Great Protector

Mr. Banana Graber

Purest Ring of Abstain-ence - User with this in their possession can't vote.

Freaky Red Fungus

Snoo's Scalp

Just a Block of Cheese

Soldier's Steel

Safety First!

Vlad the Impaler

I'm Eggscellent - is missing it's cursor text

Vulcan Phonic Receptors

Yer a Wizard!

Abrahat Lincoln

World's Greatest Trucker

Nefarious Nimbus - ~~I think this may disable the target's ability to receive weapons, I haven't gotten a weapon in about 40 minutes since someone gave me one~~ I'm starting to think that hats don't have effects and the effects I thought I saw them having were due to simultaneous weapon uses against me.

*Note: ~~There is one hat who's silhouette is similar to The Jack Kelly, but doesn't have any flavor text when you hover your mouse over it.  If anyone knows the name of this hat please let me know~~ The hat is called I'm Eggscellent*


**WEAPONS (If its in bold, then its special):**

**Wistful Panpie Melodies (+2 to target's team)** - clears one (maybe multiple) negative effects from target

Distinguished Medal of Something Significant (+1)

Smoke Bomb of Vague Shrouding (+3)

Indiscriminate Scattergun of Emphasis (+1) - makes random words bold in post

Clumsy Mallet of Inebriation (+1)

Hackneyed Crossbow of Memetic Torpor (+1)

Mighty Megaphone of Internet Intolerance (+3)

Scimitar of Chirality (+1)

Moldy Boots of Nostalgia (+2)

Inneffective Siege Tower of Rampart Surmounting (+2)

Pokey Stick of Social Capitulation (+1)

Mirrored Shield of Palindromic Failure (+2)

Jumbled Tome of Significance Shuffling (+2)

Crude Hatchet of Paragraphical Indifference (+2)

Dastardly Knuckles (+2)

Redacting Tape of Patriotism (+1)

**Mine of Propinquity (+4 to the *user's* team)** - like the caltrops, this weapon can strike links mulitple times.  I'm not sure what the trigger is (visiting it maybe?) The target of these can be from either team.  My best guess is to save these for top posts in /r/rising

Magnet of Un-Magnanimity (+2)

Wand of Cursory Gestures (+2)

**Pointy Dagger of Mortal Strike (+4)** - Removes all items and effects from your target.

Sizable Claymore of Compensation (+3)

**Spiney Caltrops of the Spineless (+2, can be to either team)** - this weapon can strike links mulitple times.  I'm not sure what the trigger is (visiting it maybe?)  I would hold off using these for now as it isn't clear how points are distributed from this weapon.

**Royal Sceptor of the Queen's English (+1)** - ~~from the description it sounds like if we use this weapon on an orangered that it may give them access to this subreddit, we should withhold using it until this can be confirmed.~~  We can now enter each other's subreddits so now this point is moot, just use it on the orangered menace.

**Huge Syringe of Soothing Panacea (+2 to target's team)** - heals target of 1 affliction


**Edit:** There is another item thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/periwinkle/comments/1bfwu7/list_of_weapons_and_how_they_affect_points_please/).

**Edit2:** ~~ORANGERED ARE PLANNING TO STRIKE AT 3:00PM CENTRAL TIME!

The destruction of the Orangereds must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Orangreds.

As you may or may not know, the Periwinkle family were a respected branch of the British royal institution until that bloody Sir Dimble Periwinkle decided to urinate on one of my mother's corgis. 

However in light of this new worldwide war, we've decided to let bygones be bygones and would like to extend our message of support to all of those fighting under the Periwinkle banner.

Us Brits will be offering you our stiff upper-lip, our charming accent and gallons of glorious tea to aid you in the upcoming conflict. Although it is   a crying shame it's not against those ruddy Germans across the pond.

Finally I would like to request that Prince Periwinkle IV returns my bone china tea-strainer - Her majesty is ""fucking parched."" "	t5_2v06p	True

We won another territory today! /r/RaidersPinnacle. This was my first battle, and it was amazing! Battle tactics and skirmishes everywhere.

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/) shows the skirmish scores. Woohoo! We totally beat those ORs.

And thanks to my fellow Periwinkles for supporting [my attack!](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/cb2hqs5) Guess what my attack totaled?

&gt; **Skirmish #116 - the victor is Periwinkle by 600 for 143 VP**

That's right - 600 troops! And it kept under the radar the WHOLE time! This is thanks to my fellow Periwinkles for supporting and keeping it quiet!

Imagine if I was an OR. They would have [made me supreme overlord](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaidersPinnacle/comments/1i9afe/invasion_the_orangered_armies_march/cb2pe9h) for that skirmish. But NEVER. Periwinkle blue is where I belong.

Better luck next time, Orangereds!

Or should I say, *Better dead than Orangered*.

Dominoed out!

The Chroma Wars are, at their essential core, a grand and glorified game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; the categories have just been renamed.

*Infantry*, best represented by images of soldiers, are the base class. [Here is an example of a soldier](http://www.liquidmatrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/blackwater_mercenaries.jpg).

*Ranged* units are best represented as marksmen, artillery, and the like. [Here is an example of a sniper](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4VocvaV2hEM/TtYErJkjMEI/AAAAAAAAtZA/vEKg9Gf8en0/s1600/sniper03.jpg).

*Cavalry*, well-represented as Polish Hussars, tank formations, or even bombers are the third class. [Here is an example of a Cavalry unit](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/US_Navy_090711-N-9712C-011_Two_F-A-18_Hornets_assigned_to_Strike_Fighter_Squadron_%28VFA%29_204_and_two_F-15_Strike_Eagles_assigned_to_the_Louisiana_Air_National_Guard_159th_Fighter_Wing_fly_in_an_echelon_formation.jpg).

Just like rock, paper, scissors, each unit is balanced to beat another.

**Infanty beats Cavalry.**   
**Cavalry beats Ranged.**   
**Ranged beats Infantry.**

In order to win, your team does not need the highest-voted post: *your highest-voted post must beat the opponents' highest-rated post.*

For example- if our highest-rated is Infantry and theirs is Cavalry, we win. If ours is Infantry and theirs is Ranged, they win.

_____

So, the burning question- **how do we ensure our victory?**

Simply put- with determination.

Periwinkle War Leaders, including myself, will make regular posts providing instructions for the current phase, namely which post (or posts) to upvote, and which to downvote.

*DO NOT UPVOTE EVERYTHING PERIWINKLE, OR DOWNVOTE EVERYTHING ORANGERED.** This will not help us. We need to up vote the Orangered post that is vulnerable to our current leading Periwinkle post, and down vote the others. Likewise, we up vote the currently-winning type of Periwinkle posts and down vote the others.

Check back for regular instructions, closely follow the advice of your War Leaders, and we Periwinkles will sweep the battle!

**IN THE EVENT OF A LATE-GAME EMERGENCY**

If, at the end we need a hail-mary strategy, the moderation staff will let present you with a set of instructions; usually, it will be a link to one specific post that needs upvoting, and advice to downvote everything that post is weak towards."	t5_2v06p	True

There is something going down in /r/fortlapis right now, we have reporters on their way, and will get you more information as it happens.

---

**UPDATE 1**: The renegade Periwinkle territory of Fort Lapis was besieged by Periwinkle Spec Ops today in an all out war. Most of the buildings and infrastructure was destroyed in the initial bombings and shellings.

---

**Update 2**: The emergency response team lead by /u/Ghost_of_onyx is leading the [**evacuation**](http://www.reddit.com/r/FortLapis/comments/1is3l2/periwinkle_ert_emergency_response_team_inbound/) effort of Periwinkle Aligned Resistance fighters against the Mutinous teritory. 

---

**Update 3**: /r/GoodMorningPeriwinkle News Has interviewed /u/Ghost_of_Onyx, who had this to say:

&gt;There has been a series of explosive devices detonated in and around the territory... we aren't going to be pointing too many fingers until the investigation has progressed, but it is believed to be the work of fringe groups with ties to the Orangereds.

At this point there is much speculation, but this is the current official word.

**Update 3.5**: Ghost_of_Onyx also had this to say:

&gt;We also ask non-military personnel and those who are not emergency responders to stay clear of initial blast areas... prayers are welcome.

There is already enough proof of this, as stated in several posts before me. I would of assumed that this is not allowed, but I suppose this is not the case.

* This year, the gag is that Reddit is turning into an online game where two teams fight each other. You are on team periwinkle. The other team is orangered.

* The scores at the bottom of the screen are the team points. We get points when we use weapons (sticks, missiles, hammers, etc.) against the orangered team. We lose points when someone from **either** team uses a weapon against us. That includes us - so watch out for friendly fire.

* The weapons mess up the text of people's comments in a variety of ways.  You'll start to see the patterns after a time.

* *Edit: [Definitive Item List](http://www.reddit.com/r/periwinkle/comments/1bflvs/definitive_item_list/)*

* Hats are hats. They appear over your username. They do not give us points. But some of them look pretty cool.

* The servers have been slammed, so everything is slow. 

* There are orangered spies about trying to deceive us. Do not believe their lies. They are also attacking are most informational posts. Panpipes can be used to counter the effects of weapons.

* Edit: as per [the new addendum to the rules here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FieldOfKarmicGlory/comments/1beq5p/the_rules_of_battle/), upvoting periwinkle or downvoting orangered does not do anything. The only clear way to gain points is to use a weapon against the enemy.  Note that the guy who posted the rules is a dastardly orangered - so if we lose, we'll know why.

* This will all be gone tomorrow. But today, we battle.  Good luck, and redditspeed. "	t5_2v06p	True

This was found by heading to /r/FortLapis and scanning the flag, which is a QR code. The code gives base 64 encoded text (thanks to an anonymous tip giver for this help), which, when decoded, reveals the URL http://imgur.com/a/N1XGs, which leads to another QR code, which reveals a URL leading to http://imgur.com/a/NBL4M. 721 makes sense being the first code, since 7/21 is when it all started.

**Piece II** Credit to /u/FlynnRock. A second piece of the code has surfaced! On the /r/FortLapis page, a picture of of a bomb disposal kit has appeared - it leads to this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8a_VSNv74I. It reviews documents relating to the Fort Lapis crisis, including a new piece - a QR code. Scanning it, gives a base 64 text (just like the first) that leads to thisurl: http://imgur.com/a/vTsRa , who's QR code leads.. to this: http://imgur.com/AhWAKQi. 539 is the second piece. We have to keep digging!!

**Piece III** 483. The same methodology as the others, starting from [this](http://redd.it/1j4jey) post. The trail leads [here](http://imgur.com/a/Sax8l).

This means the whole code should be 721-539-483

1374720234.0	1j02zs	[OFFICIAL] The State of Fort Lapis, and an Official Statement on the Matter to date. Please Read.	tiercel	29	10	10	"People of the Kingdom of Periwinkle. It is time that I finally inform you of the status we find ourselves in currently. Till now, I busied myself with efforts to avoid any further death and destruction, keeping diplomatic lines open and working in secret to talk to those who would wish our people harm through intermediaries. However, the impasse we are currently at offers me no solution I can help achieve with my words. So, as my last act of solution, I am spelling out what has lead us to today, so that you will understand my necessity for my next and likely final decision in this matter.

As we were waged in a brutal, yet efficient battle with the Orangereds over the future of the land of Nordwalder this past Sunday, our PBI (Periwinkle Bureau of Investigation) began relaying strange reports of activity which was initially dismissed as bad intel. We assumed the mentions of Fort Lapis to be errors in translation, because all enemy activity was known to be in Nordwalder. It was not until the radio reports from Good Morning Periwinkle started coming in, describing carnage in that land, that we realized the folly of our assumptions. The land of Fort Lapis has been lightly settled for some time, and often found cause to be diplomatically difficult, but was still a firm part of the Periwinkle Kingdom. It's Governor, /u/spiffersthegreat, had been appointed his position in a move to unify different voices in the early Periwinkle Kingdom, and his Lt Governor, /u/artificialsanity, assigned to balance this power. I tell you this to help you understand why we always dismissed the difficulties of diplomacy in that land (as we wanted time to heal those early wounds of ideological disagreement), and why we still felt confident in its future. 

That all changed this past Sunday afternoon. Due to some earlier trade reports that showed some missing arms shipments into Nordwalder, agents of the NPP (New Periwinkle Party, a group dedicated to the Periwinkle cause of expansion and the Five Petals) scheduled a meeting in the Governor's Mansion to discuss security along the trade routes. It is from the beginning of this meeting that we have pieced together the following intel. As the meeting began, the Governor, who was supposed to be present, had an engagement come up, and had to delay the meeting. In this delay, the mansion fell prey to a well-placed bomb blast. Satellite imagery shows that the bomb originated from deep within the mansion, not the exterior. This bomb was cleared through security, and placed deliberately. The entirety of the NPP at that meeting is assumed dead. The Governor, who had “miraculously” escaped harm though convenient timing, and his security forces were unharmed in the blast. Immediately after, a bomb detonated outside the main NPP Bureau office, right next to a Hotel (which caused our initial confusion as to the targets, since diplomats were also in town and staying at the Hotel), and inflicted severe casualties. The carnage had just begun.

The Governor, a past friend of the PRP (People's Republic of Periwinkle), had secretly built the fringe group into a raging force in that land. Internal reports as to the sickness of the Lt. Governor these past months are assumed to be a farce, since no known contact with him can be verified during that time, and it is assumed he was assassinated in a consolidation of power before the land went diplomatically quiet. The growth of the PRP in Fort Lapis had spread like a cancer, and it was being fueled by the one man who could have prevented all of this. Spiffers had not only gone rogue, but he had built an army to carry out his twisted ideas.

It was several hours and many more targeted blasts, most near home of known NPP agents in Fort Lapis, before we had boots on the ground. The focus of their efforts was initially rescue and aid, as there were many innocents caught in the crossfire of these acts. While our forces established a perimeter around the city, inside those NPP agents not already extinguished took up arms, along with sympathetic Periwinkle guardsmen and volunteers, and fought back against the insurgents whom had effectively cut off the land and taken it under their control. It was the assurances of Spiffers, the Governor, which delayed action into the city, kept the true nature of the cause, that being the rise of the PRP, from being determined, and cost so many innocents their lives.

While the time from that point has been filled with my own constant attempts to get through to a man I once considered a friend, I am sorry to say those talks have ended. I won't go into all the details of what happened during those days at this point because I don't want to disrespect the dead with senseless idealistic talk and politics. What you need to know is that, I could not do anything to stop this violence with those methods, and [as this final missive from Spiffers to myself shows, the time for talk is now over.](http://imgur.com/Zjx1gTd)

Our intel shows further atrocities being perpetrated in the city now, all at the hands of the PRP. They have cut off the access of the press, and even arrested some. There are confirmed photos of torture, assassinations, and interrogations. There are bodies piling up in the streets. There are systematic roundups being conducted for those who cannot escape. There are too few left to rebel inside the city. We must change the narrative of this horror.

I have assigned for a Special Force to be formed to carry out the operation of rescue, recovery, and liberation of Fort Lapis. As I have stated, the time for talk is done. We urge those holding out there to continue resisting, and know that help is now being brought into that land. After this press release hits the airwaves, that Task Force, Strike Force: Vinca, will be making their way into the city. May the Holy Light of Periwinkle go with them, for their mission is one I'd never have thought possible for me to give... taking up arms against Periwinkles, regardless if they have forgotten that fact themselves. 

I will follow up with the Kingdom once this operation goes into effect. We will succeed, because there is no other option.

Thank you, and may the Five Petals bless us all. "	t5_2v06p	True

We Periwinkle are a forgiving people and accept everyone who wishes to walk in the glory of the Holy Periwinkle Light.  But before one can commune with the Light of Periwinkle, one must be absolved of their past orangered sins and be born again as Periwinkle.

Our friendship is not decided by a mere colour, dictated to us by those above, but by the sacred bonds we have developed since time began! This battle has caused the loss of many once fruitful lives and shattered those of the innocent. We have torn brothers from their sisters arms and pitted them against eachother in what scholars, years from now, will look on with pity.

There must be some among you of the same mind. We cannot leave a land, destroyed by the lust for imaginary internet points, to our followers! Such is not the way of the humble Redditor. Gone will be the times when a man of any origin may come freely to gain and lose karma. So come, come my brothers and sisters! Lay down your arms and fashionable hats! Put an end to this madness, because someone has to. Someone's got to take a stand, and refuse to fight.

The oppressive rule of Orangered will surely sicken the people just as it will poison the harbors of that great port. As your comrade I ask you, will we allow those beautiful shores to be marred by the disgusting visage of an Orangered banner? Will we idly stand by while our enemies burn the Petals of our nation? 

No, brethren, we will not. In two days time our faith will be challenged. 

We will rise to meet that challenge with a Passion burning brighter than the sunrise breaking over the horizon in the distance, with the true, transforming inner Peace that is known only to Periwinkle, with Perseverance comparable only to the relentless waves of that elder ocean breaking endlessly onto land, with graceful Principle guiding our hearts, and absolute, unyielding Purpose guiding our hands. 

The Orangered will be defeated, because the Petals give us strength. As long as we hold fast to our core, failure is not possible.
