Burn Notice has been shooting in the condemned Coconut Grove Convention center for 6 years, renting an otherwise useless building from the City and in return paying them almost a quarter of a million dollars a year to lease the convention center as their stage.


The City of Coconut Grove thinks that Burn Notice is holding back the city from it's true potential and think that space would better be used as a park which ""would draw tourists"" and improve Coconut Grove. 

So the plan of the City of Miami commissioners is to NOT RENEW the lease for Burn Notice, tear down the building, and make it a park.

For those not familiar with the area, there are 3 parks located within about a mile and a half.

**The production company has said that it is cost prohibitive to move the show from this spot which could affect the future of the show**, and this decision will have a serious negative impact on the future of film and TV production in South Florida. 


Burn Notice and its parent company, TVM Productions, employ hundreds of South Floridians who want to see it stay on the air and in Florida!

Let me remind you that the city of Miami has no money, and that they are using tax payer dollars to demolish a site where money comes in from film.**

Let me start off by saying I live in Miami, and I know too many people to count that work in (and connected to) the local film industry. Although I don't work on Burn Notice, I've known some of the crew my entire life.

Burn notice uses the city of Miami former (old) convention center as it's main stage. Most of the interior shots are filmed there, such as Madeline's house, and Michael's apartment. The problem is, the city of Miami is corrupt, and ignorant. They don't get anything done done that is productive, and their film commissioner is an absolute imbecile.

The decision has been made to kick burn notice out of the convention center, which by the way has had no other use since before 2007. Many in politics and in production have urged for the council not to go through with their plan but to no avail. Even the county in which the city is in (Miami-Dade) tried to stop the decision.

What this means for the show: Although burn notice has maybe one or two more seasons left, the set back could hurt production and end it much sooner than planned, or they might move to another area which wouldn't fare well for the industry down here.

Currently I don't know (or forgot) why the decision was made, or even brought up, but I will get the info by tomorrow.

[spoiler](#s ""That scene at the of end of the ""Forget Me Not"" episode, where she kisses him on the cheek and he remembers it being a kiss of goodbye instead of a kiss of love, is so strong that I think its a great way to end their relationship."")

In my opinion they have always been great as a team but never in a relationship, their romance has been an annoyance to me on the show, because they both want completely different things.  I feel that its set up that they will always have a mutual love and respect but never in a romantic way and 
 [spoiler](#s ""I was excited that they decided to show that ending to their romantic relationship.  If it truly is the end."")

 I think the real relationship he needs to mend or at least work for is his mother and take some time to look after his nephew.

It was great getting some insight into why Michael does what he does - what motivates him. Especially hearing him say it in his own words (though Anson may have forced him to admit it). I think Anson's reason for coming along and ""asking questions"" was not because he didn't know the answers - after all, he knows Michael better than Michael knows himself - but to make Michael admit the truth to himself.

Loved the return of Beatriz (Ilza Rosario) from ""The Fall of Sam Axe""! Glad to see she's grown up into a fine (if risk-taking) young woman. Also liked Mark Ivanir's and Simon Kassianides' characters (Ivan the Russian handler and George Anders, respectively).

The ""job"" in the Caymans wasn't so interesting this week, though I guess it sets Anson up with the resources to do something really evil.

Anson's confrontation with Michael about his father was... tense. I was expecting Mike to punch him (I'm hoping he'll get the chance eventually, before any shooting/arresting occurs). I also want to see more about Mike's past.

And Sam's getting investigated! D: I'm guessing this'll sort of take him ""out of commission"" with him probably having to stay out of Mike's work for the moment.

Michael gets cleared of Max's murder by Tavian quite early on, making it obvious that someone much bigger is going to get him in some serious shit (particularly obvious when the villain-dude kills himself). It's so much worse when you *know* what's coming but you can't really do anything to stop it.

Larry's reappearance seemed a bit... I dunno, odd, at first, because he didn't seem like he'd be the true villain behind everything (though he does have a penchant for messing with Michael's life). Another reason I suspected Anson was the true villain. Quite a revelation that Michael covered up a murder by Larry as part of the job. Guess they weren't all that different after all – at least at one point. (The pause before he said ""I didn't do anything in Chechnya"" said volumes.)

I suspected Anson a tiny bit right from the start, especially after the ""wife"" had already been killed long before the job was over.

For all the trigger-happiness Fiona's shown so far, she really takes it hard when someone actually innocent dies, especially when it's (she thinks) by her hand.

You can see the stuff Anson says – particularly his mentioning that Mike's mom talked to him (and what she said about his dad) – is really getting to Michael. I'm surprised he hasn't punched Anson yet. A good bit of exposition and history tied up by Anson's dialogue though: why Michael was burned, and who's been behind all the crap he's dealt with so far. [insert *so much rage* at Anson]

(...I just realized that Anson *knew* Michael would let him escape, and lead him to Sam and Fi, just because he knew Mike's thought process so well.)

I can't wait for November and the rest of the season. Anson's in for an ass-kicking come the true season finale. (Hopefully Michael comes clean to her about Anson early in the season. He needs to stop having such trust issues. Though Anson might be listening in or something.)

He's smart, smug, evil and the apparent level of obsession he had with Michael was fun to watch.  The comedy he liked to employ during jobs was also part of his charm for me.

Some of my favorite Brennen moments:

""People will go on killing each other in little wars all over the globe whether or not you steal it. The only difference is how much money I make while they do it.""


MW: ""You're forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer?""

TB: ""Forcing. Such an ugly word. Encouraging? Incentivizing? No, you're right. Let's go with forcing.""


""A good general is only as strong as his weakest soldier. And a great general doesn't have any weak soldiers.""


""You didn't beat me Michael.""


TB: ""Did you get all that, am I talking to fast for you?""

SA: ""Don't take my silence for confusion Brennen, I'm just trying to kill you with my eyes""

TB: ""Ok ...""


""By the way, how's Nate?  I sent him a christmas card, but I never heard back from him.""


Larry was a close second for me, and Bly was pretty entertaining, just sloppy.  Strickler was pretty evil.  How about  Gilroy?  Simon?  Vaughn?

* Michael having to check his jumpsuit again to remember what company he was supposed to be with. (And it was quite an entrance.)

* ""I didn’t bring guidance chips for a Cuisinart.""

* ""No door-kicking!"" and Fi's obvious disappointment.

* ""One mistake and it’s lights out."" – ""You know, I’m actually already on top of that.""

* Sam and Jesse talking in unison. Hilarious.

* ""Giving the CIA half of what they want is a Sam Axe specialty.""

In the past 2 seasons, we forget that no one ever took care of Management, and as far as I know, he is still alive. Anson had Management watch out for him, just in case a situation like this would happen; and if this is true, then the Organization is still out there. 3: Its a longshot but Vaughn/Simon escaped and orcastrated the whole mess, or Agent Pierce was in Anson's pocket the whole time.

He makes a great villain, as far as anticipating Michael's every move... My problem is with Michael's reaction. Sure, Anson might have connections, but at the least, I'm sure Michael trusts Pearce. He should just tell her the truth. How long can he lead a ""triple life"", as [one review](http://www.daemonstv.com/2011/11/03/burn-notice-damned-if-you-do-advance-review/) put it? ([Another review](http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/11/burn-notice-review-damned-if-you-do/) predicted that he did in fact let Pearce in, and we just don't know about it yet.) And what makes Mike think Anson's just letting him go after this one job (major though it might be)?

Oswalt's screaming was hilarious, especially in the first scene where Michael tells him not to make a sound.

Madeline's apparently a quick learner - and I knew she'd pass the reaching-into-her-bag off as trying to sneak a cigarette.

* When Fi and Jesse run around to flank him, Grey moves position to shoot them. As a top notch sniper, why does he not even consider how the other people are positioning.

For example a bad episode (determined by fan reaction) will rate well because the episode that immediately proceeded it was good.

To that end I will be putting up a poll every week for fellow Burn Notice fans to rate the weeks episode out of 10. I realise there's only 1 episodes before the mid-season finale but its a start.

[Link to this weeks poll on my website.](http://ratingswatch.blogspot.com.au/2012/08/burn-notice-official-business-fan.html) 

Also included is a comparison of ratings for Burn Notice Season 5 vs the current (season 6)
I have also already done a comparison of all the USA original programming airing this summer, [which can be viewed here](http://ratingswatch.blogspot.com.au/2012/08/usa-network-summer-lineup-ratings.html)  it shows Burn Notice with a slender lead as the number 1 rated USA Network original show.

I eventually want to have color coded ratings graph's based on an average of fan reactions, including the rough trend. 

If you would like to help out a fellow Burn Notice fan and make your thoughts heard come on over and vote, maybe leave a comment as to why you thought an episode was good or bad.

Thanks

Just fyi I did post something similar on the ""Suits"" reddit, I am going to be following both shows for my research.

On a different note... I also figured there are subreddits for White Collar, Royal Pains (this one was started yesterday), and Covert Affairs. It turns out there are (their names are obvious: [/r/whitecollar](/r/whitecollar), [/r/royalpains](/r/royalpains), and [/r/covertaffairs](/r/covertaffairs)). None of these are really active either, and with all of those shows coming back soon (or already having started again), I figure it's a good time to get them active as well.

Similarly, I figure there should be a blanket subreddit for discussing all these shows, and USA shows with less active fanbases (or just discussion of the USA Network in general), and so I've considered creating an /r/USANetwork. Thoughts?

Season 1: Mike is broke, and builds everything he needs.  He succeeds by outfoxing his opponents, then uses a weapon to seal the deal.  (Hell there is even an episode (not sure of which season)where Fi makes explosives)

Season 5/6: Mike is CIA he gets everything he wants, and does whatever he wants to using a gun.

James Frain! I recognized him from the short-lived NBC show ""The Cape"" (which I personally enjoyed). He did a great job playing the ""bad guy pretending he's a good guy"" this episode (and he's great at looking terrified and yelling at people :P).

Sam seemed hungry this episode. Donuts, cheese fries... Damn it, now I'm hungry. I also loved him calling ""not it!"" on the errands, despite knowing their importance. ""Weren't expecting that, were ya?"" Heh, most adults don't. (Even funnier when he tried it again.)

Another ""client switcheroo"" this time around... I loved seeing Jesse's expression when he figured out that they were going to help Dan by getting James to trust them with security.

It was exciting seeing him try to figure out how to escape after he'd been seen on the cameras... Quite a risky move, that (since he's not serious).

The ending with Sadie being in the shadows as James said she was ""no catch"" reminded me of the end of Ocean's Eleven.

Lucien's interrogation was pretty uneventful, though I wasn't expecting him to signal for a rescue from captivity... Too bad his ""rescuer"" didn't feel so strongly about him. The threat about getting his daughter deported was, to the viewers, obviously fake (as we know Michael's not that kind of person). Now another lead to pursue... I wish we actually got some answers, or at least a hint or two, instead of another wild goose chase.

For those of you who don't remember it's the episode where they bring back Beatriz from fall of Sam Axe and Micheal learns in the last couple minutes of the episode that Anson arranged for the death of Frank Westen. I have been searching like all hell to find the song that was playing in the background of Anson's speech about how he arranged for Micheal's father's death. I have found a bunch of similar songs but I haven't found that specific song 

What I have found:
X men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QAhfhD2OA
Kopius Few - the ever under : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvx8Ql-d4lw
Source code trailer song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-HtvlE_Al9I

All these songs seem to be either derived from or father to the song from that specific scene.

Tom Card. We also know now that the CIA, the company Michael Westen once loved was also involved. So where does that leave us; the fans? Well, for one; it finally gives us some answers (but no more than Michael Westen, considering we find out the same information as him), like the CIA pulling the strings of every event that has happened during the series. What we, the fans don't know, is who is Tom Card's boss; the sole person that ordered the Burn Notice on Michael Westen, the person who framed Fiona for bombing the British Consulate, and the person who told the lie to make Sam a russian spy. I have one. It was Michael Westen's father, Frank Westen all along. See, we borderline know absolutely NOTHING about Frank Westen, with the exception of the things Michael has said (he was a asshole, he liked to beat the shit out of his two sons and their mother, he made Michael steal spark plugs by faking a seizure, he left Michael his charger; and the big tip off, Anson Fullerton was his psychologist who arranged his ""heart attack""). As for the last item on the list; what makes Anson a big tip off is the fact that the US Government and the CIA, they don't like to loan out a psychologist to other businesses, nor do they like for them to moonlight other places. Especially DIA. The only place the US Government and the CIA would let a DIA Psychologist like Anson Fullerton go, would be somewhere the CIA controlled, or a federal prison (like the one Vaughn and Simon are in).
As far as Frank Westen goes; I don't think he is ultimately dead. I think he was the one that ordered Michael Westen's burn notice, and was also the one who created the Organization initially, but after finding out that his Covert Operative son discovered who they were, he passed it on to Anson Fullerton, Management, and Tom Card with CIA backing. Do I think Michael is going to be able to ultimately kill Tom Card or meet his father? In a way yes, in a way no. You have to remember what Michael said about being a Covert Operative in previous episodes; that spies are just like thieves, except they steal for the flag; and also, **SPIES ARE PROFESSIONAL LIARS**. The CIA is full of them. Who's to say that Anson Fullerton was only posing as a DIA psychologist when he was a Operative himself??? I don't think Frank Westen had a heart attack nor do I think he is dead. I think he wanted to protect his family, using Michael Westen; CIA Covert Operative; as the metaphorical gun. You see, when Michael was burned, he was returned to his hometown. Don't you think if he was branded as a terrorist, the government and CIA would not want Michael anywhere near the USA, especially his hometown??? Michael being burned and dropped of in Miami meant that Frank Westen had someone that actually would know how to defend his family, the whole reason why Nate got assassinated along with Anson with a fucking .950 anti tank gun was because Frank Westen's smart son, Michael was uncovering more and more and more, and making Anson Fullerton a liability. I think Anson was terrified when he finally got confronted by Michael, and Tom Card and Frank Westen thought that if Michael captured and tortured Anson; that Anson would eventually spill the beans as to who is behind his organization; which would be Frank Westen. 
On another note, if Card has alot of CIA Agents on his side; I don't think Michael Westen will get very far without taking half the CIA out, which would either get Michael Westen killed (Series Finale, Michael finally gets to talk to his father after all the years of seperation, and in the end Frank Westen ends his son's life), or Michael Westen takes out the operatives in the CIA that are part of the organization with the President of The United States blessing, and finally ends everything once and for all. 
TL;DR Frank Westen burned his son, Michael Westen, and also ordered Nate to be assassinated because he did not want both his son's to be Covert Operatives."	t5_2rusp	True
