I have accrued over 3000 points on duolingo. I haven't done any translations really and I haven't reviewed any of the words that I have learned. I have just been going on to the next lesson and finishing it and then moving forward trying to reach the end of the map.

1360252209.0	182hqv	We’re making some changes to Duolingo and we’d like your feedback	vonahn	79	8	41	"We've recently been testing some changes with 50% of our new users. The tests are going very well, but I'd like to ask for your feedback before we switch all users to the new mechanics.

**A new way we keep track of your progress**

It’s easy to forget the material in all the skills you’ve “mastered” when you don’t practice. That’s why we’re rolling out a new way to help you track your learning better. 

Now, instead of a progress bar on each skill in the tree, you’ll see the average word strength of all the words in that skill (which goes down over time when you don't practice these words!). Also, instead of seeing hearts in the notebooks once you’ve finished a lesson you’ll see a ‘strength bar’ that shows your average word strength. At a glance, you’ll be able to see what your weakest skills and lessons are and be able to practice them. The more you practice your weakest words, the more complete the bar will become, and the better you’ll know the language.

One thing to mention is that if we make the switch, some of your beautifully golden ""mastered"" skills may turn out to have less than perfect word strengths. Even though this may affect your sense of past completion, it’s a far more accurate reflection of what you actually know in the language. We hope this will help you better understand your progress in the language.

**Real-world translations**

One of the main goals of learning a language is being able to apply it to real world materials. We want the real world content to fit naturally into the learning process, so we are testing different ways for learners to access it.

Rather than seeing real-world documents inside each skill, where they did not always match the skill you were learning, we are trying a different approach. Alongside the normal Practice button, there will now be a “Real world practice” that will give you real world sentences that exercise the words you have learned much better.

We’ll continue testing these updates with new users over the next week or so. In the meantime, let us know what you think.

I took the Spanish CLEP test last Wednesday and got a score of 59 ([Proof](http://imgur.com/3ZNmAii)). This was enough to get 10 hours worth of credit at my university (Mizzou). Typically, 6 hours is awarded for a score of 50 and 12 hours for a score of 63.

What's so great is that I almost exclusively used Duolingo to learn Spanish and to study for the CLEP. I've maybe made 3 posts on Lang-8 and finished Hacking Spanish on Memrise - besides that, all Duolingo. I finished the Duolingo Spanish course a couple months ago and have been practicing every day for 15-30 minutes ever since. It took me roughly four months to finish the course at that same pace (about 30 minutes a day). 

So, that's what Duolingo can get you. I'm really glad I found this and decided to pursue it. That saved me a lot of money. I plan on becoming fluent in the future, as well.

I'm interested in learning them but since they're not easily findable, I don't have a great way to practice them.  After all, the lessons are very much focused on vocabulary and verb forms.

So my suggestion is this: If you finish your tree, you unlock some special bonus lessons that let you practice the more idiomatic questions found throughout the course.

I suppose an extension of this idea would be bonus lessons that focus on things like ""various uses of *de* or *à*"" or ""*en* vs *dans*"" or whatever other common problems people seem to have in their language of choice."	t5_2t6ze	True

^(**DISCLAIMER: this bit basically explains how the education system works**)

In British secondary schools (ages 12-16 and grade/year-group 7 to 11) we get an accreditation called GCSEs. Usually after we get our GCSEs we use them to apply prove that we're knowledgable enough in our subjects to take up A-levels in sixth form. Sixth form lasts for two years, usually, from ages 16 to 18 (grade/year-group 12-13).

So if I took *GCSE* German Language and got an A or B I would be able to apply to a sixth form to do *A-level* German Language. You then use your A-levels to get into university (aka college in American English)

So 

* ----&gt; Secondary School gets you GCSEs, to go to
* ----&gt; Sixth form gets you A-levels, to go to
* ----&gt; University gets you a diploma ---&gt; Profit?

^(**DISCLAIMER END**)

Ok, so I've been using Duolingo for sixth months now. I'd been practicing German a little bit for a few months previously with things like Michel Thomas, Memerise, a few evening classes ^((they're overrated)^) and Livemocha, but nothing really substantial. I had a basic head for some of the simple grammar from Michel Thomas, but that was pretty much it. However, I recently walked over to my school's language department and asked if I could start an A-level in the next year. So she said if I could prove that my German language was that of a GCSE student, she'd happily let me on the course. I was then handed some past papers and asked to fill them out and hand them back in after a week. I did and got roughly a B and will start the A-level in September.

So because of Duolingo (and some other sources) I've been able to sidestep years of Secondary School education in foreign languages and jump straight in at the interesting part.

**IMPORTANT: I'm only about half way through the Duolingo course with coins:2,400 and words: 650. I recently unlocked the skill ""Verbs: Present 2"". I've by no means finished the course.**

This is partly a testament to how easy Secondary School Education is, and partly a testament to how easy it is to learn a if you have the personal will and the right tools. I did use a variety of things to help me learn, but Duo is definitely the most prominent resource I used. I can't articulate a lot in German, but I understand a good amount of the grammar and can actually say somethings, which is more than can be said for a lot of people who use the normal school route. My German's still full of mistakes and there's tons I do not know, but yeah, it's definitely something. Feel free to ask me anything. "	t5_2t6ze	True

Hopefully this will make it a bit easier for everyone to catch all of the new information we have been given

I left a few of the questions out intentionally (specifically joke responses and financial questions [due to my own unease at reproducing]). If anyone notices any answers I have left out (especially if he resumes on Wednesday), please let me know and I'll update this ASAP.

**Duolingo Bugs**

* Users may experience more incorrect translations the further they go into a skill tree. This is likely due to lessons not being as thoroughly tested as the lessons early in the tree.

My German ex-girlfriend came to visit me from Berlin yesterday. Before she came, I had been secretly doing German Duolingo and lang-8, while studying grammar on my own. I can report to you that we are able to hold a casual German conversation about present, past and future. I mess up a lot the genders of words, but if i am certain, I am able to say a correct sentence. I soooo excited guys!!

If I can suggest you, use lang-8 and write about anything - what you did, what you plan to do and let people correct it. But don't just write and submit it - think about the grammar a lot. Question all your words. It really helps great deal.

I can't wait to go out tonight and speak some more German. :-)

You need to come up with sentences reasonably fast, and not being able to do so means that you haven't truly mastered the vocabulary yet.

That being said, I think the current implementation has a serious shortcoming: the timer keeps ticking between questions (after submitting one answer and before hitting [Enter] to see the next question). This encourages people to just hit Enter without looking at the mistakes they made, or also without reporting any problems with the supplied ""correct"" answers.

1363711430.0	1alnf8	Wiki-Style Translations	vonahn	53	7	10	"Today we're starting to test a new way to do real-world translations. Most of you won't be able to see them yet, but I wanted to describe how they work in order to get some feedback. While the previous version did a few things well, we felt it was over-constrained and was not as enjoyable as our lessons. So, we're testing the new format in an effort to make the experience more enjoyable and also increase the learning outcome.

The main idea is to give more emphasis to reading real documents in the language you're learning. Instead of dropping you in the middle of a document and asking you to translate a randomly selected sentence as we did before, we place you at the top of the document and let you freely interact with it. Here's what it looks like when you start: [http://imgur.com/wYMaot5](http://imgur.com/wYMaot5)

Some of the sentences in the document may already have a translation from a community member. If you put your mouse over one of these, the current translation is shown above it, and the word that you're hovering over will be highlighted in both the original sentence and the translation (of course, this won't always be possible because there is not an exact correspondence between the words in the original language and the translation). We want to give you the tools to understand the article in your new language. Here's what this looks like: [http://imgur.com/ZKxtfBz](http://imgur.com/ZKxtfBz)

For each sentence, you can either edit its translation (much like you would edit a wiki), or you can say that the translation looks good to you by clicking on the check button. Once you've done this, the sentence turns green to indicate that you've read it and understood it. You get points for going over each sentence :)

If an article is not yet finished, the sentences may stop having a translation after a certain point. For those, you can be the first to add a translation (and get points by doing so!).

There are many other bells and whistles, such as comments on each sentence, a revision history of all the translations, the ability to follow a given sentence in case you want to be notified of any changes somebody makes, etc.

I started doing Spanish on April 1 as a complete beginner and I finished the lessons on May 24. I now estimate that I am at level  A1 on the CEFRL scale (CEFRL has 6 levels with A1 being the lowest and C2 being the highest). I probably know about 500 Spanish words pretty well and can somewhat comfortably have an EXTREMELY BASIC Spanish conversation (""Hello!"" ""Where is the bathroom?"" ""I am American."" etc etc) and understand most Spanish signs and simple text that has a  limited vocabulary (childrens books, simple articles etc)

NOTES:
(1) Duolingo is absolutely addictive compared to traditional methods like books. I would often neglect my real work to work on getting more points on Duolingo. Three of the factors that contribute to this are (i) The short lessons each of which can be done in 5-10 minutes (ii) The immediate feedback on mistakes (iii) The social aspect of competing for points.

(2) Don't expect too much, you probably won't reach a high level in a language by using only Duolingo. You should plan to combine with other resources and practice to really get to a good level with your language.

(3) Don't RUSH. I made the mistake of rushing to finish as fast as possible and I think because of that I didn't master some points as well as I would have if I had taken it slower.

(4) Related to (3),STRONGLY resist the urge to peak at a dictionary or on Google Translate (especially if you're trying to test out). You might get the points but you won't learn as much or as quickly. (Yes, this is obvious but it bears saying!)

(5) It is harder to get motivated to do the translations after you have completed the ""game tree"" especially if you are still not fluent so you struggle with the translations. I am still working on this.

In conclusion I think Duolingo is a FANTASTIC resource for starting to learn a language, as it helps you to get over the hump of ""Where do I start?"" and it helps keep you motivated to keep going, but I would just caution new users to have realistic expectations of how much and how fast they will improve if they ONLY use Duolingo to learn their language.

1339947105.0	v6i0g	I'm your new moderator. Hi. Let's talk a bit about this subreddit.	mygrapefruit	45	4	51	"I PM'd Atroxide asking if s/he needed an additional mod to help out, I never got a PM back but it seems like s/he gave the whole subreddit up to me instead? Sweet. Bow down to me your new overlord etc etc.

As you can see I've already snuck in a few facts and links in the sidebar. What else do you want there? What should I change? Here's a few things I thought about:

* Done! Thankyou conan93 for the CSS style and Godd2 for the logo. ~~This subreddit's style. I was thinking something similar to what [r/minecraftfaq](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftfaq) has but of course, duolingo.com's look. Or is what we have currently enough? I remember seeing someone editing Duo to look like the reddit alien. Link please so I can add him?~~

* Fixed! ~~Should we do anything about the invitation threads? Y/N? I know it's just a few days left until they're moot but 70% of the frontpage is currently cluttered with those threads. I have 40 invites so I could easily take over ALL invitations if you want (you get additional 3 for every person who accepts invitation). I can put a notification on top of the subreddit saying something like ""PM Mygrapefruit for an invitation"". I've also seen many people commenting their personal e-mail which is a big no-no. They'll get crawled and spammed in no time. :(~~

* Fixed! Check the sidebar~~Make a public Google Doc that shows all user names, link it in sidebar, so we can add eachother? Y/N?~~

1370573259.0	1fu5y7	Interesting suggestions on improving pronunciation instruction in duolingo from a linguistics professor	oskalingo	50	6	5	"http://www.duolingo.com/#/comment/462063

&gt; Hello Duolingo,

&gt; My name is Joshua Smolders, and I am a linguistics professor at a Canadian University. I was introduced to your website by a friend and was immediately excited. I want to congratulate you on a revolutionary concept: the merging of social media with language learning and website translation in order to make language education free and accessible and to make the vast work of translation feasible while preserving its quality. It is an idea that I am sure will have great success. The interface of this website is very user-friendly, and the language learning experience is great. I am currently using the site to help with my French (as my profile suggests).

&gt; There is one aspect of your language learning model, however, that I believe should and could be easily improved: pronunciation and mastering the sound system. As I have been working through the French modules, I have found myself again and again unsure of which vowel or consonant was being pronounced and having to look it up in an online dictionary. While the computerized voice is fairly high quality, it alone cannot replace the training garnered by listening to and getting the feedback of a native speaker.

&gt; I believe the ambiguity in pronunciation of certain words and the absence of native-speaker training could be alleviated by adding two things to your current system: 1) an initial lesson on the sound system. 2) an option to view the pronunciation of any word or phrase (transcribed using the international phonetic alphabet).

&gt; Concerning the first, adding an additional lesson (or maybe a whole new tab/section of the learner's profile) on the sound system and intonation of the language would be very beneficial to your users. An example of this might include an interactive diagram showing correspondences between the sounds of user's mother tongue and the sounds of their target language. Using face diagrams, the site could show how one physically pronounces the vowels and consonants of their own language and then compare this to the target language, especially focusing on sounds that do not occur in the learner's own language. You could also have ""hearing practice"", where a vowel or consonant is given in a monosyllabic word and the user must identify the correct vowel phoneme. I believe such an addition would be of great benefit for improving the quality of spoken second language acquisition (as opposed to just written language acquisition) for your product.

&gt; Concerning the second, the website could also teach relevant symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for the target language's consonant and vowels, and then an option to ""show pronunciation"" could be added to the regular phrases. Not only would this be useful to the user for understanding the difference between written and spoken language, but it would also be doing a great service to the online world in terms of the standardization of pronunciation keys. Most online dictionaries and encyclopedic websites have already begun integrating IPA, and language learning websites and programs should consider following suit.

&gt; I hope you have found these ideas helpful. Thank you for considering them and I wish you the best of luck with your enterprise.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Joshua Smolders"	t5_2t6ze	True
1366243641.0	1ckki6	ONE YEAR of Duolingo	rweba	47	6	16	"So I see a LOT of questions here of the form ""But how much will I REALLY learn with Duolingo?""

I started Duolingo Spanish on April 1, 2012 and have been doing it basically every day since then so I can give one data point. 

VERY IMPORTANT : I was a COMPLETE BEGINNER, with no previous classes or exposure to Spanish. I probably knew less than 10 Spanish words when I started Duolingo.

Also in addition to Duolingo I used Memrise and Pimsleur pretty extensively, but more recently I have been listening more to web series and  podcasts like 

""Extra en Español"" : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-dx6kd5f4E (link to first episode) 

and ""Notes in Spanish"" http://www.notesinspanish.com

I have also recently started using http://lang-8.com/ to practice my writing and I love it. (here's my account there : http://lang-8.com/556562)

Question : So am I FLUENT in Spanish yet?

Answer : NO, I definitely would not consider myself FLUENT. My biggest weakness is speaking, I don't have the practise or confidence to have a flowing Spanish conversation. If I had to classify myself I would consider myself an advanced beginner or lower intermediate.  (A2 or B1 on the CEFR scale):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels

HOWEVER: I know a HECK of a lot more Spanish than when I started! My vocabulary is pretty good and I can get the gist of almost any Spanish text. I can understand audio if they speak slowly (unfortunately most don't!)

As far as writing :

Quizas es mejor a dar un ejemplo de mi nivel de escribiendo. No es tan mal, puedo expresar mis pensamientos bastante bien, pero hay muchos errores de gramatica. Sé muchas palabras, asi que el vocabulario no es problema. Los accentos son un problema : siempre los me olvidos! También los tenses son difícil - ¡especialmente el subjunctivo! Me escribio este y no consulta un diccionario o otro recurso para realmente mostrar la situación actualmente :-)

[Free Translation : 
Perhaps it's better to give an example of my writing level. It's not that bad, I can express my thoughts pretty well, but there are a lot of grammatical errors. I know a lot of words, so vocabulary is not a problem. The accents are a problem: I always forget them! Also the tenses are difficult - especially the subjunctive! I am writing this and not consulting a dictionary or other resource in order to really show the current situation :-) ]

So the executive summary is that you'll learn a lot, but you probably won't become totally fluent within a few months!"	t5_2t6ze	True

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve Duolingo we're running a study to measure how well people learn with the site (and how well they learn certain topics). To do this we're running a study in which we compare the test results of users before and after using Duolingo.

We need beginner users of Spanish that:

- Have not advanced beyond Basics 2

- Are willing to commit to using Duolingo for 30 hours.

- Are willing to give us basic demographical data.

What you get:

- A chance to take the WEBCape placement test in Spanish -- twice!

- A $20 Amazon gift card.

If you're interested, please send us an email to assessment@duolingo.com with your Duolingo username (we may not be able to choose everybody who applies).

* Fast
* Beautiful UI
* Great sounds
* Smooth performance
* Makes really easy to get through lessons successfully. Possibly moves faster than online (especially loading times, I think.
* Has a warning message if you navigate away mid-lesson
* Tried it on data, didn't seem to use very much, guessing communication is minimized on purpose
* No annoying bugs, it's well-designed from the get-go, with a great focus on usability.
* Did I mention this app was beautiful? And no ads etc. to annoy you!


Still some things missing, guessing they're coming:

* Cannot send feedback in-lesson like you can online. i.e. if you think you're right.
*  ~~No real-world translations. Obviously this is in the works, because that is the whole point of duolingo.~~ Just realized that real world translations are currently only accessible through lessons. Interesting choice. However, it only shows you the original text of the sentence you're translating. You can't check out the existing translations/offer suggestions etc., and it's useful to see the other translations to see how a certain phrase or word that is repeated in the article is translated by other users.
* Don't seem to be able to connect/view other people/followers. (Also probably in progress)
* It seems to log you off when you lose internet connection, and then you have to log back on, inputting your username/password. Don't see why it can't just remember your password or just exit the app without logging you out. Also, behavior when you get logged out is a little strange. For example, if you don't have internet and you try to log in, it says ""Username incorrect"" instead of notifying you that your internet connection isn't on. Lots of apps manage this quite well, not sure why duolingo can't do the same.
* Doesn't seem to remember the settings for no daily reminder. Every time I return to that screen it still says ON, for all the languages (should be one settings page for all the languages by the way, with menus on the settings page for controlling individual languages. Managing 4 different settings pages that looks the same is too complicated). 
* Would be nice to be able to see weekly progress like you can online
* Would be nice to view the vocab page and access the timed practices, but guessing this is also in the works.
* Would be nice if it didn't take the full screen during lessons - i.e. it hides the clock, battery, and internet connection bar that is usually at the top. Not such a big deal, but it seems like there's enough space for it, just that they decided to include a black margin and graphics that make it look like real pages stacked on top of each other (which is very nice, but maybe can achieve both?)

Ever since using Duolingo not only am I learning how to read a new languge VERY well but also write one. The key thing for me is the leveling up aspect.

I am a big gamer, and experience point systems are my crack cocaine. The feeling of getting my points when I finish a lesson and seeing my level bar go up is sooooo addicting.

I also am a trophy/achievement whore, so actually finishing and also MASTERING a lesson block is uber satisfying for me as well. Doing all of that helps me retain more of the language.

My Thoughts:

The Duolingo Spanish course is **fantastic** for about three-quarters of the skill tree.  When I say that it is the most complete course that I have found so far, I am being 100% truthful.  It lays down a very nice foundation for both beginning and intermediate learners to build off and incorporates a good amount of grammar and vocab in order to be able to use the language in everyday situations.  However, once the learner gets close to the end, many of the verb sections tend to become a little ambiguous, and I was routinely left unsure of how to translate sentences with little to no explanation.  

The most glaring example of this was the Subjunctive Past, which only contained one lesson and no tips section, causing it to take about two hours for me to finish it.  Without sites like [studyspanish.com](http://www.studyspanish.com/), I most likely would not have made it through the section.  Fleshing out this and other sections would be extremely beneficial to ensure that the learner has a consistently rewarding experience.  Furthermore, I believe that the social aspect of Duolingo needs to be expanded.  Group chats, forums, utilization of Google Hangouts, and forming competitive teams would all help the learners to improve upon their speaking skills, while also adding an even more addictive and game-like element to the site.

All of this being said, I felt that Duolingo was an unbelievably great experience and can't wait to continue using it for my studies in Italian.  I hope that my criticism doesn't come off as too harsh and can be used to further improve an already great learning resource.

That way you can still do a general review that gets multliple words at once, and focus a bit on the hardest words. 

Edit:

Another suggestion is that it might be convenient to be able to 'uncheck' words that are well-known while doing the timed review questions.

1356739332.0	15lklq	After 8 months, here are my thoughts on DuoLingo (I love it!):		39	12	8	"Dear DuoLingo Team,

Thank you all very much for your efforts. I am amazed that you have been able to do what you have, it is truly an astounding accomplishment, worthy of great praise. Your efforts to 'translate the world' are coming to life. Thank you very much for the great help to humanity, to my country, and to me in trying to understand other people. 

I have just completed and mastered all the lessons in the Spanish Language tree after 8 months on the site. I saw the opening and have been with Spanish from the Beta. I managed to get 8 of my friends to join DuoLingo and 3 of them are sticking with it. Finishing and 'mastering' DuoLingo Spanish was a goal on 6 month's list and I am very proud to say I accomplished it. Along with that I was able to translate just north of 300 sentences for the world. After a short break for the holidays I am setting my sights on Italian in preparation for the Goldschmidt Geology Conference in Florence in August. I am hungry for more. 

So, after 'mastering' Spanish now, I feel I should write to you and give some feedback after our 8 month relationship. In the Boy Scouts we always had 'Roses, Thorns and Buds' after a hike or meeting to discuss the good things, the bad things and the things we hoped to do next time. I will employ this technique for feedback. I want to warn, that I have only experience in the Spanish Tree, that I did not use the voice recognition part of the site due to lack of hardware, so my experience is colored by that. My Previous experience in Spanish was for 3 years in high school, listening to Spanish language radio for 3 months before a 2 week vacation to Argentina a year ago, and since I currently live in Los Angeles, I tend to use it to talk to people. 


Roses:

* Going home for the holidays means siting in planes and smiling at the Rosetta Stone adds on the back of SkyMall. They price their 5 programs per language at $400 and I paid nothing for mine. DuoLingo being free and committing to being free is ludicrous. You are all crazy. I love it. I am amazed by it. I rave about you all every chance I get and I try to recommend you as much as I can to anyone trying to learn a language. The no-cost approach is just amazing,
* Going home also means lots of waiting. But I can still practice my DuoLingo on the phone at the airport. What an amazing thing! I can actually do real work, real practice, anywhere. The future is astounding and you make me feel like I am living in it. I have used the app on the bus, while waiting for friends, at the bar, in bed, and when my computer is on my desk too. I love the mobile version.
* The typing algorithms are good at seeing my typos, I appreciate that. I use a standard QWERTY keyboard on a ThinkPad and I often misspell words. I am usually not punished for that in terms of points
* The audio in the Spanish version is great. The woman was clear, had correct 'standard' Spanish pronunciation most of the time and it is well implements visually for me to type out what she is saying. 
*The sentences in general were of use, I could use them in speech everyday. I really got a feel for some sentences and will think in then now.
* The feedback button is amazing. I try to leave feedback, and the new ability to follow a sentence is great. Everyone should have this. I feel that it is an obvious but very important part of the learning process that I have not seen anywhere else. Where did you get the idea from? To me, it seems like a way to 'comment' your code, an understated but invaluable tool.  
* Let me say this again: THE FEEDBACK BUTTON IS AMAZING. It really makes me think why other places do not have a similar system. It seems so obvious to me now, and that is why I think it is amazing. If this is an' in-house' invention you have done something revolutionary for feedback. I wish I could use this all over the web.
* I was originally wary of the timed practice, but I now love it. I can barely make 3 points, but when I do go on a roll of 15 points, I feel great. 
* DuoLingo is easy to use and very friendly. I like the look of it. Whoever is doing your webdesign, they should ask for more money. It is cute and my girlfriend loves Duo. You are doing a great job with it there. Are there any plans of making a plushy Duo to buy? Where can I get shirts? I want to advertise you. 
* The POINTS! ERMAHGERD! I need more points! This was a great system that you implemented. I am easily able to gauge my daily progress based on the points. I usually limited myself to south of 100 points a day, or about 30 minutes of Duo. But it never was easy for me to pull away. I always found an excuse to do another translation or lesson. I love those little points!
* Finally, I feel that my learning is not selfish. In trying to help 'translate the world' I feel I really am helping. It is great to see the sentences translated bar go up, little by little, and to contribute, in a small way, to the world. I am able to live my scout oath through DuoLingo, I can say that helped other people, that I left the world better than I found it each day. 

Thorns:

* The audio speed, at some points, was tough to hear right. I would often miss a 'la' or 'al' or 'en' I try to leave feedback when this happens.
* When I was near the heart loss limit for a lesson, I would make the audio repeat word for word. This slowed my progress a bit and I felt it was a little cheaty. Yet I still did it anytime I had a heart or less. 
* The lack of vos/vosotros and other regional variations was notable. I know you are providing Spain Spanish, not Argentine Spanish. But a little lesson on it would not have hurt, or an option to have that regional variation as my preference. 
* The typo recognition still needs work, good as it is. I cannot for the life of me, type nosotros correctly. 
* The vocab needs to be played more. I really know what a manzana is now, but I need to have the vocab more used on a daily 'workout'. Put it in my other lessons that day. You do a really good job as is, but recognize when I am doing lessons and plug it in then. 
* I found myself bailing on a lesson and restarting when I got a heart off in the first 3 questions. If I didn't it would be 'wasted' time and I found I rarely could finish and pass a lesson if I got one wrong in the first 3. It was really frustrating and I had to rage-quit DuoLingo a dozen times because of this. Still, I came back.
* I almost never used the correct letters. An á was never typed as such and I always got the warning but never missed points. I assume you are grappling with this issue, but I myself needed a better deterrent than just the warning. Perhaps an 'opt in' option to take points off would be good.
* Ok, this one really ticked me off, mostly at myself, but you need a gigantic 'congratulations' page when I get to a key-hole or learn or master all the lessons above one. And especially at the end when I mastered the whole tree. I mean, come on guys, I got 10,000 points and no special email at least!? I had to manually screen grab a page and post it to FaceBook. I wanted a huge splash page like when I master a lesson, with the little trumpet and everything! I wanted crummy .gif effects like in Solitare.
* I used the keyholes as personal markers for my progress. I would go out to a restaurant when I reached one and order drinks in terrible Spanish. I used them as benchmarks for my progress in the skills tree and I thought they were. I was disappointed when I didn't have a special thing when I reached them and that I had to invent one myself. I wanted more interaction there. 
* The pacing in general is a bit aggressive now. I do not feel that I have 'mastered' a lesson, and especially one like 'subjunctive past' with only one lesson. I understand that you need me to do more translations and contribute in that way to the efforts we are in, but I feel the 'mastered' status is not true and cheapens it. I want to determine when I have mastered it.
* The social aspect of is lacking too. All I can do is to see how many points my friends have. I will be fair and say I almost never used the FaceBook Linking part, and that stems from my dislike of Facebook's privacy policies, which I know you must also have to deal with in the tug of social vs private. Still, I wanted more interaction with my friends on DuoLingo. I wanted to taunt them with the point chest I acquired that day, and feel bad at all the points they got that morning. I wanted to see if I had a better translation than them. I wanted to compete a bit with them.
* The translations, the point of DuoLingo, are difficult for me. Mostly because I didn't take them that seriously. Yes, I know, I talked of morality earlier, but I have to be honest here. I BS'd my way through rating some of the translations. I would read about 3 words in and then decide if the translation was right or not. Not much more. I took solace in thinking that others would catch the mistakes and I could hide in the noise.
* The translations in general, are doing a lot better, the like/dislike system at the bottom of the page is good and easy, I used it a lot. Still, they were not a highlight of the learning experience for me, I liked the 'drill and kill' of the lessons better. 
* Also, the actual translating in a sentence by sentence basis is difficult in Spanish. I have to check when the pronoun is male or female a lot. It's not hard to do, but having it in the dictionary might be a lot easier and faster overall. For example: I am translating an article on a male F1 driver and 'su' comes up. I don't know if that should translate to 'his' or 'her' without looking above to see of the driver is male or female. 
* With a lack of lessons and goals for myself that DuoLingo presents, I am unsure what my future plans are for DuoLingo Spanish. I do not want to drop it all together, But I feel that I am going to have to invent new goals for myself, 20,00 points, 2000 sentences, etc. You should give me a clearer goal now that i have finished the tree. I still want to help.

1355463391.0	14tvsl	My one month review of Duolingo	Chodarth	33	3	30	"I started using Duolingo the day the iPhone app came out. I've been studying Portuguese Beta (almost) everyday since then for about an hour a day.



While I like the fact that it makes me want to come back and keep doing it everyday I've found that it's probably not the best way to learn a language (for me).



I haven't tried any of the other languages so I can only comment on the Portuguese Beta version. I think the computer voice is terrible but from what I've read they paid a lot of money for it and it's not going to be replaced. I wish they could do some sort of crowd sourced audio like Rhinospike.com where native users upload the sentence/word audio for the lessons. You could offer people points for uploading audio (from their iphone!?) and let other users rate the quality. Another reason this would be great is that there could be several different versions of each sentence/word with different accents and male/female voices! 



I've managed to reach level 11 in the Portuguese Beta in this past month. I don't know if I will continue to use it as I feel that I would have learned a lot more by learning on my own but the fact of the matter is, the hardest part about learning a language (for me), is motivation. I actually want to keep coming back everyday and increasing my score (btw I've friended a bunch of people who work at duolingo on the site and haven't seen any of them actually finish one of the languages).



Below is a link to screenshots I've taken from my phone with about 90 different mistakes I've found while doing Portuguese Beta this past month. There were more than this but I did some lessons on the PC and didn't take any screenshots. Some of these might not be wrong but they sure fooled me.



[Duolingo Portuguese Beta Errors](http://imgur.com/a/vtPuA#0)



I think what I finally realized is that Duolingo's ultimate goal is to translate the internet. I do not want to be a translator. I want to be able to speak and understand Portuguese. Duolingo is designed to get it's users to translate from their target language into their native language. Yes, you do end up learning a lot about the language you are studying but you will not become fluent by using Duolingo. 





Maybe I should wait for Portuguese to be out of Beta? If you've completed or gotten far in any of the other languages that aren't in Beta how did you like it?



This is in no way intended to bash Duolingo, just my personal thoughts. I think it could be a great addition to someone's language learning catalogue.

1376449348.0	1kbp26	[German] Any tricks for remembering/recognizing Fem/Masc/Neu Nouns?	Kastro187420	32	6	17	"This seems to be the one single thing that trips me up more than anything else on these things. I have yet to finish a single ""Lesson Practice"" today so far because I simply cannot remember what the nouns are. There are certain ones, like Man/Woman, Boy/Girl, Child, Bear and such that I can remember simple enough, but the rest, it's just a complete guessing game still.

This whole ""Fem/Masc/Neu"" thing just seems like a completely unnecessary complication in the language. I'm not really sure what value it adds to it yet. The only thing it's accomplished this far is creating frustration with trying to learn.. and when you're talking about learning potentially hundreds and thousands of words, it just becomes one giant cluster-f**k of a mess without some kind of system.

Is there something I'm missing here for recognizing these things? I know, at least as far as German words go, you can recognize a Fem Noun if it ends in -ung (at least, I understand most do), but translating from English into German and remembering what's Fem and what's Masc... I'm just at a loss here, and it's really killing my progress, especially since each lesson adds some new thing I have to learn and remember ontop of all the nouns and verb forms, in addition to the Accusative and Nominative forms you have to learn (which I'm slowly understanding).

I really don't want to give up on this since I've made a lot of progress already, but if I can't figure something out, I may just have to wait for a different language to show up that doesn't include all these annoyances =/"	t5_2t6ze	True

Typically it is not even possible to guess from the list of translations that pop up when you mouse over the sentence. The effect of this is that I'm having to repeat lessons a lot more frequently because the first time around I fail from incorrectly guessing what is meant which is quite frustrating. 

For example, I'm presented with the sentence: ""Il a un travail alimentaire"".  Since ""alimentaire"" is new, I'm told it means ""food"" or ""dietary"". So I guess ""He has a food job"" - which is incorrect. Instead it says the correct answer is either ""He has a potboiler job"" (wtf?) or ""He has a job to make ends meet"".  I would click on the ""Still think you are correct?"" link, but really my translation is wrong (even though it is correct in a literal sense).

Inspired and reminded by Melancholic_stranger about having a source for language learning resources. Let me know if this is a better way than having a reddit thread. :o

So, it started with the redditor spreadsheet. Next I put it inside a private Duolingo folder on Google docs, adding a few private documents for the moderators to read. I saw the [compilation thread on r/languagelearning](http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/gt1t7/a_compilation_of_language_learning_resources/), but that thread seemed a bit dead so I made a doc containing all those links instead. 

I was planning on making the folder public when it contained enough info, but I'm just 1 person so I never got it done. So now I made this thread. It would be nice if the community helped out! The folder is now public: 

[CLICK HERE :D](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B9ZGasID5ol7Q3YycHZSbDYtWjQ/edit)

As you can see it's under heavy construction, and just might be in need of a redesign concerning layout and what info should go in which doc. It's very Duolingo-centered as of right now, but I hope it could be centered around language learning in general (maybe Duolingo shouold get its own folder INSIDE the Language folder, *inception*), so the folks over at /r/languagelearning can replace that compilation thread with an active one. The rest of the internet might find it useful too!

As for you, the user, you're free to contribute ideas by posting in this thread! Few questions I have:

- ~~as mentioned above, should /r/duolingo get its own folder inside a bigger ""Lingua"" folder?~~ done ;D        

- should /r/duolingo mods be the only ones in charge of the docs, or do you want to be able to edit too? who should get access?

- in what way should the current layout be changed?

- please, please type down any thoughts &amp; ideas that you might have!

For example, in a document about _Star Wars_, I did a translation that is likely not perfect - but I was attempting to convey the science fiction and ""it doesn't do anyone harm"" aspects in natural English.

A few minutes later, this email arrives:

Mikeybarnes	28	3	15	"I've whinged a lot about this in the past few months, and whilst everyone I've spoken to about it has been very helpful, both on /r/duolingo and the discussion section of the site itself, my complaint has never been directly addressed by Duolingo themselves. 

In the hope of actually getting an reply that actually addresses the issue, I sent them a message via Facebook which was blocked for containing a link to [french.about.com](http://french.about.com).

This is that message;
&gt;Hi there Duolingo, how's it going?
(Or prehaps I should say ""comment ça-va?"" now that I can!)

&gt;First off, thank you for providing humanity with such a great way of improving themselves - and all for free! I've been using Duolingo for a few months now and I'm really having fun with it. 

&gt;My only complaint would - and consistently *has* - been that there seems to be a complete absence of lessons in the French section.
Having poked around both the German and Spanish sections of the site, I notice that there are grammar notes included in the lessons, whereas with French the learner is given no guidance at all that I can find, which serves only to encourage learning the correct answers (by rote) in each lesson in order to pass.

&gt;I was expecting these grammar notes to appear after French came out of beta, but actually they never materialised. Now you're releasing new language after new language (for which you are to be commended one again) but with apparent disregard to bringing the French section up to standard with the others.

&gt;I would love for those grammar notes to make an appearance. However, all I am currently asking for is some clarification on if/when it will happen.

From what it looks like, you can now do all of the lessons without ever translating real content. From what I gather, you can opt to translate parts of articles under the ""immersion"" tab. But it also seems that all of those articles are just uploaded by users... so my questions are these: 

1. Where is the incentive to translate?? 

2. If those articles are user-uploaded, where is the actual translating for paying clients happening?

*Congratulations on finishing the Duolingo German tree! Since you've conquered the material we teach so far, you might be wondering how your new German skills measure up on a standard, university-level placement exam.*

*We are, too! That's why we're inviting you to take the official German webCAPE exam. Free!*

So I took it, [got a 560](http://imgur.com/kRbQliO).

Unfortunately, I already *passed* fourth semester German when I was in college, so it's kinda a downer to be told that's my level, heh. I know I've improved since then, with Duolingo mostly to thank for that. Here's to hoping the ""or higher"" part would apply. We certainly didn't learn a number of those sentence structures in the classes I took.

A few thoughts...

As far as I can remember, Duolingo never taught us the ""They say that my aunt has cancer"" sentence construction (""Meine Tante __ Krebs haben""). I had multiple questions phrased this way. I managed to get them right (asked a native speaker after I'd finished), but if this is something that really shows up on placement exams, then I'd say add it to the site lessons.

1371539200.0	1gklhf	Suggestion: Help maintain multiple languages by alternating the previously learnt material with english.	skullgrid	29	6	4	"This would only apply (perhaps optionally) to those who have used duolingo in more than one target language. What I mean is this: if I've completed several lessons in spanish, and then decide to start german, why not have me translate between german and spanish rather than german and english? That way, I can learn german while maintaining my spanish skills. Since the lesson material seems to be mostly the same across the languages, it should be able to be implemented fairly straightforwardly. If a user has more than two languages on duolingo, all of them could be alternated between. Even better, the user could choose which languages they wish to keep in the rotation.

Sorry if this has been suggested already. I tried searching for a similar thread, but didn't come up with anything."	t5_2t6ze	True
1370474957.0	1fr74e	3 small suggestions for 3 big improvements	Jonaszz	24	3	4	"The timed mode is a great addition to Duolingo, however it has some flaws namely:


###*1. Tick tick tick boom*
##*After entering a wrong answer the time keeps ticking.*

If I want to analyse what I did wrong this is being penalised. This actually leads to me skipping the step of analysing what I did wrong just to go for the score. I think I am not the only one who makes this, in my opinion wrong, choice. Duolingo should stimulate to learn from your mistakes in stead of skipping through them.

###*2. Our time is running out*
##*In timed mode it never lets you finish the last question halfway through if time runs out.*

That I am not getting a point for this doesn't matter to me, but it is very annoying when you see something which you wished to revise just on the last page and you are not allowed to finish it.

###*3. Don't look back*
##*Ever had that moment when you clicked enter two times just a bit too fast*

You are not allowed to repeat what you just did or at least see what you did wrong just a second before. Though it is nice that duolingo automatically decides what I should learn based on my mistakes and the words I unveil. Going back or at least having the data of mistakes in the last lessons accessible would be nice and a good way to learn and not make similar mistakes.

##What is your opinion on these suggestions? Or do you have other small suggestions for big improvements, drop a comment listing them.


Edit:
###*4. Still I see no changes*
##*After a fruitful discussion with other Duolingo users you are not allowed to report mistakes or additions in Duolingo.*
When you comment on something and finally see how it should be and want to correct it duo tells you to just redo the entire chapter to report it.

After doing quite a few lessons, I decided to switch to Spanish to see how I fared, having taken 4 years of Spanish in school. However, when switching back to French for today, I noticed I was making more slip-ups with French articles, and accidentally using the Spanish on occasion (usually when an answer clicked immediately in my head.... damn el and le get me the worst). Once or twice, the Spanish translation of a word came to mind as answer instead of the French, or some bastardized spelling of similar words.

My questions:

* Any one else attempting to learn two at once encounter this?
* Is it a problem that diminishes as you become more familiar with the two languages? I'm wondering if maybe I should hold off refreshing basic Spanish until I have achieved a firmer grasp on French.
* Alternatively, has knowing one helped anyone understand the either more effectively? 
* Am I just an idiot who needs to just take the lessons slowly and patiently and take a good moment to seriously consider my answers? 

**TL;DR:** Getting things like el/le and una/une switched up through speed answering easy questions while taking both Spanish and French; should I stop doing both, or will it end up coming naturally to me? Or has learning two actually helped anyone.

- Instead of comparing the percentage agreement with others, we will have each sentence graded by at least three fellow users. Because there are many ways of correctly translating each sentence, we think this will give more accurate feedback. 

- There will still be a very lenient filter to make sure your translation is not gibberish, but we will no longer take points away because you don't agree with other people. As long as your translation passes our initial filter, you will be able to move on in your learning while you wait for others to grade your sentence.

- Once enough users have graded your translation, you will get an email with a grade report, showing what others thought about your translation, along with the current best translation of the sentence.

- Because we need more human ratings per sentence to make this happen, some of the real-world exercises in the skill page path will only require you to rate (instead of both rating and translating).

- To encourage truthful rating (and also make it more fun!), you will get points only when your rating agrees with the ratings of others. If you're the first person to rate a sentence, you will get points no matter what.

This change is being tested on 50% of our users. Let us know what you think!

Infact, just about the only acceptable translation of that particular word is ""groceries"" which I've only heard people hear call it maybe once or twice (personally I think it sounds *too* American, but that's just me, sorry for being racist :P )

Anyway, this isn't a huge problem but it has been popping up around the place. It's not always as bad as the ""lebensmittel"" thing. For instance ""trousers"" is an acceptable translation of ""Hose"" but it does still say *hey, did you know another correct translation is ""pants""*. Pants, btw, would not be acceptable in British English because it means an entirely different item of clothing.

It's just, wrong if you're not American. I know this comes off as kind of anti America and things, but it is just not right and doesn't account for other variations of English which it feels like it should or at least it would be very easy to.

*Stuff that everyone should see:

1. Memrise.com
It's in the sidebar for a reason. It's an amazing tool. While Duolingo is useful for learning language structure, memrise is great for learning a large quantity of vocabulary fast.

2. Duolingo Cooking translations
On the translations tab, you can now choose categories to translate. This is probably one of the best areas to practice your knowledge from duo and mem. This is for two reasons. First, nearly every food item has its English label also in Spanish and French. Start referring to these items in F or S when you go grocery shopping. Then you will be able to apply real life to your study. Also, recipes are great in that they don't have 50 different tenses to deal with like the other pages and they are very repetitive.

However, it can be very frustrating to get a translation wrong due to some non-trivial and untaught grammar rule.

So the idea is to make implicit grammar learning less frustrating. (Providing much more explicit grammar teaching would probably cause more users to quit.)

When you are translating a sentence in a lesson, Duolingo could provide feedback in real-time while you type as to how close what you wrote is to the closest correct answer that it has in its database.

You can keep fixing your translation until there are zero errors before you press return.

This feedback would only be provided once Duolingo has determined (in an automated way) that it knows about enough correct translations."	t5_2t6ze	True
1371770336.0	1grdqd	I'm getting very frustrated with Duolingo. Am I doing something wrong or is Duo just not the method for me?	AnxiousReginald	21	6	9	"I've been using Duolingo for about one month now to learn French. Before I started I was maybe just above the level of an absolute beginner. I have learned a lot -- I'm now between level 8 and 9, and can sorta kinda make my way through newspaper articles and children's books -- but lately I've been getting more and more frustrated with the system. 

My main problem seems to be that I'm failing lessons too often. As the levels get more complicated, I will loose one or two hearts on silly things I knew already but just wasn't paying close enough attention to (maybe that's the ADD's fault). Or I will get one of the questions asking me to transcribe what the french speaker is saying, where the speaker uses a word Duo hasn't taught me before (obviously making the whole task pretty much impossible). And of course we're all familiar with the travails of translating idioms, or of submitting a translation you're pretty sure is correct only to have it rejected without explanation.  

In any case the cycle often sees me failing a lesson, getting frustrated, trying again, rushing and not paying enough attention because I'm frustrated, thus failing, getting more frustrated, trying again, etc., etc. 

Does anyone else ever feel like this?

It occurs to me that it's likely Duo is set up to make the user fail in order to create repetition, as well as to make passing a lesson feel all that much more rewarding. In that case I can only conclude that Duo is probably not the best system for me, as the frustration of failure invariably outweighs the rewards. Though maybe I'm just using it wrong, I don't know.

Whilst doing this I came to the conclusion that I have no comprehensive idea of how these work **despite** being able to get through all the lessons and achieving high levels on the practice section. 

So I'm under the impression that other people may be having the same problem but are not really aware of it as I wasn't for some time. My idea is that there be optional exams (or perhaps forced exams) at many points. In the exams you would not be able to mouse over the words to check what they mean. You would have to go for longer whilst making less few mistakes and coming into contact with a large variety of sentences which will include different cases and word orders to prove that you really understand. If you fail the site should be able to tell you what words you're slipping up on and which chapters you need to revisit to get a better grasp (assuming we don't have an exam at the end of every section)

These could be optional where participants do them out of free will, or forced such as the ""test out of"" options on the skill tree where users must get through the test out of thing to progress. 

I would really like for some sort of self assessment tool to be added, so I can start to gauge my skill level with a vague sense of accuracy. Many thanks.

I am approx 12 skills down in my tree, and just now I went back to ""Basics 2"" in Spanish to see what the translation would be like. Basics 2 in Spanish involves 18 words, including things like reading, writing, drinking, girl, boy, man etc.

I am actually genuinely interested in doing translations to help my learning. 

Is it possible to read through the text that needs to be translated, and then only match it up with a lesson if a certain percentage of the words ""should"" be able to be translated without having to mouse over. Ofcourse that means it's unlikely that on the first few lessons you do any translations at all, which gives us a good indication anyway that users are not ready to be translating text.

I started towards the end of beta and got 100-200pts per night for a couple weeks.

I continued to do it a couple times a week, but not to the extent that I did before. Also, I noticed that out of the 22 of my friends who I sent invites to, only 5 or so have actually stayed active.

I've started using Duolingo again more recently (I've found fewer mistakes and being able to disable the speakers allows me to play when I'm in a situation where I can't listen it), but I'm wondering what it's been like for other people. Can Duolingo sustain the userbase that it attracts initially?

I've been doing Spanish and while it is great, and of course necessary, to learn about conjunctions and pronouns and such, verbs are really what make a sentence happen. The fastest you can get to even the first verb lesson is after 7 other lessons, which is not that big of a deal. After doing all the lessons before that I had the present tense figured out.

But after that, it gets weird to me. After the first keyhole there are five verb lessons in the second section. Two of these are more on the present tense and 4 of them are the very last lessons.

Then, after you unlock the second keyhole it's just like VERBBSSSS EVERYWHEREEE. 14 out of the 32 lessons in the last section are all on verbs. And most of these lessons are consecutive.

It's the same thing with German and French. Except in German the first actual verb lesson doesn't come until after you've opened the first keyhole. I really don't understand this approach.

I think this method is going to be more confusing than having the verb tenses spread out throughout the whole tree. That way, combined with other lessons the tenses can sink into my brain instead of being all crammed in together at the last minute.

For example: ""Wir mögen"" can be written as ""Wir moegen"" ""Das Mädchen"" can be written as ""Das Maedchen"". ""München"" becomes ""Muenchen""

For the double-es ß you can write ""ss"". ""Ein Maß"" can be written as ""Ein Mass""

This is often used for website names that can't use non-English characters, such as www.muenchen.de

You probably wouldn't write this way by hand though.

----

If you're on a Mac computer, you can download this keyboard layout to get easy umlauts and double S: http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/USGermanKeyboard

It will be the standard U.S. keyboard layout but allow you to easily type the umlauts using the option key. So you can keep it on all the time and not have to switch keyboard layout.

Once you've followed the instructions to install the new keyboard layout, to get ü or ö or ä, just hold the option key then the corresponding letter (just like you hold shift to get a capital, and a shift+option+letter will give you Ä, Ö and Ü). To get ß I hold option then hit 's'.

I would have no problem drumming the words into my head at the beginning of every skill and then testing out. It would make progressing a lot faster. The repetition of which this method might seem to deprive me is provided later on anyway when I use the wonderful ""practice skill"" option to keep them all at four squares. Without doing this, I would quickly forget them anyway, whether I used the test-out option or not.

Yes, you press the back button on your browser to start over because you know it's not even worth it, right? Why risk time and effort if your chance of success suddenly dropped significantly ? We all know the feeling and it sucks the joy out of learning.

How can you make the system more fun and less punishing while still keeping a certain level of ""risk"" ? Personally,  I would implement a system where after a set amount of good answers you get a heart back. You could even do special streak rewards like a 4th heart slot after 10 good answers in a row or something. It would really help with those ""harder"" lessons.

As a native Spanish speaker that has taken some of the Spanish lessons I can confirm that some phrases and words sound really awkward and even differ from how people say it on the day-to-day. I'm learning French and a lot of people complain about the same on that language's discussion posts, and I imagine it happens on others aswell. 

It is a fact that nobody *likes* the robotic voice. Or at least not more than an actual person speaking. So why not have a *native* speaker for each language to record the words and sentences used on the courses? That would mean to have a person to work on and improve the oral part. If having new employees in charge of that task is by no means an option for Duolingo, which I'd understand, then try making it user generated, where people upload their recordings in a very clear and comprensible voice and a native speaker moderator simply listens and approves the correct ones. I'm more than sure that people from all around the world would be glad to contribute (I would). Thereby, instead (or additionaly) of the robotic voice, you could have a number of selected recordings from different persons (and why not regions) to listen to and compare aswell. Would something like this be viable?

I know that the speaking part is not Duo's main goal, but it would definitely increase its usefulness and would help a lot in the learning process.

I would like to read your thoughts.

**TL;DR: Hire natives to record the phrases or try a simple but strictly moderated user contribution system.**

DuoLingo then tells me I got a word wrong, but not *why* it was wrong so I know how to use it next time.

Yes the list is slightly old as Portuguese and Italian are in the 'to be added' slot, however apart from that glitch this list contains pretty much all the official information. If Duo announced they were working on a new language, this list would be up-dated. At the moment there are about three threads relating to whether or not a certain language is being added and this list is easily accessible in the side bar at all times. The Duo team does not like to speculate as they have made clear in various reddit posts (love that they use reddit so much). If they were adding any language or changing their orientation we (that's the royal ""we"" which includes you) would know. Gossip is likely to be inaccurate on this subject or based off of a meaningless comment made by a member of the Duo team. 

The Main purpose of this post is to provide the [linked](http://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/y914v/luis_von_ahn_ama_aug_14_2012_summary/) list.

1359307480.0	17ditg	"Suggestions for ""Discussion boards"" trying to promote a more active community"	goldenbunnies	13	1	7	"So I just finished mastering everything in Duolingo yesterday.  That was pretty exciting...

I really wanted to figure out a way to thank Duolingo for everything.  So when I thought back about my journey I always felt like the French Community was lacking, and I thought becoming an active community member would be a good way to pay it forward.  The community boards are always filled with questions, without enough people answering them.

Looking back at it, I think the problem is that there is very little motivation for users to post meaningful things, and there is very little deterring people from posting nonsense (e.g. [this gem from this morning](http://i.imgur.com/vHMSgt2.jpg))

I've noticed there are already little upvote/downvote buttons on every comment, so I think those should be taken a step further.  *Maybe* establish a link between those and coins, or somehow report a users total comment points.

**Reddit-ize the comments** make there be some consequences for making silly comments, and make there be a reward for answering questions.  Of course, by reward, I'm implying a karma type system that's somehow cumulative.

I ""beat"" Duolingo already so I don't care about my coins anymore, I'm just trying to think about ways to promote a positive community for the next batch of Duolingo users."	t5_2t6ze	True
1358603613.0	16viig	"[English] I need help with the expressions ""Would you mind if...?"" and ""I could/couldn't care less"""		15	3	16	"Hey native anglophones,

I'm confused about the usage of the two phrases in the title.

*""Would you mind if...?""* gets me two completely different responses from people (meaning the same thing, apparently). Examples:

 **Me:** ""Would you mind if I joined you for lunch later today?""

 **Other person:** ""No, not at all! Where do you wanna go?""

but also


**Me:** ""Would you mind if I took a picture of you?""

**Other person:** ""Oh, sure!"" *looks at the camera excitedly, smiles and poses*

I always thought ""Would you mind if..?"" meant ""Would you be bothered by it, if...?"" and thus ""No *[I would not be bothered by it.]*"" would be the way to agree to my proposal, making the first answer the only appropriate response. Weirdly, I get people agreeing to that question with ""Yes/Sure!"" quite a lot as well, which strikes me as illogical and I have to rely on reading their body language to understand how they feel.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The other thing is the phrase *""I could care less.""*. I know that people say ""I couldn't care less."" as a way of saying they don't care at all, which makes perfect sense. 

BUT often I'll hear people say ""I could care less."", which is weird, because by that they imply that it is indeed possible for them to care less about said thing and that means they **do**, in fact, care to a certain extent. Example:

**Other person:** ""He doesn't even have any real expertise in my field. I could care less what he thinks.""

**Me:**""Well, exactly. Why do you care at all, then?""

**Other person:** ""What? I just told you I didn't care.""

*awkwardness fills the room*


...sooo why are yes and no used so interchangeably in these contexts? Is there a rule that I'm overlooking? Does this phenomenon have a name, so I can learn more about it?

If you go to ""Control Panel"", then ""Clock, Language, and Regional settings"", then ""change keyboards or other input methods""


* You'll then click on ""change keyboards""


* This will bring up a screen in which you can add keyboards to your existing layout:  for instance, I have the US-english standard keyboard.  I then added US-International.


* After that, you go to the advanced key settings tab and click on the international keyboard and then click ""change key sequence"" 


* This will bring up a prompt, click ""enable key sequence"" default Ctrl + 0
and then click on ""apply"" and then ""ok""


What this does is enable you to switch to a keyboard with shortcuts for umlauts and accent marks.


To test it, open a word document, then hit your key sequence and type "" followed immediately by an o


If it comes out as an ö, then you've done it correctly!    


This works with all umlauts and accents ÄäËëïÏöÖüÜ  íÍáÁ etc.  Also, I know there exists a shortcut for ß which is: right alt + s


You may want to enable a key sequence on both your default and international keyboards so that you can switch between them without having to close and open a new browser or document.


I know that was a bit long, but I hope it helps!

Danke!

I don't let myself go on from a lesson until I get max hearts. Then, once I get max hearts on every lesson and pass the mastery test, I'll make flash cards for all of the new words in that unit. Then I make myself learn all of those words and verb conjugations so that they're second nature before I move on to another lesson. Is this an effective way to go about it or am I getting ahead of myself? How do you get the most out of the system.	t5_2t6ze	True
1354762763.0	14d1u2	Why not concentrate on the most frequently used words?	Chodarth	13	1	3	"Is there a reason Duolingo is not trying to teach, say, the 2000 most frequently used words in each language? Some of the words I'm learning are not even in my 5,000 word frequency dictionary. Do I really need to know the word for ""the count""? When am I ever going to use this? 

Also, why is there such a large focus on cognates?

His use of Anki to learn several languages is amazing and working very well for me. If Duolingo adopted some of his ideas it would greatly improve the site.

I was working on DuoLingo when I came across the German translate question: ""Ich habe keine guten Freunde."" I translated this to ""I have no good friends"" which was marked as incorrect. Possible correct solutions were ""I don't have any good friends"" and ""I do not have any good friends."" 

Is there an English grammar rule I am missing or is DuoLingo wrong? My mind is in turmoil trying to decide if ""I have no ______"" is grammatically correct or not. I can think of some common phrases such as ""I have no idea"" or ""I have no intention."" ""I have no pretzels"" - does that sentence sound weird? 

Is it proper to use ""I have no ______ "" with abstract nouns and ""I don't have ______"" with physical objects?

1343739097.0	xg2wd	Suggestion: Reviewing answers	Ateisti	11	0	2	"I started to refresh my Spanish a few days ago with Duolingo, and I'm loving it so far. I only have one complaint/suggestion.

I usually go through the lessons as fast as I can, using only the keyboard. Whenever I encounter a simple sentence (one I'm sure I know how to translate correctly), I just type it fast and then press enter twice to get to next question. Naturally I sometimes get the answer wrong (e.g. miss an accent), but then I don't have enough time to see what went wrong, and I've left to wonder if I actually got it wrong or if I just made a small typo in my answer.

A couple of ways this could be corrected:

* When a user enters a wrong answer, pressing enter doesn't immediately skip to the next question (e.g. you'd have to press space instead or something).
* The user can at any time review the answer they gave to the previous question (or questions), and whether it was correct or not. For example by hovering the mouse over the green bar at the top, a tooltip could pop up saying something like: ""Question #2. Your answer: xyz, Correct Answer: yxz"". Parts of the bar could also be red for those questions the user got wrong, so it would be easy to review all wrong answers at the end.

CerealYum	14	3	5	"Since children learn languages easier, i think duolingo would be perfect for kids. just about 15 minutes a day, and coupled with another program (like memrise for vocab), they would have a firm grip on the language by the time they graduate high school.

I just thought I'd offer some initial observations. 

I had difficulty using the first ""shortcut"" to advance quickly in French. This didn't offend me at all, but having five years of French experience, I was flying through the basic lessons (the parts of the test that gave me trouble were the listening and specific vocabulary, like ""whale"").

However, when I tried the shortcut on the iOS app, I was very easily able to place up to level 5 and to level 7 as well. I fear that I may have ""cheated"". I didn't Google anything or use any translator; the shortcut just seemed easier on iOS. For example, the inclusion of a word bank on the ""translate"" questions made things much easier.

1358642588.0	16wk3y	Idea: Speaking Translation practice.	stevesiphon	10	0	2	"As a whole, I am impressed with Duolingo in almost every department of learning.  Since starting the Spanish course I have noticed that my reading and writing skills have improved by leaps and bounds. However, my speaking skills are still horrendous.  I find that when I try to speak with one my Spanish speaking friends I am unable to remember words when I need them. In order for me to be able to truly learn vocabulary words  I need to practice using them in a conversation.

One possible remedy could be advanced speaking translations.  Duolingo could give an English(in my case) sentence and have users speak their Spanish translation into the microphone.  I know this would be a difficult addition to the current lesson structure and could potentially be very error prone.  Instead of being part of the lessons this type of format could be used as a standalone practice session in each section. The simple act of having to speak a sentence in Spanish that is not provided by Duolingo will help users actively remember vocabulary in a conversation.  Currently I find myself just reading the Spanish sentences out loud with little active thinking on my part.  

I do not have any studies to point to to back up my Idea, only personal experience. I understand that Duolingo is in the business of having users translate text into text.  They have little incentive to focus on speaking skills.  However, I feel that the lack emphasis on speaking skills is what keeps Duolingo from being a stellar language learning system.  For now, I guess I'll have to settle with it being good and using some other resources(such as Verbling) to supplement this deficiency.

Je suis ce qu'on appellerait un apprenant 'avancé' (dans le système DELF/DALF j'suis C1/C2) de la langue française, et j'utilise Duolingo pour me rafraîchir la mémoire des fondamentaux de la langue (les choses qui m'ont embrouillées quand j'étais jeune). C'est une très bonne experience, et j'aime presque tout ce qui est sur le site sauf le suivant:

Je sais pas si c'est à cause du fait que Duolingo est en version bêta, mais le plus que j'avance l'arbre de compétences, le plus que mes réponses correctes sont réfusées. C'est tellement véner de ne pas pouvoir progresser quand j'suis sûr que ma réponse est correcte. J'ai le luxe de vivre dans un pays francophone (la Suisse-Romande) et d'être entouré d'étudiants bilingues qui font leurs masters et ils confirmaient que mes réponses sont bonnes, plus qu'une fois.

Peut-être que c'est la nature ambiguë de la langue française, ou qu'il y a moins d'essais sur ces niveaux plus avancés, mais j'envoie constamment des réponses alternatives sans accusé de réception...enfin y avait UNE fois que j'ai reçu une réponse par email. J'ai lu dans l'AMA de Luis qu'environs 75% de réponses alternatives n'ont pas raison...mais j'ai l'impression qu'ils sont un peu trop stricts par rapport à ce qui est correct et ce qui n'est pas.

Bref, est-ce qu'il y a d'autres entre vous qui ont le même problème ?

___________________________________________________________________________________________

I am I guess what one would call an 'advanced' French speaker/learner (In the European system I am C1/C2), and have been using Duolingo more as a refresher of all my basic stuff (some of which is stuff that I never fully got my head around as a child!). It has been a wonderful experience, and I love almost everything about the site, except this:

I'm not sure whether it's the fact that French is in Beta, but the higher I get up the skill tree I repeatedly enter correct translations that are rejected as being wrong. It is very frustrating to not be able to progress when I know for sure that my answer is correct. I have the luxury of living in French-speaking Switzerland and being surrounded by bilingual masters students, and they have confirmed my answers more than once now!

I'm not sure whether it is just the ambiguous nature of the French language, or whether less testing has been done on these higher levels, but I constantly send in possible alternative answers and have only received feedback of their receipt once. I read in Luis' AMA that around 75% of alternative answers are wrong, but I feel that perhaps they are being too strict as to what will be considered 'right' and 'wrong'.

Anyway, anyone else having these problems?

1353740208.0	13peyl	Feedback on Duolingo	SquareWheel	14	3	23	"Hi there,

I've been using Duolingo for about two weeks now.  Still really early for feedback perhaps, but I thought a noobies take on it might be of value.

I learned of Duolingo when the iPhone app came out so that's what I've been using.  The app is incredibly polished, the dev's did a fantastic job.

I realized I could do the lessons on the site earlier too and have done a couple lessons that way.  It's neat how it has voice recognition, surprised it doesn't work on my iPod Touch.  The fact that the two interfaces sync perfectly is just great.

Anyway, I'm trying to learn French and am finding that a few things are more difficult than I think they need to be.  Primarily that's that the Duolingo program doesn't appear to teach you the ""rules"" of the language.

Not once has it explained when to use 'tu' vs 'vous', or 'mange' vs 'manges'.  Or when you should put a 'du' or 'des' into a sentence you're translating to French.  It just expects you to know when to use each version of the word.  It feels a bit like watching the pieces of a chess board move and trying to guess at the rules of the game.

I feel that a larger focus on teaching the rules of the language and not just letting you know when you're right or wrong would greatly enhance the program.  A friend explained that pronouns affect the suffixes of verbs, but had she not known I'd never have figured that out.  That's my biggest complaint thus far.

The only other issue I'd suggest is that the text-to-speech is too fast.  You can't tell where one word ends and the next word begins.  I don't think it's just due to my untrained ear either as the Google Translate tool speaks in a slower, more understandable voice.  The ""transcribe spoken french to written french"" challenges are the most difficult to me for this reason.

That said, this is such a great service.  I've recommended it to friends, given it 5 stars on the app store.  Really well done.

---

Oh, and I may have found an exploit at one point.  I had a lesson which only had a single challenge in it.  If I completed the challenge and relaunched the lesson it was the same challenge over and over again.  Really easy to exploit for the 4 coins each time.  I don't really care about the gamification aspect but it sounds like something to be fixed.  After doing a different lesson it fixed itself.

Looking forward to learning more French, and hopefully identifying when to use Vous vs Tu.  I'm still not sure!"	t5_2t6ze	True

I receive the coins, but when I return to the lessons they aren't marked as completed.

Sometimes when I retry the translation it will randomly complete and I will receive double the coins.  So on the translation page I will only receive 11 coins, but when I return to my home page, I see that my coins for the day has gone up by 22 even though I only completed 1 translation.  So in total I will receive 3x the coins (1 for original attempt and 2 more when it finally takes)

This past Tuesday I did 6 lessons + 6 translations and suddenly noticed my coins were at 196 (which just doesn't add up) and all of my translations were being accepted.

It would be nice if this could be fixed... Ever since the translations became mandatory I've used them to gauge how much I've practiced each lesson.  So I do 1 practice then 1 translation, but now I can't tell how much I've practiced a lesson, and it is becoming very discouraging to even do the translations because I use coins to tell how much I've learned in a day and now there is a lot of coin inflation and I'm not receiving any progress towards mastering skills etc.


**TL;DR** I do a translation, but it doesn't get marked as completed until I randomly try again some other time... I am getting discouraged in translations because my coins are inflated and I can't track my progress."	t5_2t6ze	True

So why not provide users with the option to see the DuoBot translation to help them out? The cost would be that they would not earn as many credits and maybe Duolingo would not have others rate it (to avoid biasing other peoples' translations).

Anyway, I started learning French in secondary school (aged 11) and continued to to AS-Level after I went to college (around 17) but between then and now (age 23) I've had no formal teaching. 

In fact, it is only recently I've really taken an interest in picking the language up again, so that I've not 'wasted' those 6 years of my life. Ideally, I'd like to be conversational in French - I'm not looking for perfect fluency at all.

So here is my question; how much can I actually 'learn' with Duolingo? There isn't an awful lot of teaching, it seems to more be continued testing and if you manage to pass congratulations if not keep trying until you've memorised all the possible questiosn from that  'lesson' along with their respective answers. 

Is this really a good way to learn? Will I find it getting harder and harder as I progress and will I spend more and more of my time just learning the answers rote rather than understanding what's going on? 

Or is this actually a good way to learn; will all of this stuff sink in and I am learning without actually realising?

I've mastered over half of the Spanish lessons and I'm at level 13 but my listening skills are still absolutely terrible. 90% of the time, I have to slow down the voice on the listening parts of the lessons. I took to watching the Spanish version of the Simpsons online and it's just too fast for me. I've been watching an episode a day for the last 8 or 9 days now and I'm really just not understanding anything. I was hoping that I'd start picking things up quickly but I don't think I'm making any improvements at all. Even episodes that I've seen, I can't make out what they're saying, a word every few minutes or so maybe, but not enough that I know what's actually being said.

I think this would be incredibly helpful for expanding vocabularies as well as helping native speakers show non natives understand the normal speech patters of native speakers. not to mention it would make it easier for conversing in the language you are trying to learn.

Using Firefox mobile, if I zoom in, it automatically centers the page. So I can't zoom in on the login fields (in the upper right of the start page), because it keeps centering the page, hiding the fields. When I finally log in and try to practice, I get redirected to data input immediately, so I have to go back to see what the question was.

So far I am enjoying it, mostly the 'Pick up and play' aspect. I just load it up on the browser and it's there as opposed to firing up a whole bespoke application. In fact i leave a browser window on with my duolingo homepage on it!  
 I have tried to use Rosetta stone in the past but found it a bit boring and WAY too repetitive.

I have found this system realises that you will probably remember the word for 'Bread' and will then show you how its used in sentences. Also the mix of reading/writing/listening is refreshing as opposed to sitting down and saying 'Oh, I'll just be listening today..'

The points system coupled with the social media aspect also makes it fun - I currently have 6 people to follow and 3 following me, which pitches me into a league table with them.

The translating section is the big selling point of this site/service, as it shows you how the language will be used in the real world both formally and informally - My only gripe about this is that sometimes its hard to translate a sentence without context (i.e. the sentence before), but I guess that will fade with practise!

I have mixed feelings on the 'Stream' only allowing you to type in your target language.. Although I think its cool, at this level I'm having trouble working out what others are saying.. especially if they are a lot more advanced in the language as me. Again, Once I am fluent in all three this won't bother me! But the option to write in English would be cool aswell.

My aim in doing this is.. well purely selfish and materialistic - I'm between jobs at the moment, and I reckon that having another language under my belt will tip the scales in my favour when applying to competitive positions. 

Re-reading the above, I'm mostly pointing out features, and I hope that through use I will be able to expand on the above - I have only mastered German Basics 1 and completed Basic 2. Hopefully it may spark interest in others to give it a go. For the current users, My nick on there is the same as on here, and I do have a few invites for those who would like to try.

At the moment is if you want to practice your vocabulary. you have two options

Timed practise - rewarded more highly but i often find myself running out of time pretty early on and maximum get to about 7-8 questions in,

Non timed practise- easier option but if you lose all three hearts then you receive no reward for practising, 

In my opinion the practice mode could be better implemented -  where you are awarded a point when you get a wrong answer , but if you get a wrong answer you dont loose a life you simply get fail the question and see the explanation for the answer. After failing this question it should be made more likely to reoccur in the future,

I suppose a bit more like the memrise appraoach, where after failure you are corrected and allowed to continue, without punishment

Obviously for the main lesson i still agree with the hearts system

Sorry if this doesnt make sense its late and im cant seem to put what i mean into words properly


TLDR ; non 'punishment' for failure on practice mode, it is practice afterall... can be quite frustrating doing a practice weakest words for 3-4 goes and not getting any lovely coins :)

EDIT : had a bit more of a think about it... so what im trying to say i see duolingo a bit like an RPG game, where doing the tree is like doing the main quests, you gain experience and are able to further go on with the game.. buts is not always so easy to progress..

Practicing vocabulary is the equivalent of ,farming,hunting wild bores in the woods where you are trying to improve your skills so you can get further in the game.. but at the moment you could actually spend a good time farming and not actually get much experience 'ie coins' 

And i know for myself im not quite incentivised to practice my vocab if the same amount of time i could collect coins through skill tree lessons...

I that the practice in itself is useful whether i earn coins or not.. but its the rpg style coin gathering which keeps me coming back to duolingo for more and at the moment practice vocab doesnt really do this for me

rant over :)

- Some quirks: At one point I went into a phrase discussion and perhaps I clicked around a bit to impatiently, ended up landing the gui in a weird state.

For example, the direct translation of ""yo como el almuerzo"" is ""I eat the lunch"" when in English you would say ""I eat lunch"". So from this I thought that maybe the ""el"" is always required.

1357659724.0	166qw2	An idea for making translations more educational, higher quality, and much less work.	amichail	12	5	0	"As with my previous post, learners would improve existing translations rather than write ones from scratch. Initial translations would be created by bots.

However, to take this idea further, Duolingo could automatically remove certain sentence fragments from an existing translation and the learner would be informed of where those removals are. So now the learner fills in these fragments and tries to improve the rest of the sentence. He/she would receive credit only if others judge the result to be an improvement over the previous translation (without the fragments removed).

Duolingo could decide which fragment(s) to remove from an existing translation in clever ways:

* if translations of a sentence tend to vary in certain part(s), then Duolingo could remove those to focus on where the problem(s) are

* to better support learners at different skill levels, Duolingo could remove easy fragments for beginners and harder ones for more advanced learners; moreover, advanced learners could be required to fill in more fragments per sentence

* for translations that are part of lessons, Duolingo could remove fragments that involve vocabulary from those lessons

[a screenshot of new translation pages](http://imgur.com/zWIqj)

Some feedback for the DuoLingo team. I like it because:

* 1. New elements give it more of a game/competitive feel, eg. the top translators section to the right, the profile pic of the top translators for a sentence.
* 2. This layout makes your feel like you're working towards the completion of a document (giving the task a goal), rather than just translating sentences. Also, it shows more how this completion is a community effort.
* 3. No more of those wonky sliding windows. I really saw no need for those.
* 4. Now you get to see the context of the text better, with side by side translations. Language learning is always better in context.
* 5. More prominent feedback sections, eg. directly at the end of the post, and the comment section to the right.

What I don't like:

* 1. You can't see for which section your earning points. Often I would only translate sentences that earn more than just 'skill points'. There's no indication on the new pages. This may be a good thing for Duolingo considering the old set up was rewarding a 'bad practice' of translating only for points. 
* 2. You can't edit immediately after making a translation. You must reload the page before you can edit again. Immediate editing helps, because sometimes you see a better translates and would like to 'clean up' your own translation.

I sent her a laptop with ubuntu and an opendns keyword and domain filter that would frustrate the pope. If she needs to get somewhere anywhere on the internet she has to pay me in skill points.

I have no experience actually studying any of the three given.

I don't really have an interest in learning Spanish, although I do live in America where it's widely spoken.

While I HAVE studied German somewhat in the past, and can somewhat read it, and speak words written (although having no knowledge of what they mean). I just haven't ever really seen it spoken where I'm from or have that big of an interest learning it. Especially since I'm very passionate about language learning and spend a lot of energy focusing on it when I do.

While I'm interested in French, I can't pronounce anything in French, and don't understand how to even read anything written in French. I'd love to learn French, but am not sure how well Duolingo works at teaching grammar rules etc. (I've never tried it).

My little bit of a background though is I taught myself Greek Fluently (but was influenced later by actually living in Greece where I am from - so that helped), and always had a passion for studying languages, especially Eastern European languages (I can read and write Cyrillic, and as well as speak very basic Russian).

1338814725.0	uk4i7	(request) Hello there, fellow Reddit peoples, I have some questions.	MrSomethingHeroic	8	1	12	"Hi everyone, 

I signed up for duolingo because I have a lot of hope for this type of program and think it is quite unique and fascinating. I have been interested in learning French, Italian, and Spanish for quite some time now and ultimately decided to start with French because it is the most unknown to me and half of my family speaks it on my dad's side, go figure. 

Anyhow, I have a few questions about starting the program:

* **1]** Do I need an invite, even though I have signed up on duolingo.com or am I just waiting for a confirmation email to come to me? If the former is the case, how do I get one?

* **2]** When it says that ""## days are left until the dawn of a new era"", is it talking about some sort of official launch, or is it going to change the program in some way?


* **3]** For those who are already using it, how is it going for you? Are the concepts of the program simple enough to understand and moving at a suitable pace for your learning style? 

I feel as though my understanding of English and Basic Latin principals will help me through the courses as French is a Latin based language, but I would like to know what other people are feeling about it?

I really thank everyone for their future comments and hope to hear from you soon! Until then, keep learning! 

A hungry mind is a luxury that many do not possess and having the determination to feed it is a power none can contain.

**T.L.;D.R.** Do I need an invite or confirmation email? What does ""dawn of a new era"" mean? How is the program going for you? Keep Learning!

Thanks Redditors this community never ceases it to fascinate me. =)

**EDIT:** Wow thank you all for the info and the invite offers, I must offer my deepest thanks though to erikANGRY for being the first person to extend their invite offer to me. I have since given two of mine away already.

I am loving the program and see it as a life changing opportunity. You all are fantastic thanks again. =)"	t5_2t6ze	True

Translate these sentences from your language to target language or the other way around:

She bought an apple and ate it.

These sentences would be different from the sentences used in the lessons at least enough so you aren't repeating a whole sentence you have memorized. You would need to make your own sentences. I'm not sure how long you could make these or would want to as there could be a lot of variety in correct responses and the program may have a hard time knowing all of the correct answers.

I guess my question is, how do new language learners grasp the concept and understanding of a language when it's so difficult to comprehend the words that are spoken? And how do you keep up the motivation to learn when it seems like such a daunting task?

Just an idea I had and even if Duolingo didn't pick it up I would be keen to program something along those lines.

Any thoughts on this possibility from the community? Pros/Cons etc.? 


**EDIT**: After some more thought I suppose what I am proposing is I suppose what I am proposing is the possibility of a website that can teach:

**Music Theory:**

Score reading, Tab Reading, Basic Theory, Solfege, Harmony and Counterpoint, Composition etc. etc.

**Instruments:**

A range of Instruments from Guitar, Flute, Voice, Harmonica, Ukulele (Pretty much any instrument that exists) So you have a tool which to use to teach yourself instruments in a similar way to how Duolingo teaches languages

**Sound Engineering:**

It could also offer basics and more advance lessons in sound mixing, acoustic set ups, live mixing etc. etc.

So basically anything and everything to do with music and sound production.

Feel free to give me your thoughts on this? (This being the backup plan if Duolingo doesn't want anything to do with it).

When dealing with plural possessive pronouns, Duolingo seems to think that they agree with the possessing subject, rather than the possessed direct object.  For example, take the following sentence:

Ses livres sont grands.  

Unless I'm mistaken, 'ses' is used for singular possessing subjects (his/her/its), when possessing a plural object. Unfortunately, Duolingo will mark you wrong if you interpret it in this way.  In other words, while 'ses' is only used to indicate a plural noun (direct object) being possessed, Duolingo thinks it indicates a plural subject as well.  This would be indicated correctly by 'leur' or 'leurs'.  

**tl;dr** Duolingo confuses 'ses' with 'leurs'

I just started learning on Duolingo thanks to a generous redditor that gave me an invite. I am wondering if there is any simple way to view my history of translated snippets so that I won't forget or do you guys suggest opening a word document and writing everything there?

Thank you!"	t5_2t6ze	True
