Even the weakest episodes (s2e01 for example) have plenty of heart and a lot of hilarious moments.  The show reaches peaks many others only dream of (invisible gunfights?).  It's definitely the best show of people just 'hanging out' I can think of.

When the Americans insisted on segregated pubs the British refused. When white Americans came in and saw black Americans drinking in a bar they would start fights and the British fought alongside the black Americans.

Ronni then talks about US propaganda films showing a white US soldier and a black US soldier meeting an old British lady and invites both of them around for tea, so the film prepared soldiers for the non-racist treatment the British gave to American soldiers.

I watched this series for the first time back in 2009 or so, and having just rewatched it it's amazing the amount of depth in references that has gone into it when you really look.

A few key ones I just noticed were in the 2nd to last episode of Series 2 they reference the very beginning of the series in a few hilarious way.

1) they reference Mike's love for clubbing when after Daisy's dinner he repeatedly suggest they go clubbing.

2) Daisy throws her keys onto a shaggy and velma bust on the desk at home referencing when there was a moment that Tim compared himself to Freddie and Daisy herself to Daphnie and when the camera zoomed out it showed Tim and Daisy standing in what could only be conceived as Shaggie and Velma type clothes.

3) Marsha says ""I got you a present for your anniversary, both of them!"" Referencing the beginning of the series when Tim says they have two anniversaries, tim counts from when they first kissed and Daisy counts from when they first became intimate, from when they were caught in a potential breach of their lie.

*Apparently it was just 4OD being the usual high-quality streaming site we've come to expect. Although reports are mixed, many have said it works for them and there was a repeat shown on 4seven. Go try the 4od video if you're in the UK.*

**Original Post**

I thought I'd bring this up because I was about 16 minutes into watching it, (having already heard what I assume to be the ""distasteful"" joke Jack Whitehall made regarding her Maj), and the video suddenly breaks down to buffer like crazy. Figuring it was just 4od being, well, 4od, I refreshed the page and was treated to BFQotY 2011 instead.

The [link posted earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishTV/comments/15rym4/big_fat_quiz_of_the_year_2012/) in this subreddit has been blocked by C4 copyright for myself (and at least one other, judging by the thread comments) so has someone found an unofficial place to watch it and is willing to share? I'm pretty sure YouTube is going to be closely monitored for a while.

***If you could, upvote this for visibility? I really want to watch the remainder of BFQotY 2012 and I highly doubt C4 are going to broadcast a repeat tomorrow. If someone finds and posts a working link in the comments, it'll be easy for others to find too.*** 

*Super special awesome edit for the troglodyte in the comments that made a big thing about me not using the full name of the show anywhere in this post...*

*BFQotY stands for ""Big Fat Quiz of the Year"", and you'd have known that if you followed the link in this post to the comments thread of the other post* "	t5_2rzot	True

Sounds vague, and probably shit. But it isn't, it's alright, and with proper development and funding it will be incredible.

You can watch the original series on YouTube to get a flavour of the characters and setup of the show. The pilot will pick up where this left off. Please have a watch and if you like, share or even donate to our Kickstarter to help fund the pilot.

We are just a young group of lads trying to get things going as we have a real opportunity with a major production company and we are very close to being legit.

Today I had myself a crowning moment of awesome regarding Father Ted. I work as a performer for a local Renaissance Faire in my native state of New Jersey. My character is a ""Used Horse Salesman"" who desperately tries to get as many horses sold within in the day. I was looking for inspiration in some new material for my character. I realized that a while back I had watched the episode of Father Ted (which I have to say, it's funny) where they wrote a song for Eurosong '96 called ""My Lovely Horse."" I thought to myself, ""Wow! I would love to use this song to sing to the patrons!"" Halfway through the faire, I came across some children who were looking for a clue in a scavenger hunt, so their task was to sing a song to achieve their clue. I told them I have a song called ""My Lovely Horse"" and they should sing-along with me. So, I gathered up an audience and asked a random couple to witness the performance. After my rousing rendition of the song, and giving my clues to the children, the couple came over to me and asked if that song was from Father Ted. I excitedly said (without trying not to break character) ""Yes! How did you get that reference?"" They both replied, ""We're from England!"" The three of us talked about the episode and Eurovision (yes, I watch Eurovision too). That was a very exciting moment for me, and I would like to say ""Thank You Father Ted!"" This is why I love to entertain people because you will never know what will happen. 

TL;DR: I'm an American who used the Eurovision Episode of ""Father Ted"" and happened to sing ""My Lovely Horse"" in front of a couple who happened to be from England, and I realized why I love to perform. 

Thanks from the USA!

UPDATE: Thanks for all of your suggestions for the songs about horses. Sadly, today was our last day of the faire and it was a wild success! I can not wait for next year and hopefully take in some of your sugesstions for the ""Used Horse Salesman."" Thanks again!"	t5_2rzot	True

From Wikipedia: ""Brian Edward Cox, OBE (born 3 March 1968) is a British particle physicist, a Royal Society University Research Fellow and a professor at the University of Manchester. He is a member of the High Energy Physics group at the University of Manchester, and works on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland. He is also working on the R&amp;D project of the FP420 experiment in an international collaboration to upgrade the ATLAS and the CMS experiment by installing additional, smaller detectors at a distance of 420 metres (1,380 ft) from the interaction points of the main experiments.""

**TL;DR: He is a respected scientist... you don't get to be a Professor at a top university and work on the Large Hadron Collider by being in a shit band. And what, exactly, is so wrong with science being relayed to a lay audience in an effective and entertaining way? Why the hate?**

1361233520.0	18s9vj	The documentary that was on ITV tonight about Aylesbury prison is not an accurate depiction of what life's like in that prison.	HMP_AMA	55	10	17	"If you're looking for an insight into British prisons then don't bother with this documentary because it's very misleading. They didn't even get the title right. It's HMYOI Aylesbury (Her Majesty's young offenders institute) not HMP. 

I know it's inaccurate because I spent quite a while there. I did an AMA about it a few months ago, specifically to do with Aylesbury.

They made out like it's a non stop battle royal in there and it's just not. Obviously there's a bit of violence but not nearly as much as you'd imagine from watching this.

They only showed a handful of prisoners and all but one were complete twats, the very worst people in Aylesbury. The one prisoner they interviewed who wasn't (Josh, I think) seemed like an alright bloke, and that's what most people in prison are like, they're like Josh. The twats they showed are the exception not the other way round like this documentary shows.

I recognised half the officers, all the ones I saw were top blokes. Some of the one's with blurred out faces are the ones who aren't. Well, they might just be blurred for privacy, which is fair enough. But I still recognised a few of them, the big burly brutal ones who were worse than most of the prisoners when it comes to being violent. I'm guessing but I'll bet that's why at least a few of the officers in this are blurred out, because the few blurred one's I recognised were those ones.

The point is that just like any group of people, but especially in an environment like this, you get a few bastards. Both prisoners and officers alike. But watching this documentary anyone would think most of the prisoners are all violent lunatics (which there are a few of, but also including officers) and all the officers are just normal people (which most of them are, and so are the prisoners).

The violence was overplayed massively, that's all they focus on. Doesn't tell you anything about life in HMYOIs, simply because violent incidents don't happen that often. Maybe once a month tops, usually not even that. I can be certain about this being the case over the whole prison because when ever there was a fight or whatever all the officers were told by radio and all ran to stop it. Very noticeable and an unusual event. But from watching this you'd think it was all constant carnage and that's just not the case at all.

I thought anyone here who watched it looking to see what HMYOIs are like should know that that's not what you're going to get from this documentary. Sensationalist rubbish is what you'll get on the most part.

I was looking forward to watching it, very disappointed. It's a 2 parter so maybe the next one will be better but I'm not getting my hopes up."	t5_2rzot	True

1334490905.0	sap33	Hello. I'm plugging my new subreddit.

The iPlayer and YouTube and all of those other streaming services are fantastic for their scope of selection, but I often find myself feeling a little lost when trawling through their massive catalogues. One of the best things about flicking the telly on is how it dictates your watching agenda. When I have too many options I turn into an indecisive nervous wreck.

With that in mind, I've created a new subreddit that will hopefully help people in the UK discover great movies available to watch for free online. There really is a lot of stuff out there to be viewed for free, the main issue is finding it. It could be like a LoveFilm subscription for skint people. I'd like to see it become a subreddit of content curated by redditors with links to films that are actually worth a watch.

The only problem is that there are only a handful of links over there at the moment. If you have anything you think is worth sharing then please pop over and post it. Whether it's an artsy indie or an explodey blockbuster, if it's legal and can be viewed on a British ISP then it's welcome on /r/ukfreemovies.

1328342581.0	pag1q	Why do I like BritishTV?	rick_2047	44	5	30	"This is not an essay about why I like British TV. Its a serious question because for the life of me, I cannot figure out why I like British TV better than American TV.

I like watching TV shows. That is a fact everybody knows. I am an Indian and Indian Television sucks. Its the same story repeated in every show. I started loving watching TV shows a few years back when my mind had a very personal big bang due to the internet. I got exposed to the really great shows, all of them were American. Started with Numb3rs then friends then how I met your mother and the list goes on. In November 2011 I discovered Sherlock. I used to love the books (still do) as a child. I have read almost everything and watched everything related to Sherlock Holmes. So I thought it was my duty to watch this too. I was bloody floored. This was so awesome. Then I started watching other British TV shows (which I got from the list of shows broadcasted on BBC One). I was hooked. 

Now I am sure I love British TV more than American one. But I can't pinpoint why. I am not the kind of person who is into analyzing the shows he watches. I don't really go around and read a lot about art of TV show making. But I just need to know why I love British TV more than the American one. Here are some ballpark guesses.

1. **British TV has balls:** Although they may not have that much of offensive language as American TV has, they have the balls to show things as they really are. They do not sugarcoat stuff. Like last night I was watching an Episode of Hustle. Its about con men, but the good type. You know...the type which rips off only rich people who are not honest. The line ""You cannot con a honest person"" is repeated many times throughout the show. But in Season 1 Episode 5 they accidentally destroy a honest man's life. If it were American TV (like their show Leverage), in the last 5 minutes they would have solved the problem and the honest man would have been saved. But that is not how it works. Once a con is setup and in the finale you cannot revert the consequences (at least not in the con which they ran). They had the balls show it exactly like that. 

2. **British culture resonates with me:** Although I am now very familiar with the American culture, Europe is more closely related to India in terms of culture. For example, Americans are fanatics about their religious preferences. They practically define themselves using that. That shows in most of the US comedies where fun is made using the religious stereotypes. But this is not true for British TV. They focus more on the character's individual traits rather than the stereotype. I really like that.

3. **Its just fresh, it will ware off:** Maybe I am just bored of watching the same kind of shit and this is fresh. Maybe it will just pass over and I would start to see both on the same level.

4. **Its not about love stories:** I like a romantic angle as much as the next guy, but you don't have to put one in every freaking thing. US TV does that way too often. All the British TV I have watched has been conservative about these things. There may be hint to romantic angles but it never becomes the focus of a whole episode.

So what am I getting wrong and what am I missing out on?"	t5_2rzot	True

Originally posted this in /r/fatherted and I thought there must be some FT fans here too. 

I am a big Father Ted fan and have been listening to various TV shows I have loved as audio to help me get to sleep or make my transit more happy. It is also quite nice to listen to it while you exercise or go about doing activities. 

Originally found out about it from here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/smg7l/in_an_effort_to_lose_some_weight_i_ripped_seasons/

I've uploaded the whole show categorised as folders and with episode names (taken from wikipedia) on MEGA.co.nz. With each link, you can download it as a .zip file if you right click the folder name on the left hand side sidebar. 

All the tracks have had replay gain adjusted so the volumes aren't unexpected. They were all ripped from Youtube. 

[**Series 1**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!B1RAwbZZ!BlQEpzra9P8IP_leCtD__A
)

[**Series 2**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!R8YFASYC!X80U6BTaVYpyArb4TIpRuw
)

[**Series 3**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!pgwCFYDa!fSiVWR-V8HgGqglhBYIVMg
)

Would be happy to hear if it works for you. 

Hope this is within the rules of this sub. 

Right so, cup of tea then?

(I'll list the ones I've seen and loved inside.)	angelsins	42	12	142	"Shows I've seen (also, please correct me if any of them aren't actually British, and just have all British casts):

* Doctor Who (everything since it restarted with Eccleston)
* Torchwood
* Secret Diary of a Call Girl
* The Tudors
* Game of Thrones (I have one more episode to watch)

Not sure if it counts as a show, since they were mini-series, but I also saw Single Father and Casanova with David Tennant, and the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.

I'm currently in the middle of watching Sherlock, I think I have the second season to go now. I also want to try out Camelot and Merlin. Anything else I should look into trying? I love historical, fantasy, and sci-fi, but other suggestions welcome as well. (I'm Canadian if you are wondering or care.)
