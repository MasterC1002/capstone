1360772137.0	18g8ei	Saddest Country Songs Ever Written	thechickenslave	52	4	71	"Alright guys and gals, we all know that country music is good for many things. You can drink to it, love to it, drive to it. In my opinion, however, country music is just about at its best when it's sad. The steel guitar, the fiddle, and the whine of a good song can make you cry better than anything out there.

So what all do you guys consider the ""saddest country songs""? I'm interested to hear, and I'll leave a very small list of my own.

It has gone the route of the rock music industry, where music producers look for bands that make easy-to-swallow garbage for idiots. Songs like Chicken Fried aren't clever with lyrics; they literally just list off things that their target audience might like in hopes of making a hit, and subsequently, some serious coin. It's played relentlessly on country radio in an attempt by the corporate media to train the listeners what to like. So I ask you, country music fans of Reddit, am I crazy? And why can't country music be like it was in the 90's? I miss Garth Brooks, Alabama, Brooks &amp; Dunn, George Straight, Tim McGraw before he got all preachy, Toby Keith before he got all crazy about patriotism, Travis Tritt... 

tl;dr anyone else sick of the mainstream, cold beer on a Friday night, pair of jeans that fit just right, Church on Sunday mornin', sweet tea on the front porch, tailgate sittin' God preachin', crawdad fishin', dirt road, Georgia muddin', ""I just wanna cry"", state of the country music scene?

1330533226.0	qbgxe	A humble request for the great people that submit to this under appreciated subreddit.	Sariel007	20	0	6	"Please put title and artist in the title. I ask this for two reasons 

1. Most of the time I will do a quick search before submitting a song/link to make sure someone else did not submit it. So if I search for ""Crazy Girl by Eli Young Band"" I am not going to find it if your title is ""This was the first song we danced to at the wedding reception."" 

2. There are artists/bands that I do not like and/or songs that I do not like. If the title tells who/what it is I can decide if I want to listen to it or not rather than go in blind. (I will admit that this *can* be a good thing occasionally I hear a song I really like by a band that in general I do not).

1352833847.0	134wms	Ever had some odd reactions to expressing your love of country music? 	ARoadNotTaken	13	1	24	"To do a little prefacing, I'm from a little country called Malaysia, and when I came to Canada 12 years ago; I absolutely fell in love with country music and something about it resonated with me. I wake up to it, go through my day with it, and I'll unabashedly admit to listening to it if anyone asks. 

That said, I'm an Asian guy who works in a tech company; and I've recently been tossed back onto the dating circuit. Whenever I happen to mention that I love country music; I get the eye rolls and the ""but you're asian!"" line which makes me cringe. I'm not saying that liking country is what's killing me on my dates (I assure you dear reader that I have many plentiful flaws that I can call upon for that), but it certainly doesn't seem to be helping any. 

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to ask if anyone else felt like they were in a similar boat. I'm wondering if other genres seem to carry the same stigma's ""Oh you listen to classical music; clearly you're from the 19th century!"" or ""Oh you listen to rap; clearly you're a gangster with poor credit!"" or ""Oh you listen to bag pipes, clearly your parents fornicate with sheep""

Just saying :P

I really love fiddle and harmonica and steel guitar, but those are becoming more and more rare.


These are my favorite new-ish artist that I listen to on a regular basis:

Turnpike Troubadours

Stoney LaRue

Kyle Park

Randy Rogers Band

Josh Abbott Band

Jamey Johnson

Wade Bowen

Eli Young Band



To give you a feel of what I REALLY enjoy, here are a few songs:

[Turnpike Troubadours - 1968](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RelbbYG7H8A)

[Randy Rogers Band - Missing You Is More Than I Can Do (live, best i could find)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX8Az6wCaIA)

[Stoney LaRue - Solid Gone (live)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDxgjzoJalQ)

[Kyle Park - Leaving Stephenville](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxkKSGFWaJ8)

[Josh Abbott Band - Her Eyes Turn Green](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BFAT7gsLl8)



Can anyone recommend artists with sounds similar to these? Aside from these listed, I really like the typical classics such as Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams (Sr.), George Strait, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, etc., but I'm really looking for fiddle and steel guitar-centered acts.

I recently heard Luke Bryan's ""I Don't Want This Night To End"" and it got me in the mood to look for similar music. The only other songs I have in my collection are Amazed by Lone Star and Whiskey Lullaby by Brad Paisley. I don't know if I'm supposed to, but I also like that Before He Cheats song. Haha.

I was wondering if anyone wouldn't mind trying to point me to some songs along those lines. By ""those lines"" I mean songs that are a bit more of the love/serious sing-along type than the get-up-and-dance type or the happy-fun type. I hope that makes sense.

Thanks for any suggestions you guys have.

I'm fairly sure the title was ""it's a dogs life"" or ""a dogs life"" and the basic premise of song is the bond between a boy and his dog as the boy grows up and eventually moves out of the house and onto college.  The hook of the song is ""it's a dogs life"" and theres lots lyrics about taking a ride in a car/truck down to get an ice cream cone.

I know this isn't much info, but i have searched all over the internet for that specific song, just can't find it.

I'd be glad if anyone could help me on a journey down memory lane.

Ps. It's not Lionell Cartwright or Cat Stevens"	t5_2qnqv	True

He sang all his greats, plus: White Lightning, Dixieland Delight, Whiskey Bent and Hell bound, and Give it away. I must say for as big of an Alabama fan as I am, Jamey may have put them to shame singing Dixieland Delight. 

I was a little concerned that night before the show because I have a few friends that saw him in Myrtle Beach the night before. They said he played three songs, spilled his drink and left. Can anyone else confirm this?

Anyway, it was great seeing one of the last of the ""greats"" play again. "	t5_2qnqv	True

It's about a guy who goes into a pawn shop and picks up a guitar. He names it a woman's name and talks about how he takes it everywhere with him, and ends up pawning it again. It was a pretty big hit on the radio stations out there, however I can't really remember the lyrics to do a google search.

I know this is kind of vague, but it's been killing me for the past few hours. Any help is appreciated!

I have vague memories, like snapshots, from when I was little but that's about it. I remember him on Christmas sitting with my mother in front of the fireplace and everything feeling so right. I must have been about 2 then, in a year he would be gone. According to my mother he was a pretty nasty alcoholic, but he refused to admit that alcohol was a problem, even though it ended up costing him his job. I think that was when he just said ""fuck it"", packed up and headed down the road.

Growing up my mom and I moved around a lot, her waitressing at one truckstop and then another after my new ""uncle"" gave her a black eye. I tried to fit in with the kids wherever we went, but I always got picked on no matter what. I would take it at first, but then one day Tommy Wilson was poking me in the chest and I just saw red. They said he was breathing out of a tube for a week and I didn't get charged because I was a minor. After that most of the guys left me alone, but I was still kind of awkward around girls, a least I could always make them giggle.

When I was 17 I decided that I had had enough of schooling and my many ""uncles"" and I drove out of town in a truck I had saved up to buy by mopping floors and wiping counters at the diner. When I was done driving for the day and had pulled off to the side of the road to get some rest I would often stare at a picture of my father. My mom had given it to me before I left, couldn't figure out why she decided that then was the time to give me some ratty picture of my old man, but she seemed to think it was. I would look at his face and try to see my self and wonder how much of him was in me.

I was just finishing a long stretch of highway one night when I pulled into a little town somewhere's in Tennessee. I thought I would wet my throat a little bit after the dusty air had dried it out and maybe try my luck with one of the farmers' daughters around those parts so I stepped through some swinging doors into a dirty bar to get a drink. My boot hit the floor and kicked up some dust. There were pretty girls, there was liquor, and there was a card game going on in the corner. I couldn't see any of this. The hair stood up on the back of my neck as I recognized him, that man from the photograph, sitting right in front of me at the bar. I clenched my fist and shouted ""My name is Sue, how do you do?

I wanted to make a Spotify playlist of country songs that talk about gender issues, racial equality, LGBT issues, social justice, etc. to see how many I can name, and maybe to try and convince some of my more liberal friends that it's not all guns and God in every song. Some people aren't in to country because they think it's too conservative or it doesn't have a good message. I say that's crap, but some people need more convincing.

My very short playlist so far:

""Welcome to the Future,"" Brad Paisley (was considering ""American Saturday Night"" and I guess I should throw ""Accidental Racist"" on there)
""All Kinds of Kinds,"" Miranda Lambert (was considering ""Heart Like Mine"")
""We Shall Be Free"" (of course, this is a perfect one but I had to do a tribute band version)

Any help would be appreciated. I'll do more thinking while I am at work. Thank and be well, friends!!"	t5_2qnqv	True

Well, the title explains it all really. Over on The Voice UK we had a singer who sang a few country songs that I really digged, and it made me want to look a little more closely at this genre.

At this point, I really am an open book. I've listened to some of the more 'now' stuff- a few songs by Brad Paisley, a couple of Tim McGraw's etc (oh, and that cover Taylor Swift did of George Strait's 'Run') but other than that, I'm completely open to suggestion.

On The Voice, the songs that grabbed me were Landslide, Don't Close Your Eyes and Just To See You Smile.

If anyone could give me some recommended artists, albums and songs, I'd be v grateful. We really don't get much exposure of country here so I have literally no idea where to start...

Thanks!"	t5_2qnqv	True
