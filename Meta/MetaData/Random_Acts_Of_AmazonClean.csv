Amazon.com has apparently changed their shipping rates for certain items (DVDs being one of them).

You can see the info in the fine print [HERE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161252).

DVD/Blu-Ray shipping has gone from $2.99 to $3.99. I personally see this as a **huge** reason to join [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime). I personally had been questioning whether renewing was worth it... Well that answers that.

I don't have many answers or details about all of this but thought you all should know.

1361556435.0	1916sm	[PSA] In Regards to Secret Gifting! New Addition to FAQ! Please Read!	Legasia	142	8	241	"Recently we have noticed a major increase in [Gifted] threads where people are blocking out the item and the name of the person being gifted, without mentioning the username being gifted. Many sub members have mentioned concerns with such giftings, for many reasons. Those include past issues with scammers, as well as the giftee not knowing there is a package on the way and may not realize if it never arrives. The mods have decided that from now on we will **NO LONGER ALLOW SECRET [GIFTED] THREADS!**

This change is reflected in the FAQ: ""[Gifted] is used to signify that you have purchased a gift for someone! Be sure to include a link to the screenshot of the confirmation, if possible. We understand that those using mobile devices will not be able to do so. Remember to leave order numbers unedited and to announce the user name of the person you gifted. If your gift is a secret keep it that way! These posts that do not signify somewhere (on the image or the thread title) the user name of the recipient will be removed.""

This is not saying you can no longer be involved in secret gifting. This is just saying we will no longer allow you to post a [Gifted] thread and claim that it is a secret! **The point of a [Gifted] thread is to tell someone that a gift is heading their way.** And posting an almost blacked out image with no username does not accomplish this task.

As an additional reminder, **please be sure that the order number can be seen completely.** A lot of people go a bit overboard scribbling out the name and block some of the order number. This is not ok. If you want to edit out someone's real name, that is allowed. Just be sure to include the username of who is being gifted somewhere; it can be written in on the gifted image itself, or just mentioned in the title of the gifted thread. For those who cannot post a gifted image (mainly mobile users), please remember to include the order number in the text of your gifted post.

One final thing (and then I will shut up, I promise!) **If at any time someone is asking you to send them something (be it PM, in comments, on Skype or IRC), screenshot the messages and send those images to the mods so that we can handle the situation immediately!** I have noticed people mentioning that this is going on, but there is nothing we can do to stop it unless you tell us about it!

Hey party people! Please upvote the hell out of this! I don't get karma for a self post and I just want everyone to have a chance to win!

First of all, wowzer! 250 days of this awesome place! I'm hopped up on Mountain Dew White Out so even though it's 3am in Ohio and I have to get up at 7:45... Here I am!

I have given around 150 gifts here. I tried to count just not in my amazon history because I went nuts a while ago and deleted a ton of my post history on reddit. Oh well. Anyway I gave up because there were like 25 pages of orders and I gift in other subs so it was confusing. 

Sorry I'm rambling. POINT BEING: I like to give presents! 

[Here was my intro post!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/xw82b/intro_just_what_i_was_looking_for/) 

Everyone was so nice to me. I know that's not a ton of comments by today's standards here, but at the time I couldn't believe how many people welcomed me! It was crazy. I was super weirded out and even suspicious of how nice everyone here was. It freaked me out. 

I'm rambling again... Sorry caffeine. 


**Okay so to win, link your intro! And include the word INTRO in your post! And tell me why you love it here!**


*edit one- whatever if you never did an into just write the damn word. I actually don't care, but if you did one post it!!!) and it would be cute to also say how many days you've been here!!*


I don't care how long you've been here. It took my forever to find my damn intro. You can find yours. Get out your scrolling gloves and put the boots to those ""submitted"" pages. 

This place has genuinely changed my life for the better. I've made more amazing friends than I could ever name so I'm not even going to try. I love each and every one of you!

I don't have a crap ton of cash on me, but I'll pick ya something cool from your list. :D

If I remember my credit card when I go to work,  I will pick a winner tomorrow(today actually... I guess even though I haven't slept yet!) around 5pmEST. If I forget my card you'll have another hour or so before I get home. 

Happy birthday RAOA!!!


**edit two**
Aw I love you guys! I just woke up to a really awesome response to this! And there are so many more hours left in the day! I want to gift all of you!


*edit 4* THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE WINNERS


**edit 5** I'm drunk with power so here's a 5th edit.  I'm at work and I love you guys and I'm going to try to reply to some of you eventually. I love the positivity here today! Let's keep it rolling throughout this whole day! I promise to read every comment!!!  

*edit 6* I've never had so many contest entries!!! This is pretty baller. Yeah I just said that. Get over it. I might start randomly gifting people from the thread here shortly. Who knows. Why not?

**edit 7** shut up I do what I want.

1360292505.0	183x0q	"[PSA] The rumor of our demise into ""power hungry"" beasts has been greatly exaggerated."	VKilledTInternet	124	11	509	"So the rumor mill has been running rampant around these parts. lolinternetdrama amirite?

Well I'm doing this PSA to clear the air of what REALLY happened with some recent crap.

Note: Normally we do our job well enough that we do NOT have to divulge this information to other users. 95% of the time we remove things/message people about it and it's done. We've just been seeing a lot of malarkey around and decided as a team to come to the community about this current issue.

/u/thedarkestone1had been posting more discussions which could be seen as ""b'awww"" which I've seen as a whole on this sub we're pretty much against and sick of. Did I mention it's in the rules that you shouldn't do that? Well, we asked her not to, a few times.The main concern was that she kept gifting even while she didn't have to money to spend and she made a point to mention with that she was broke but doing it anyway. She also had a thing with coming into ended contests and saying things like ""Darn, I so wanted to win."" 

This kind of behavior was bordering on begging and when you put all of that together, you get our attention. We temp-banned her for a week and fixed the problem. Her ban was up today and we'd like to Welcome her back :)

/u/Blissfully however, is another story. I'll just link what I sent another user about it in a PM from the modmail.


Alright to get back to your question:

&gt;Her post was fine except for the part specifying that she wanted ""Pictures, links &amp; throwaways are welcomed."" This behavior encourages others to post items that would be seen by others as ""whoring""

&gt;For example ""Check out my tits in these lingere, I'll try on any lingere from my list if you buy it for me teehee silly boys""

&gt;That kind of comment in this case didn't happen (Thank god) but the line is what got the post removed.

&gt;That's all. Removed.

&gt;Then, in her response to the mods she came off as very rude. We've had other similar responses from her so we tempbanned her for a week. To show that we didn't appreciate the tone of her messages. That's why she was banned.

Apparently this one stormed off in a huff and used another user to dodge the ban. We're debating on further action to take on this one. 

So a small reminder of rules 

* We are a ""Family Sub"" because we do NOT have a limit on under 18 folks. If this becomes an issue later it will be addressed.

* NSFW stuff is perfectly fine. Just as long as it's not photographs/videos of YOU and/or subtle begging to go along with it. .gifs, stories, videos are fine, as long as they're labeled with that lovely NSFW tag. Report a thread that should be NSFW please.

* tl;dr: when the mods ask you to stop doing something, stop it. get pissy, get banned""

And some personal suggestions from me about this whole ""cliquish"" shit.

* If you see someone gifted ""too much"" you're doing it wrong. It's not about comparing the amount of trash you produce via amazon packaging to the next person on this sub. We're not forcing people to get gifted. 

* Don't like what someone is posting? Think they are doing it to get gifted? Don't gift them. Simple as that

* If you're feeling that the ""same few people"" are being gifted, it's probably because they're active members of the community and they've made friends here too. Now I understand coming into a group can be intimidating, but I've tried to give you all the tools to make it super easy to get involved in the sub. Make a friend! We're all friends that you just don't know yet :)

1372517943.0	1hb8yu	[Thanks] Kalanz. There are not enough thanks in the universe to express my gratitude. I am shocked and awed. I'll try a more eloquent thanks once my capacity for coherent thought returns. You, sir, are amazing.	BuffHagen	130	19	46		t5_2tx47	False
1369742092.0	1f703o	[Contest] For everyone. A contest to put RAOA back on track	CampBenCh	122	13	679	"Disclaimer- this is all from my phone so sorry for things like typos and formatting. 


Sorry for a short rant/intro to this contest 

Here's the deal. I LOVED the secrets thread (and even the secret crush one), but something really struck a nerve with me and made me sad. So many people feeling left out or ignored on here. I am shy IRL and to me I don't understand how you can still be shy on the Internet. But I know that's me, and everyone is different. Thus I am making this contest. 

Here's the problem: people feel ignored, no one cares, no one listens, everyone else has friends on here, there's ""cliques"", etc. 

Solution- bring people together. 

But how? By having a contest. Some people are motivated by gifts so this will help. For this who ""don't want to be gifted"" STFU for this contest. This sub was founded on gifting so ill gift you if you win dammit! This sub is now about community, so lets fix that now. 

So what is the contest? Lets go over it now (pull up a chair). 

We are all now going to meet new people. I want EVERYONE who reads this to participate. Even you mods. 

You might be saying, ""But CampBenCh, how are you going to make me meet people?""

Glad you asked. Here's what to do: go to the random wish list button and hit it once. If you have NEVER spoken or interacted with this user, copy the username and find them on reddit. If you have ever spoken to them before roll again until you find someone you have no idea who they are. 

Next, send them a PM to learn more about them. BE NICE! To properly enter you need to screen shot your message so I know you don't lie. **if you don't know how to do this, ask in here and someone will help!** Some topics can include- how old are you? Where do you live? What sports do you like? Pets? Kids? SO? Favorite book/food/movie/music? Or anything else that let's you get to know this person. **You need to ask more than one question! You need to get to know them!** 

Once you have your screenshot, post it in the comment section here. After conversing with your new friend, give them a link to your comment on here. **EVERY USER MUST COMMENT TO VERIFY THEY TALKED AND HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO THEM BEFORE!** this is important so people don't cheat/lie. 

That's it. Simply get to know someone you've never talked to before on here and you may win! You can enter up to 5 times!! Of course you can do this more than 5 time but only 5 will count as an entry. 

Contest will end in two nights since I should still be on casing break and I can have time to try and gift. Ill say ~~Thursday~~ WEDNESDAY/Thursday night at ~~8pm-ish~~ 2am Central time (I had to change to make sure I can gift then. It will be THURSDAY at 2am (my Wednesday overnight shift if that makes sense).). 

I saved this for last in hopes anyone looking for an easy contest to just get gifts are scared away. There will be three winners. Prize 1 will be random. This winner will get something $50-100 off their wish list. You cannot tell me what you want- you shouldn't enter to win a gift, you should enter to make this sub a better place! Prize 2 goes to the person I feel did the best job (made a real connection, help sorted out a problem, had the best questions to ask etc). This winner will get something for $25-35 off their wish list. The last winner will be gifted Reddit Gold. I haven't thought of anything cool to judge on, so ill just do it random. 

So, you only need to screen capture your sent message questions to a user and get them to reply to your comment here that you two conversed (just say something so I know there wasn't lying). Again, you can do this up to 5 times. All my randoms will be by numbering the posts (sorted by old) and random generating a number. 

I hope to see a lot of entrants and a lot of new friends! So go out there and do it. "	t5_2tx47	True

My husband was off work and gave me 40 bucks (20 more than the usual 20) to go play bingo. I usually go once or twice a month because it's my guilty pleasure. I get three hours out of the house AND I get to socialize with some pretty snarky old black women. Who could ask for more? So, I go and buy my boards. I spent about 15.00 on bingo boards, bought a taco salad (which was 5.00), and saved the rest. I actually posted my iPad contest during intermission. I didn't win anything playing Bingo, but decided to go try my luck on the video bingo machines. Long story short, I turned 20 bucks into 1,025.00. Everyone was astonished- said they'd never see anyone hit the jackpot. I couldn't believe it. That's almost exactly how much I've given on Reddit over the past 6 weeks. For those who don't believe in karma, believe it! 

  *Also, this means that whether or not I get the job, I'll still be giving away the iPad. Woo!*

We are allowing group gifting from now on.

**Two ways to do a group gift**

1. Sending all the funds directly to the giftee.
2. Collect all the funds on one account and purchase the agreed upon gift.

**Please note a few things regarding this change.**

1. Practicing safe group gifting 
 * A smart way to collect money is via paypal or gift cards. Note: If you do paypal someone has to withdraw the money into their bank account to pay. Paypal doesn't work with amazon.
 * Message the mods with the plans of the gift.
 * Report any sketchy behavior immediately.
 * If you are the collector, be sure document every step of the process in case you are accused of scamming.

2. Stipulations
 * Do not post asking for donations/participation. This is considered begging.
 * Do not go around sending unsolicited pms for donations/participation. This is also considered begging. 
 * Although the mods will ban any user abusing group gifting, they will not be able to return your money.
 * Take caution as this is all at your OWN risk.

3. Important factors if risky factors are involved
 * If you are caught not purchasing the gift agreed upon by your contributors, you will be banned.
 * If you are caught collecting extra money for a gift and not returning it to the one who gave it to you, you will be banned.

Once again I will note, if you notice **anything sketchy at all** please message the mods immediately."	t5_2tx47	True

You can find it [here!](http://n8fq.org/wishlistquery2.php) Or in the sidebar.

**How to use it**

* Username: If you're looking for a specific user, enter their Reddit username here. Leave it blank to search everyone's lists.
* Keywords: Enter something you want to search for. If, say, you want to find Doctor Who-related items, enter ""doctor who"". Note that it's pretty primitive at the moment, you can't enter a list of words and find items that match all or any of them, just a single phrase to match.
* Price: Enter a minimum and maximum price range. Note that this is ALWAYS in US Dollars - it converts UK/CA/DE/etc prices to USD. The default minimum is 16 cents - that filters out out-of-stock items (which show up as $0.00) and Amazon gift cards (which show up as $0.15).
* Include users active in last *x* days: Restricts the search to users who have posted on RAoA in the time you specify.
* Include only lists with a shipping address: Skips lists that can't be gifted to because the user didn't enter their shipping address.
* Include only users who have gifted: Selects only users who have posted at least one [Gifted] thread on RAoA.
* Include NSFW lists: Shows results from lists with ""NSFW"" in the title, which are otherwise skipped.

Items on the to-do list include ~~improving the list of users who have gifted (this uses the same data as the feature I added to the RWG a few days ago, which has been found to be incomplete)~~fixed! and ~~adding checkboxes to include or exclude amazon.com/co.uk/ca/de/etc lists.~~done!"	t5_2tx47	True

All you have to do is write me **one** 10,000 word story. Well-written, insightful, enjoyable to read. I know you guys have it in you. It can be about anything you like, but you must not have started it before today. It must be EXACTLY ten thousand words. Including a title, which is mandatory. **Any more or less than ten thousand words including all titles and your entry is disqualified.**

End date is May 1, 12am CST.

HAPPY 10,000 MOTHERFUCKERS &lt;3

After /u/georgedouglasmcfly talked me out of jumping off of a bridge, I ate a cheesy gordita crunch and I'm going to try again.

SO... it was one week ago today that you guys helped me celebrate my first week of sobriety by giving me an overwhelming outpour of support... and gifts... and PMs and comments. And I almost couldn't handle the gift train. Eventually, I realized it wasn't coming to run me over, it was there to pick me up. :)

Those who gifted me... thank you so so so much from the bottom of my heart. I don't have all of the items yet, but I couldn't wait. Things not arrived yet will be posted later. But thank you in no particular order to:

skinghtx, prisaneify, -captain-, wintersleep13, willow01, sassy_lion, sumpinlikedat, lesbianforemmawatson, candroth, stellamaroo, tandem7, showurnuts, chrisgarrett, georgedouglasmcfly, peganpirate, ebooksgirl, sp3cialk13, orejo, purplescorpion, 186394, shorinbb, jesusrollerblading, biocarbonates, white_tiger, alloftimeandspace, micha85, damnyoureloud and MeghanAM. 

I hope I haven't missed anyone!! Also, I'm sorry I had to change underscores to dashes for captain because reddit was formatting it weird!!

Thank you also soooo much for the PMs of support from:


strid215, tandem7 (who also emailed me books!), resiaD, ilikesleep, aka_dev, charlyxxx, sir_peanut_butter, alloftimeandspace, mostawesomechic and micha85!

Okay, so on to the goods, I'm so sorry I am at work and I don't have time to look up and attach names to all of the gifts that I'm aware of who sent. Feel free to claim them in the comments as a lot I didn't know who sent anyhow!

Also YES I took down my flair right now! Sheesh. I don't need anything else!!! Thank you guys all so much. I'm here, I'm 2 full weeks without a drop of alcohol. They haven't all been awesome, but you have all supported me the whole way. For a long time I thought GemCityTiffany had to be this perfect person for you guys, but Tiffany was not perfect. I didn't want to show you guys my problems because I thought I had an image to uphold.

We want to make your dreams come true!

Here's the deal:

We want to gift two items.

**RULES:**

**Gift One** - No price limit, but be reasonable. We aren't made of money.

Tell us what you want/need. Include a link to it on your WL.

**Gift Two** - Something $20 or under. For this, we will use Reddit Raffle. The phrase will be **""C'mon...gimme.""** Link us to what you want if you have a specific gift in mind!

*EDIT* You do NOT have to enter into both parts of the contest. If you want only one of the gifts, that's fine! Just specify which one you are entering for :)

Oh, and tell us how nice we look today.

Contest will end sometime **tomorrow (Saturday, June 15) at around 7 PM EDT.**

Go! :)

MeghanAM	93	13	116	"In an effort to make the sub significantly more user-friendly, we have separated ""FAQs"" from ""rules"" and created two separate documents.  The purpose of an FAQ is to address questions that a new user may have. The format of an FAQ was not a good way to present the rules of the sub, and was definitely a bit overwhelming for new users!

The new FAQ is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/wiki/faq) (and on the sidebar), and if you have any additional suggestions for questions that we should address there, we'd love to hear them.

The new rules document is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/wiki/rules) (and on the sidebar).  Please review these rules.  Though we have not added new rules, we have clarified and expanded the existing rules, and there are some that you may not have seen in the old faq due to formatting (sometimes rules weren't where you'd expect them to be listed, causing people to miss them).

These documents do get regularly minorly updated (typically, to add more examples under a rule, or to add clarifying ""THIS is ok but THIS isn't"" text), so should be periodically reviewed.  When we majorly update a section or add new rules, we make a PSA to advise the community.

And a big specific thank you to /u/Sp3cia1K, who did the lion's share of this reorganization and work.

To contact the moderators, please [use modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Amazon), which you can always find at the bottom of our sidebar! This way you get all of the mods together instead of PMing any one of us."	t5_2tx47	True

I got it, I made [a video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1g9lpi/thanks_to_64_of_you_i_got_a_kindle/), and it was great, but after using it a few times I realized that the Kindle Fire was a little too fancy for a simple person like me. Today I got a Kindle Paperwhite, and I found it much more to my liking.

So, instead of returning it, I'm giving the Kindle Fire away to one of you.

It's the Kindle Fire HD 7"" without the annoying 'special offers'.

(And yes, I'm stealing /u/YourLoverGirl's contest idea almost exactly.) 

If you want to enter, tell me why you want the Kindle and link an ebook you want. If you win, I'll send you the Kindle and buy you the book. You'll have to be comfortable giving me your address. (Don't worry, I'll forget it almost immediately. My memory is terrible. I have to write my username down on my hand.)

That's it. 

I'll pick someone in a couple days.

Can you believe tomorrow will be my **2 month** anniversary at RAoA?! Insane. And in those 2 short months, I've gifted **174 times**. Good thing I didn't go into my bank account to see how much money that is!! ;) On top of the gifts, I've made some amazing friends. This sub always brings me such joy.

So I figured since a kind of epic number of gifting and my anniversary would fall on the same day - why not gift someone something amazing? Something they'd use, and have been pining after for awhile?

Rules are simple:

* Put [the $69 Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366305954&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=kindle) on your WL if it already isn't. Sorry everyone - I can't afford to gift a Kindle Fire! :/

* Tell me why you'd love to have one.

* Use the word **Kindle** somewhere in your post so I can use Reddit Raffle.

That's it! Simple. I want to pay it forward and give someone something amazing that I was also previously gifted &lt;3 Now go!

1371257974.0	1gdidq	[PSA] Regarding Discussion and Savings Posts	re_mix	90	8	85	"After reviewing all of the feedback that has been given so far, we believe to have come up with a few regulations.

**In regards to discussion threads in general**

When making a discussion thread please search to make sure that another one on the same subject hasn't been posted within the past **24 hours**. If we notice a thread has been posted within that time with the same subject, we will remove and let the OP know why.

Although we do understand the sub's topics do move rather quickly, this is to help cut back on the same topic being posted 4 or 5 times a day. We will reevaluate the rule if need be but we think this is what most people had asked for in the review.

**In regards to savings threads specifically**

* **Discussions**: When posting a thread or in a thread there is a difference between ""I have been saving for ####"" and ""I have a gift card fund for ####"". The former is the one that is okay to use. However any posts regarding ""gift card funds"" will be removed because of Rule #1.

* **Thanks**: When posting a thanks thread when receiving a gift card, do **not** post the total you have left. This has made users feel obligated to help contribute and is not what RAOA is about. **Edit**: An alternative idea would be to put how much you have left in the comments on your wishlist. This way you can keep everyone updated.

These few rules will hopefully enhance everyone's experience here at RAOA. Thank you for the feedback in the previous thread as it has opened our eyes to a few issues many of you were having. If there are any questions regarding these rules, please ask here so we can help with them."	t5_2tx47	True

[SHOWURNUTS WISHLIST LINK](http://amzn.com/w/259133Y32GWN1)

**Rules:**

Your job is to search their public lists for the most appropriate item to gift this winner and check to see if the item has already been posted as a top level comment. If not, post away! If your item that you wish to nominate has been nominated previously, *upvote the comment*.

You are to pick something that is below or equal to the tier's price. If the winning item is below the tier price, we will use eligible items to fill the gap by this same system, so please feel free to pitch some small items on here as well!

The winner may vote on their own prizes and provide feedback on the proposed gifts, but the most upvoted gift will win. A vote is a vote, so if you took the time to downvote - it will just be considered an upvote.  Either up vote or don't vote.

1370119764.0	1fhd7s	[Activity] This is the storm. SIGN UP FOR RANDOM ACTS OF AMAZON'S SUMMER CAMP 2013 IN THIS THREAD HERE!	VKilledTInternet	90	11	160	"As Memorial Day has passed, the official start of Summer is upon us. Summer time means fun in the sun (Til her Daddy took the T-Bird away :/) and relaxation, right? 

*Walking along one day you see a [flyer](http://imgur.com/9i1gHzY). It states that Random_Acts_of_Amazon is putting on a Summer Camp for “Lost Amazonians who wish to have fun, forever. Make new friends, compete in competitions and become the Grand Champions of RAOA!*

*Immediately you rush home and pack your things. Bug spray? Check. Water Canteen? Check. That tent from when you went on your lone camping trip where it rained the entire time? Check. You pile everything into the back of your car and eventually throw the Kayak on too. Your friends are going to be there, there’s only a trip down the super information highway. You speed on down the road in search of this wonderful summer haven.* 

*As you make the final turn into the Campground, you pass a sign overhead. It says...*

**Welcome to the official RAoA Summer Camp!**

*As you drive up to the campgrounds, A Counselor greets you at the front gate.”*

**Counselor:** “So this is ____? Well, Welcome to Camp RAOA. Sign ups are over there, here’s a welcome Brochure.”**

*You open the brochure to find a large map of the grounds and find a few familiar landmarks. There’s the BGO Bulge, The Movie Hut, the TinyChat room, The TurnTable Terrace, The Gaming Arena, The Wabble/Webopoly Pavillion, and of course Cards Against Humanity Plaza. Besides the normal beaches, and other various natural landmarks there are 4 distinct camp areas, spread to the winds. These camps don’t have names oddly. Only Numbers. 1-4. You flip over the brochure to the “Introduction” page. Here’s what it says.*

***

**WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL SUMMER CAMP OF RAOA!**

Hello! Welcome! You need an address on your li... Wait, wrong intro. Good day to you sir/madam/friend! Thank you for choosing to attend the official RAOA Summer Camp. The first thing you should do is read this in it’s entirety so that you may find out what this whole “activity” is all about.

* **INTRO**

This is a ""Hogwarts House Cup"" style challenge that will pit you against other RAoAers. The goal is to earn as many points as you can for your team by participating in official activities. There will be challenges each day/week. Also other achievements you will be able to earn throughout the entire competition!

SIGN UP using this survey [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/192KET_ajhFpJYs1BTEKfm-f-suM3y06NNoJ-wVz5FZ8/viewform). Your username will be pumped through our top-secret camp selecting formula, and you will be placed on 1 of 4 camps. Trust us, it’s better than some mind-reading enchanted cap. 
Once you’ve signed up, you will be placed on a Team. Team Rosters will be announced on Day 2 and the admission is ROLLING. Registration does not close, but you will be added to the teams evenly. 

* **How this works**

Once you are assigned to a team, cool things everyday will be posted to the Bulletin Board. Keep your eye on Counselor’s VKTI’s “Submitted Feed” as he will be posting the Daily Events and Weekly Reminders :) Each week, results will be posted.  You earn points by participating in the community’s events! If you do really well, you’ll garner even more points and don’t think because the lights are off the stage you’re not being watched. Official Referees will be paying attention to people as they are allowed to give away points to opposing teams when they catch you Randomly Being Awesome :). Also you have a chance to nominate some Random Acts of Awesome

On June 30th, there will be an Awards Ceremony. The Winner of the Official RAOA Summer Camp Cup will be crowned. The winners will be awarded with the bragging rights of being the Summer Cup Champions for the entire year! 

We are taking Volunteers for the Referee positions. You will be a neutral party in this war between camps. Your service will be recognized alongside the champions, but you will not contribute to one house. For more information, you can check the option on the Survey. 

*As you get to the end of the brochure you realize you’re standing in front of the Selecting Cabin. Where will you end up? Come find out!*

**[GET SIGNED UP FOR THE OFFICIAL RAOA SUMMER CAMP 2013.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/192KET_ajhFpJYs1BTEKfm-f-suM3y06NNoJ-wVz5FZ8/viewform)**

Also: If you’re heading to a MEETUP this year, this is the official month to sign up for those.  There are a lot of the group deal benefits ending sometime around mid-late June and if you were planning on going and taking advantage of that. you should sign up NOW!

**TL;DR RAOA is putting on a ""camp"" which is basically a large competition. You win by having the most points on your team, which are gained by participating in events. You can be a ref or a player. A ref keeps track of the points and can award bonus points to extra awesome people. Sign up and win the title!**

My son and I will draw the winner out of a hat, so make sure you let us know what you loved as a child to get entered in to win!

I really tried to gift everyone that has ever gifted me.. But I'm tight on money and I can't work at all. I finally got my shitty tax return and wanted to give something back. I hope you all enjoy your items and I loves you all &lt;3

A bit about the people I gifted..

Kaemii - You know why I gifted you. I swear you mean more than anything to me at this point and I can't wait to come see you. &lt;3

Acefredfred - Because you gifted me with both laughter and a laser pointer. I love you man. &lt;3

Kalanz - You gifted me a kindle and made me cry on cam with errbody laughing. You truly deserve so much for being so generous. I wish I could gift you more but I really can't and I hate that. Thanks for being awesome and your generosity will never go unnoticed on here. &lt;3 you man. 

MacyBelle - You gave me the experience of trying some fucking-amazing japanese candy and it was SOOOO GOOD! I value our friendship very much and I wish you the best in Hawaii. Thanks for being a great person to me and everyone else on the sub. &lt;3

Glitterpewbz - Ah..the southern sensation. You're pretty fantastic and I feel like we don't get to talk much anymore. You're usually on tinychat but always busy with the baby, as you should be, but I don't really get to converse with ya much. &lt;3 you

BlackDeath87 - You're a pretty fantastic dude. I'm glad I met you and I appreciate the guidance on the philosophical studies. I've been checking it out a bit.. especially now that I have a kindle. Definitely going to read more now. Thanks for being great to us all, &lt;3 you dude. 

CowardlyLobster - I appreciate you gifting me on my birthday. I don't get to see much of you on here, but I do appreciate you being around. Thanks for being great &lt;3

Thisisbeethoven - Mah_Nigga.jpg, you have been nothing but great to me and other RAOA peeps. I appreciate our discussions because you're a pretty interesting guy and it seems that we have similar career paths in the future. Wish you around more and I hope to see you around soon. ""I respect you, bro""

JimCarreysCorpse - MY HOBRO! You know what's up and I thank you for that. I can't thank you enough for the sloth plush. I seriously sleep with that mofo every night. Thanks for being gangster as fuck, &lt;3 you hobro. 

I also gifted someone else an MP3 but I totally forgot to make a note of the name. So I hope who ever you are, enjoy your mp3. =]

There's a bunch of other people I wish I could have gifted.. Specifically everyone that has been nice to me, talked to me, gifted me, made me laugh, or just been there to help out. I appreciate everything you have done on this sub guys and I can't wait to start working again so I can begin gifting every week. 

Thanks for reading the wall of text. Love you all &lt;3

Self-gifted threads are not permitted. This means you cannot post a [Gifted] thread for yourself. Along those same lines, you cannot post a [Gifted] thread for someone who is not a part of RAoA (or for a gift being sent outside of RAoA, such as RedditGifts).

The reason for this is because a [Gifted] thread is meant to tell the person you gifted that a surprise is headed their way. That is its purpose. So posting one for yourself makes no sense (as does posting one for someone not in the community). It just doesn't belong.

Now, if you just bought yourself something *really* cool and want advice on using it or accessories for it or to find out if anyone else has treated themself lately, that's fine. But make it a [Discussion] post instead! :D

In closing, we are NOT saying that you shouldn't treat yourselves! Everyone should get themselves something once in a while. We are just saying that it doesn't get a [Gifted] tag, k? :)"	t5_2tx47	True

3.) After the winners are chosen, there will be a thread opened up in which we find something on their wishlist to gift them! The Community decides! Nominate, most upvoted item works (This step is up for debate however this is how we're going to try it this time if another better idea doesn't present itself, if you have a better suggestion, please comment below!)

4.) The tiers for gifting will be announced within 1-3 days of the drawing. When we have a better idea of how much money we get to play with :)

5.) $1 = 1 Entry ~~**MAX 50 ENTRIES**~~ EDIT: There is now no maximum.

6.) The tier selection is from **BOTTOM TO TOP** and **YOU ONLY WIN ONCE** The lowest tiers will be gifted first to balance the disparities between the donations as we do not want to discriminate against the people who are only donate a limited amount.

                                  //~~~~ **HOW TO ENTER** ~~~~\\

**THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE POTS. ONE FOR .CO.UK ONE FOR .COM**

* This is because the .co.uk Gift Balance and the .com Gift Balance do not carry over. This is how amazon has it set up, we cannot do anything about it


1.) Send the Amazon Gift Cards via email to randomactsofamazon@gmail.com Please include your User Name in the ""To:"" field!

2.) [Do this Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ek_AmCSWTPk5in2kwE68yPENSA7By6tnt-v25N5IW8Y/viewform)

3.) Once your entries have been recorded and added to the pot, we will confirm your entry and you are all set. You may donate multiple times to the  pot over the course of the month.


**THIS IS DONE AS A THANK YOU FOR BEING AN AWESOME COMMUNITY. FUCK YEAH 10k OF US. FUCK YEAH ONE YEAR OLD. [GOOD LUCK](http://i.imgur.com/yY28a.gif)** 


       //~~~~ **Questions Asked Below That Need to be Answered here**~~~~\\

**Question: Can you use Amazon Payments Cash? Is there another way to get you a Gift Card?**

* **Answer: No. We need an amazon Gift Card. If you have a code to an amazon GC(Physical or other) then you'll need to prove you have earned/purchased the code. 

***

For those of you with APC: /u/JoJewels92 pointed out something useful**

&gt;  ""Could you withdraw it to a Paypal and then your bank account? That is what I did last time""

I however cannot find the Paypal option. If you can PM me.

***

**Question: Can we have a bomb for us in Canada/Germany/France/Japan etc.?**

* **Answer:  YES. We just need to have 3 or 4 of you guys come forward, at once so that we don't have some lone wolf out there.**

***

**Question: Can I enter both bombs and win once from each?**

* **Answer: No. You may enter 1 bomb and win 1 Time.**

1374614899.0	1iwub7	SUPER IMPORTANT [DISCUSSION] ABOUT THE LOS ANGELES MEETUP! Please upvote for visibility	CampBenCh	88	12	22	"The LA meetup is coming up very fast, and unfortunately ilikesleep has some issues to attend to  and thus I will be taking over as the person in charge of the meetup. 

I will be getting into LA on Thursday if anyone was wondering. I will be sending out a PM to everyone soon with my contact info and things of that nature.

------------
THE SCHEDULE:

**Friday:** Night- meet up at a bar or someplace social. I have no idea of the bars around, and the suggestions were Father's Office, Yard House, and BJ's. The responses to the questionnaire were inconclusive. 

**Saturday:** The California Science center opens at 10 A.M., plenty of time for late risers to get up and arrive. We'll be visiting to see the permanent exhibits and see the Space Shuttle Endeavor. http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/PlanningYourVisit/Hours/Hours.php Admission is free, parking is $10, reserve tickets early for Endeavor only for the 11:00 time slot. http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/PlanningYourVisit/Hours/endeavour/endeavour.php After our visit, to the Science Center, we'll head to lunch, location yet to be decided, but we could do anything- IN N OUT was suggested. After lunch, we're headed to the Getty center http://www.getty.edu/visit/ Free admission, parking $15 closes at 9 P.M. depending, on how much time we spend here, we can decide on dinner, night activities, or collapsing. 

**SUNDAY:** Disneyland! If people aren't up for Disneyland we will split up into groups. I will need to know how many people are going to Disneyland... I have connections and can get 3 people (including myself) in for free. If more than 3 people want to go to Disneyland then we will split the cost of tickets between everyone. Please note you need cash to do this. If you wanna write me a check I can do that- just let me know so I can get a bunch of cash. 


-------------

So be on the lookout for a PM about this if you have said you want to go. If you do not get a PM today and want to go, you MUST tell me by midnight tonight or I won't tell you all the cool things going on.

If you are going and **have suggestions** about anything about this, PLEASE let me know! This is my first time going to California so things like what bars are good, places to avoid, etc. aren't known to me. 


------------

**EDIT:** I ~~am sending~~ have sent out PM's ~~right now~~.  If you wanna attend and did not get one you must let me know ASAP.

Also- if you need a ride or can drive people let me know! I should be able to drive 4 people if they need it with the rental car I got. "	t5_2tx47	True

1364915987.0	1bip24	[PSA] A Review of Etiquette &amp; Posting on RAoA	MeghanAM	79	9	153	"Hey guys! Very exciting to see us having passed 10,000 members before our first birthday (which, by the way, is on April 16th! bring your own party hat).  Thank all of you who have put in the effort to make our new members feel at home here.

We would like this opportunity to review with new and old members alike some of the finer points of etiquette on our sub.  It is important to us to maintain a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, and a few issues have cropped up that fall on the wrong side of rule #3 (be excellent to eachother).

1. If a post breaks the rules, please report it and [modmail us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Amazon) (modmail possibly not needed if it's obvious what the problem is, but for good measure, it never hurts).  Please *do not* scold the person or make fun of them, even if they have done something that is a clear breach of our rules.  Some members have started off badly here as a result of misunderstanding what we are about and still gone on to be great, productive members.  

2. If you have a problem with a contest or gifted post (or any post, but it's been more of a problem with these), please bring your concern to the moderators.  It is not appropriate to take up a discussion of what you perceive as a problem on the thread.  An example of where this has been a problem is the ""nomination"" type contests.  These contests are allowed and we encourage everyone to run whatever kind of contest they want to run, as long as it follows the [few contest rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/wiki/faq#wiki_contests) outlined in the FAQ.  If you personally do not like the contest, simply refrain from entering -- there are plenty of other contests around here all the time!

3. Assume good intent from community members.  We all occasionally say something that comes across in a way that we do not mean.  If a person seems to be violating rule 3, please report the post.  If you simply disagree with them, please keep the discussion civil! This is a great point about our community that makes it different from many others -- it is a much friendlier, safer space to voice your opinions.  Help us keep it that way!

Thanks for reading, and let me (or all of us, by [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Amazon)) know if there is anything that you have questions about.

PS: Tell me that you've recently reviewed the FAQs and I will give you some kind of enthusiastic praise! They do undergo small changes on a fairly regular basis, so it is good to periodically skim it again."	t5_2tx47	True

You know how Mondays are.  They're boring and I hate them.  I managed to get all of my work done relatively quickly, and spent the rest of the day derping about on the internet between other, smaller work things that came in.  Well, I tried.  My internet was being ridiculous and I could barely even send an email without it taking forever.  And we're just talking text emails, not even pictures!

So I get home, go and check the mail.  There's a package for me, but it's from my snack exchange with some gents from Germany (lots of chocolate; I am so happy).  There's nothing else interesting in my mailbox or at the apartment office.  So I make my way up to my apartment, intent on taking a nap since my eyes are *still* burning from something my brother had in his house yesterday when I was there for the Super Bowl.

And what the heck is on my porch...there is a [HUGE BOX](http://i.imgur.com/NsyAX6X.jpg) propped up against my door from UPS, which is curious cause I never got a delivery notification from them like I usually do.  What is it, I ask myself, though not out loud since that is slightly crazy.  So I open the door, kick back the cats who think that outside would be a nice place to visit, and pull the box inside.  I grab my trusty scissors to cut away at the tape and...


[HOLY SHIT](http://i.imgur.com/bUPCrmH.jpg?1).  THIS CANNOT BE REAL.  NO FREAKIN' WAY IS THIS REAL.  But as I excited remove the box and cut away at even more tape around the generous styrofoam wrapping...I discover that it IS real.

[Pictures cannot do this thing justice, though I need to take more just...in case it disappears in a puff of smoke tomorrow](http://i.imgur.com/P8zAspW.jpg).  It is absolutely beautiful and perfect and nothing in the world hurts anymore (except my eyes, but oh well).  And the [details in this thing](http://i.imgur.com/7G7nxEB.jpg)...Simple amazing.  It came with a plaque too, but I haven't gotten around to hanging it up yet.  I am currently too busy staring in awe at this thing and wondering how on earth I got so lucky as to receive it.  Mean, it's *Narsil*, the sword that defeated Sauron.  *This kind of thing does not happen to me.*

I am about 99% sure this comes from Kalanz, amazing person that they are, so from the very bottom of my black little heart, I thank you over and over and over again!  I just...I can't even.

Some 700 of you probably have never seen me before, but here's a belated, heartfelt WELCOME to RAoA!  I've been away for a few weeks, dealing with some things--no internet, no laptop, no reddit, no energy, no time, blahblahblah--but starting this weekend, I'll be back!  Anyway, none of that is the point of this post.  The point is...)

**A pervasive, dirty scam has just come to light at RandomActsOfPolish, an Amazon-gifting sister-subreddit, and we should all take note.**  Here's a link to the [breaking news](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12fqi6/announcement_those_of_you_that_polished/) and here's a follow-up link to give you an idea of how [widespread this scam was](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12fz0j/as_requested_here_is_an_official_list_of_those/).

In brief:
----
A redditor by the name SweetBabiRay was highly active in RandomActsOfPolish, participating in contest, discussions, and gift chains.  She gifted people often and was gifted herself quite often (as is likely to happen to active, generous members).  She posted screen-caps for her gifts, some with the confirmation numbers and some without.  

A **few** of those gifts shipped.  **Most of them, however--AND WE'RE TALKING OVER 50 ""GIFTS""--never shipped.**  They were scams.  Many of them were never purchased in the first place--she just used an old screen cap and blacked out the confirmation number and recipient's name (under the guise of protecting privacy).  But once a couple people messaged her, saying that their wishlist doesn't show any gifts having been purchased, she wised up.   She started purchasing the gifts--but then canceled the orders before they shipped.  

Someone on the subreddit said she made off with 100 or more nail polishes, several of them in the 8-15 dollar range.  

So what does that mean for us?
----
Well, it can happen to us, if it hasn't already.  I doubt it has on such a large scale, but it could be in our futures.  We should start thinking about ways to catch a scam like this early on.  To get the brainstorming started, here are my gut ideas:

* I think we should start posting full confirmation numbers AND whatever name is listed as the recipient. Remember, whatever name you have listed in your mail-to address is not and has never been 'private.'  Anyone who looks at your wishlist can see it.  So if you don't want your name to be on there or on this subreddit, and if you don't think your mailman will deliver a package to ""xSquishyLuLu9321"", then consider using your first and middle name or your initials.  It's what I've always used.
* Secondly, let us know when something doesn't ship.  If the order is canceled or late, touch base with the sender and give them a chance to make it right.  **But also message the mods.**  The mods can keep track of cancellations/no-shows without us incorrectly implicating someone publicly.  If the mods notice that a member has had a couple cancellations, then they can take swift action.
* Finally, a word on gift chains.  I friggin love em!  But... that's how this scammer got the most gifts in a short amount of time without really purchasing any for others.  Here's what I propose:  Keep the gift chains but only with the explicit rule that you cannot participate in each chain more than once.  The chain that SweetBabiRay exploited allowed members to comment and gift repeatedly.  So it was all at once that dozens of members realized their gifts weren't showing up on time.  We can't allow scumbags to operate such a large-scale scam here.

Almost everyone at RAoP knows about RAoA.  SweetBabiRay could already be operating among us with a new name.  Keep an eye out for anything suspicious, and get mods involved if an expected gift never shows.

^(TL;DR: Someone at RandomActsOfPolish scammed dozens of people out of gifts and it could happen here!)

SAD UPDATE
----
Well, guys.  Here it is.  We, too, were victims of this scumbag.  RAoP's creator (OkraWimprey) let us know in the comments that SweetBabiRay's other username was **PixiBunny**, which will strike an unhappy chord with many of you.  I guess she posted some tear-jerker about her birthday and her little sister, and was gifted on Random_Acts_of_Amazon by a good many Amazonians, some of which you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/search?q=PIXIBUNNY&amp;restrict_sr=on).  You people did a terrific thing by trying to make the lives of some girl and her sister better.  The same goes for the RAoP-ers who polished her for her pregnancy.  I hope she was telling the truth about these things.  But if not, that's for her to deal with.  If there's one thing we Redditors know all about, it's karma. 

EDIT
----
It has come to light in a few recent comments/threads that PixiBunny's shipping address is in Vicksburg, MS.  However, and I probably don't need to say this, but **it is entirely against our community's beautiful nature to discriminate against an entire city of potential RAoA-ers for the action of one crappy citizen.**  Be excellent to each other!

Okay, before I announce the [Mystery Amount](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/18peq0/contest_remember_the_price_is_right_who_can_get/) and who won, I just have to say... this was so much FUN! I plugged all the guesses into Excel (because I am a nerrrrrrrrrrrd) and the average guess was $112.33. The highest guess belongs to Butterfly_CrimeScene, at $3300. The lowest guess was olithraz at $3.95. That's one heck of a range. 

There were 170 guesses. 31 were under the Mystery Amount, 139 were over. 35 were over $100, 6 were over $500, and 2 optimists were over $1000. 

And now, the big reveal: the Mystery Amount was.... $23.00! 

That means the winner is Nepalm, who guessed [$22.99](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/18peq0/contest_remember_the_price_is_right_who_can_get/c8gv4iu). I've already placed the [order](http://imgur.com/JqaRNGi). Congrats Nepalm!

(And, for the record, you smarties who put down an Amazon gift card with no amount specified... I used the amount that came up by default, which was $50. Nice try though :P )

I can't wait to do my next contest. This was so much fun &lt;3"	t5_2tx47	True

So, Mother's day is usually exceptionally tough for me.  My mother passed away August 20th, 2010.  She was and still is the reason I am who I am.  She inspired me every day of my life.  Her kindness, and sheer willpower to be better than she was every single day left me in awe.  She lived each day trying to make other people's lives better.  Even as she was sick and dying, she refused to let go until she knew that I'd be taken care of.  A week before she died she'd asked me whether I would be okay.  It was after I'd been employed for 6 months at HP.  Not knowing what was coming I reassured her, letting her know that yes, I'd be fine, I'm loving the job and doing great. 

Almost everyone around her was inspired by her spirit and kindness.  I remember that she had just had her second leg amputated and they'd told her it'd be at least 6 months before she would walk again and I thoroughly believe the doctors were just being optimistic at that point, not 3 months later she was at the senior citizen center dancing with a friend.  I really wish I still had the newspaper clipping about that.

She'd constantly take people in when they were down on their luck and try to help them get back on their feet.  A lot of times this resulted in someone taking advantage, but, she never let it change her.

So, this mother's day is my gift to her, because I know she'd rather make other people happy then get anything herself.  I remember her and carry her in my heart every day.  I know she'd wholeheartedly approve.

Below is a list of what I and LadyAccountant were able to gather of mothers on RAoA, if we missed anyone, I'm so sorry, please just chime in if you'd like to be added and I'll try and update the table.  Feel free to pick a mother or two, or three and send off a gift. :)  A special thanks to LadyAccountant for not only assisting in putting together the list, but it was a comment by her that partially inspired this.

1366234603.0	1ck83g	[Contest] For The Men	Matronix	73	4	507	"This contest is for the men of this sub.

I don't have anything profound or amazing to say but figured I would do something for us guys around here. The contest posted yesterday for the Ladies was just amazing. All of y'all are beautiful and I hope y'all know it. I saw so many kind and loving words and pretty faces yesterday. I have seen some of the prettiest smiles, brightest eyes, and loving hearts in this sub. Beauty through and through. 

Now back to the men... Even men have body issues but just aren't talked about as much. I still remember my JCPennys pants as a kid that were size ""Husky."" (Seriously, why do that to kids?!) So today, men let us show the ladies what great men we are. Well okay... the 4 guys in this sub, show the 10,594 women what amazing men we are. 

Actually I do have a motivational video for us... [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUs1o_YRpY)

Edit: moved my pics to a comment to be in line with everyone else. 

You don't have to share any pics but I figured why not. Chime in and say what ever you want about yourself.

^^^^We ^^^^didn't ^^^^even ^^^^have ^^^^a ^^^^name ^^^^for ^^^^you ^^^^guys ^^^^this ^^^^time ^^^^last ^^^^year...

My my what a year it has been. It's **RAOA's 1 Year Birthday** today. I was only recently made aware of this. The worst part about this PSA is that I'm having a hard time trying to come up with the words to explain how I feel...


//~~~~~ **How I feel, A personal note from VKTI** ~~~~~\\

This place is singlehandely the coolest thing I've ever been apart of. I've seen a lot of things happen on this little corner of the interwebs. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for participating, subscribing, lurking, gifting, thanking, Contest-an, etc. etc. here on RAOA. I know a few of you have spun off into other little corners, but I know a lot of you have stuck with us as **One of the largest subreddits, by way of traffic.** 

I'm going to keep this part with a lot of I statements and what not to make sure we have some juicy tidbits that make my modhat a little tighter if you know what I mean. 

Back in early 2011 when I stumbled across this group of lovely chaps and lasses, I was naive about the entire process. Fucked up my wishlist first go. It was hard to remember to put an address on ALL my lists lol. I've watched ~10k of you guys come up and make the same mistakes I have. We've lost a few good people to the move. Heron, Capt. America, others that have slipped through the cracks. those are just the names I remembered. 

4chan was the wild west, the past at this point. Now here on reddit we had a chance to grow. It was so hard to get these cheeky folks over to ""The dark side."" Now look at it. There used to be barely 10 of us that would hang out on skype all day. Now there are 10k of you guys out there using our site and it just warms my cockles. 

The early stages were the hardest. Trying to figure out the rules, trying to handle how to manage this place. It's an interesting experience for myself. I got to learn a lot about managing and put my previous experience to good use. Around the time when I started this sub, I was trying my hardest not to slip into a deep depression from what had happened about 6 months ago that I won't dive into here. Just that I started using reddit after that point. Trading my ass off on Steam using /r/steamgameswap like a boss. Then this sub happened and everything changed. Suddenly I had to become and expert on how to run a sub. How to keep a moderation team together. How to present this all in a cohesive fashion so that others that randomly stumble onto us know what to do right off the bat. Really, all I wanted for us to have the 4chan threads back, but on reddit. Obviously this worked a little differently, but I brought a few people in as moderators that were my friends, that were trustworthy and that I knew had some sort of experience before.

This is the part where I thank my friends on modsquad, and some of us who aren't.

First and foremost to /u/Sir_Peanut_Butter. I love this man like he was a brother to me. We've been around the longest (along with /u/AlienPMK). These two brits are two of my favorite people and their kindness has affected me tremendously. TinyGami as some of you might know, is an amazing woman who's come through a lot and I hope she's reading this right now smiling :) Thanks both of you for what you have done. 

Then there's Vinny and Ash. Both guys from the old days and two of my closest friends. Ash is a former moderator here. He was my #2 guy when we started this and right now I'd like to thank him so much for all of the work he's put in. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't on the sweat of his brow. Vinny is a confidant. He's a sagely man I go to for advice. If you've ever been on the skype chat, you know how deathly funny he can be sometimes. Thanks guys for being mah besties when it mattered.

I'd like to thank /u/re_mix She's mah baby mama. This is my way to pay child support because RAOA is our babeh. &gt;.&gt; &lt;3 She's the one that set up our birthday CSS and without her work, this place wouldn't be pretteh.

/u/DersEvvak is probably one of the most enigmatic men I've ever met in my entire life. The reason he has his name is because one time we egged him on to post with a user name. So he decided that the next post, he'd make a name out of his unique ID tag if memory serves correctly. It *looked* kinda like DersEvvak and so it became. He's the most talented coder I know, coding the Random Wishlist Generator and the 2 time host of the Amazon Bombs. He's a loyal, dependable, honorable man that I'm proud to have on my team, and call my friend. Thank you.

SirRipo and Thornz. Two guys who I need to meet in real life and buy them a case of alcohol each. Thank you guys for sticking with us. (SirRipo a former mod btw)

All of the people mentioned above I knew **before** we started this thing. Now I need to thank my new friends. 

/u/kbunneh. thank you for the time you spent on modsquad. Your busy bee butt was welcomed and it was amazing what you contributed to the fray. Thank you for all you have done.

/u/Legasia The Mod-aholic. This woman could moderate a school of fish and keep it in order with her hands tied behind her back. She is that good at what she does. She was here welcoming everyone on their intros before we even did. Her cool mind, caring heart, and wonderful ideas have kept this place running like clockwork. Thank you, so much.

/u/deimorz This guy built /u/Automoderator and is a god amongst men. He's saved the entire modsquad countless hours of busywork with his bot and it's helped us keep this place neat, orderly, and free of clutter and Penis Pump Spam. Thanks dude. Nice job on becoming Admin.

/u/MeghanAM and /u/Sp3cia1K The two sisters from another mister. While new, they've helped tremendously fill the holes in our frontlines of modding. Meg's been around a long while and I appreciate everything she's done to make sure this subreddit stays on an even keel. Sp3cia1K loves this subreddit as much as I do. Her keen work on the Contest list is amazing and keeps that part of the sub running so amazingly smooth. It's like she takes Venus razors to each hour of the subreddit's posting history and leaves it silky smooth. These women have such amazing personalities and bring such a wonderful energy to this place. &lt;3

/u/BaconBiscuits This little Scot has been kicking arse and taking names on our modsquad for awhile, but before that, sung our praises on redditgifts. I'd like to take this space to thank her specifically for finding us and believing in what we're doing. I'm sure without that traffic from redditgifts, we wouldn't be at 10k subscribers today.

Alright. So now that I've collectively thanked all of the modsquad past and present (and some key influential people who have helped shaped us) I'd like to address the rest of you 10k+ and the 2k+ that are still active here (Next thread I post will get into our statistics and some other cool shit so hold on tight.)

This community hands down has shown me there is hope for us yet. As you're reading this more than likely, yesterday there was a tragedy befallen on Boston. I'd like to reflect on moments like that to remind myself and all of you how lucky we truly are to be here today. I don't believe that we're here out of some random coincidence. You're reading this right now because you're supposed to. This sub was founded on the principle that we are here to bring light to darkness (or at least brighten it up a smidge.) I want you all to share things you love here. Your books, your movies your video games, whatever. I've encountered some people who've told me that this is materialistic. We're just propagating a consumerist society and that there is no real substence here other than the acquisition of goods but let me tell you something pal. That is so far from the truth you might as well be doing the conga with penguins around the exposed tusks of mammoths down on the polar ice caps. This place is designed to complete a process. 

* You pick up a story
* You read the story
* You get something out of the story
* You see how that story applies to the rest of your external surroundings(We come in at this step)
* You **SHARE** the story with others so they too may know what you've learned. 

This process, this cycle repeats itself everyday. We pass down things from person to person, generation to generation. Experiences that should be shared because they are valuable to the human experience. We do not ask for silly things that will bring us shallow pleasure! We only **wish** for an experience that we know of, or heard about and hope to pull something profound from it! That's what it means to be an Amazonian! This is why we don't keep track of numbers. Why we discourage whoring and begging. Why we keep ourselves presentable and not lost in a myriad of shallow, pointless shit that we sift through to get to the point. I'm trying to take life, extract it like olive oil and keep it ""extra virgin."" 

This community has proven to me that this is a possible, tangible goal in our lifetime. That we, as people, may grow independently and share with others this experience.

You have all moved me to strive to be a better person. What you've done is taken a tool of learning and made it viral. Whether it'd be the gifting train from a few days ago, the inspiration to pay someone's lunch ahead of you in line, or to just give someone a song so that they may legally own it and play it on their way to work is stuff that is beautiful in of itself because it is good. 

I promise as long as I'm breathing I will dedicate myself to this place and make sure that we as moderators, friends, people keep it up to a high moral standard and a place of high class. 

TL:DR - Please read what I have written. I've taken the time, but for those who do not have time to read it **I love you all. Thank you, Amazonians for being so beautiful inside and out.**

1361150298.0	18q12a	[PSA] NSFW Wishlist Rules!	Legasia	74	7	57	"Alright, so with the sudden influx of newcomers, most of whom are younger, a few users became worried about the use of NSFW wishlists by those underage. To be clear **underage redditors are not permitted to have a NSFW wishlist**. If someone notices someone underage who does, report it to the mods.

Also, this is a great time to review the rules on having a NSFW wishlist for those of us 18 or older! Everything must be marked as NSFW and the list cannot be list used in your flair! This is to avoid it coming up on the random button! If you have a private NSFW list and it is the **second** list in your flair, that is fine as the first list is the one used in the random button!

**Please review this [new section of the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/wiki/faq#wiki_nsfw_wishlists) regarding NSFW Lists!**

1370444581.0	1fq309	[Contest] THE RAOA REVOLUTION.	chronos42	73	6	352	"Greetings, Amazonians.

/u/chronos42 and /u/pony_hawk would like to draw attention to a plague that is beginning to affect our RAOA community. The infection started somewhere in the vicinity of /r/WTF, and it quickly spread to /r/funny, /r/askreddit, and if we don't act now, us.

**THE DOWNVOTES ARE HERE. THE TIME TO SECEDE IS NOW.**

Yes, dear friends, the solution is to break away.

**We will secede from the unholy conglomerate that is reddit and form our own nation, separate and free.**

As with any new society, we will spend the first few days flailing our arms, innocent and without direction, like a newborn babe. After learning more about structure and conformation, our adolescent period will naturally bring rebellion and lawlessness. Anarchy will be fun for a while, but eventually we will settle down and all agree that in this time of separation from our mother reddit… RAOA needs a leader.  

---

So, the contest.

Now it's time for us to find someone to lead us into the wilderness, to forge the trail for the future of our new nation. We need someone to take the reigns and be the leader! But who will it be? It's time to make your campaign! Here's what to do:

* **Create a name for your party.**

* **Develop a campaign slogan.**

* **Design yourself a campaign poster.**

* **Any other elements that you feel would help your campaign are also welcome.**

Chronos and Pony will be running too. [Our humble poster](http://i.imgur.com/3yNBLPJ.png).

Feel free to include any additional platforms, speeches, or baby-kissing in your post. Your posters can be drawn, doodled, Adobe Illustrated, or Microsoft Painted to your little heart’s content.

**Chronos42 and pony_hawk will each choose their winners on the morning of Monday, June 10th.**

*Note: Since we all come from different backgrounds and different parts of the globe, it would probably be best to disassociate yourself from any real political parties for this contest. Get as creative as you’d like, my friends.*

*Second note: No smear campaigns, YA FILTHY MUD-SLINGERS.*

*Third note: Since it's apparently not obvious, this is NOT AN ACTUAL THING. We are not splitting off of anything. This is an idea simply for the purposes of the contest.*"	t5_2tx47	True

1372165435.0	1h19f7	[Thanks] gosphy55 for sheer amazingness. These words here aren't even enough to show how thankful I am.	Matronix	64	0	80	"Morning... Well at least I think it is morning... I could be dreaming, because that is highly possible. I am going to write this as though I am not dreaming and crazy shit like this does happy in real life. 

* **THANK YOU** So much /u/gospy55 for what you have done. I can't even comprehend this right now. Like really I can't.

* Like honestly... I am at a loss of words right now... so trying...

* We went to bed early last night so I didn't get to see this happen when it did. I woke up this morning (still in bed) to a message on my Facebook from /u/jojewels92 saying [this](http://i.imgur.com/YrCy68u.png). This confused me, as I had no clue what could have been going on in Reddit that I needed to go check out. I know I saw I also had two notifications on my phone about giftcards, but I also got gifted two yesterday and I figured my beta OS was still being wonky and it never cleared those notifications. BUT NO... I wake up to see a post for [this](http://i.imgur.com/31NVvvL.png)... I honestly don't even know what to say... like at all. 

* I think I figured myself out. I think it was the first LEGO Minifig Unboxing video that I did where I said I am emotionless... this is where it sucks. But I think my reaction is a lack of words instead of a massive amount of tears... I am genuinely speechless... and this doesn't happen. If I could pull a ringer in here to cry happy tears for me I certainly would. 

* Conversation with the girl this morning while in bed. 
 * Me: Ris, wake up... look at my phone.
 * Her: WTF?!
 * Me: Am I shaking?
 * Her: No.
 * Me: I feel like I am shaking. Should I be crying right now?
 * Her: I would be.
 * Me: Yeah you are a little crying monster. You would be crying.
 * Her: Do I need to oil my little robot? Are you broken?

* I think I am just trying to wrap my head around this (I know I am rambling and I don't care.)

* Gosphy55 you are amazing and awesome and like all that jazz.... *jazz hands* I can't even explain how I feel right now or how grateful I am to you right now. You didn't need to do this... not one bit. If I could give you a big hug right now I would.... Like big hug, no joke. I'm short, but I will damn sure try to pick you up off the ground while hugging you. Here is the best picture I could do and just imagine me giving you a big hug. (Sidenote: I even put on a shirt this morning just so I could take a picture for you.) [THANK YOU SO MUCH](http://i.imgur.com/Ud2KzgB.jpg)

I feel as though this thanks post isn't even an iota of what it should be or what I want to be saying. I just want to know that what you have done is greatly appreciated and I will remember you always for it. You are just fantastic.

After exploring the depths of AskReddit and feeling bullied by trolls. I found somewhere I could have a discussion without feeling judged, knowing I was safe. At that time in my life, I needed that. It was a community.

I smelled something funny when there started being downvotes. It seemed weird. There was competition. Not much was done about it. I sensed things would go wrong when I heard about gift chains, which I seriously dislike. Then, Amazon Bombs? Even worse. Sure, some were fine. I just had a bad feeling.

Now all of this going on? I feel we are losing our community vibe people? We need to save that! Using our compassion, rather than rules, to be nice to each other. Whether you are recieving, gifting or giving the gift of conversation, we shall hold on to that community, family feeling.

Please don't let me down. I know we can make it through all of this. It could be the beginning of the brilliant new era or the start of hell. I hope everyone makes the right decision.

Call me over dramatic (I am), but I just want to make sure people pay attention so we can make this subreddit even better.

We shall thrive!"	t5_2tx47	True
1344278300.0	xs0y1	[NEWS UPDATE] Hey this thread is kind of important so you might want to read it!	VKilledTInternet	67	6	52	"Hello Amazonians,

Before I get into our MAJOR news announcements I would like to personally THANK every single one of you for subscribing to this subreddit. To see this concept jump to nearly 1500 people is astonishing to me. We were once a group of about a dozen hardcore people and another couple dozen people rotating in and out. Now, it's something I've always hoped for. The continued giving of this community, not for the fact that we * receive* things (All though admittedly it's a really nice feeling to have a package at your door) it's about putting smiles on the faces of the people who are getting the stuff. 

With that being said there are a few things which we, The Mod Team, would like to discuss with all of you.

**1.) Please post an [INTRO] Thread!**

Remember folks, don't lurk in the shadows! (I SEE YOU OVER THERE)

When posting an [INTRO] Thread make sure you follow the FAQ on the sidebar to see how to use this subreddit to the fullest extent. If you don't know how to make a wishlist, we have it's own FAQ as well. Don't forget to tell us about yourself! 

**2.) A [Contest] Thread needs these things!**

* What the Contest requires
* When you're going to gift the winner
* A dollar amount is a nice thing to add, but **not necessary**
* A message to the mods if you don't see it on the sidebar within 4-6 hours of posting.

When you end the contest, please do the following: 

* Edit the OP to announce the winner
* Message the Mods with your winner and link to your contest so that we may remove it from the sidebar.
* PLEASE Make a [Gifted] Thread

**3.) A [Gifted] Thread is awesome! A [Thanks] Thread is equally as awesome!**

When posting a [Gifted] thread, make sure to screencap the yellow box after purchasing an item make sure to eliminate the **Last Name** and **Order Number** from the cap. [Thanks] Threads are not necessary but always a good thing. If you can post a picture of you using the item it's even better! 

**4.)** Now for some ACTUAL News. We're looking for a new Skin for the reddit! If ANYONE knows how to do that PLEASE message the moderators and we'll take suggestions and hold it to a vote if there are more than one option. We are also in talks to get an Auto Mod bot. Where the [TAGS] will be come VERY important. We ask you to please appropriately take the time to tag your post!

**5.)** The Birthday Calendar will be something that we will be keeping up with! When we get a chance, we will be posting WEEKLY BIRTHDAYS on the sidebar so you know who's got a cakeday coming up!

**6.)** There is a tournament coming up hosted by our lovely mod /u/CropCircles! It's playing the game Boardgame Online, and there will be a pool for the winners! Basically some of us will be donating to a pot so that the winners of the Tournament will be gifted handsomely! http://www.boardgame-online.com/ is the link to the place and you should get some practice in! Another news update on specifics will be coming up shortly. (If this goes well, we might be doing a version of this for the Holiday Season) This is in response to the Monthly Raffle idea we had.

**7.)** There shall be **NO STATISTICS GATHERED** on this subreddit. People shall be gifted as they see fit. As this would eliminate the *random* aspect from this subreddit and spiral us into a e-dick measuring contest.


Alright folks! That's it for now, you're all updated! One last thing I must ask of you all/remind you of.

While the name over on your sidebar says I'm the one who created the subreddit, the Mod Team is what is keeping this alive and kicking. I would personally like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to our ideal.

I am looking into rescheduling what was supposed to be the Orlando meetup, since we had to cancel it due to lack of interest/people already having other plans for that weekend.  

I have created an **[initial interest survey] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sndsYLPyNMWxRDf3pxs-iDm_VVitHazH87aT6zVWUog/viewform)** that you should fill out if you are interested in a meetup in the Florida/Georgia area.  We may move the location from Orlando to another location (Jacksonville/Savannah/other) or we may keep it in Orlando, but I need your input!  

Fill out the survey if you even remotely interested and we'll go from there.  Feel free to discuss here ideas for the meetup. Let me know if you would like to help plan!"	t5_2tx47	True

That’s why we decided to conduct a compelling social experiment that proves to women something very important: You are more beautiful than you think.”*

Post a picture or tell me a story! Let RAoA know how beautiful you are.

 

Ending Date: 4/20/2013

  Study break! So, I passed the first part (theoretical questions) of my SEO exam. I'm feeling pretty confident about the 144 question application part now that I know what it's all about. Not to sound too cocky, but I think I've got it in the bag!  

  So, I want to give away the iPad I won for the Super Bowl.

  To enter, tell me why you want an iPad, what you'd do with it, what it would mean to you. I don't want any super sob stories, but I want to make sure it will be appreciated and not resold. If you'd prefer I sell it and gift you 400.00 from your WL, please link what item(s) you'd want and what they'd mean to you. I'll raffle it (with a video) on Valentines Day which is the day I know my exam results. (If by some chance I don't get the position, I'll still gift someone, but it won't be as large.) 

  **Happy Valentines Day, RAoA. I love y'all**

Sir_Peanut_Butter	72	13	140	"There are some great subreddits for helping people with addictions and depression but I thought it would make people more comfortable if they could discuss such a thing in the safe environment of our own community.  
The main focus of this helpline is the aforementioned subjects but I'd be more than happy to talk to you if you're just having a crappy day or you're having problems at work or at home.  
Also, just so you all know, **anything you say to me in private message or on Skype is 100% confidential and will not be repeated to anyone.**  
I want you all to feel as safe as possible!


Any other subscribers that have quit anything before or managed to deal with depression are welcome to join and give people pointers and general support.
I have also made a Skype group for us to come together and discuss how we can better deal with our addictions/depression.  

I look forward to talking to you all and hopefully making progress together. I love you guys :)

1369403341.0	1eyxis	[Contest] Getting To Know You Bingo! Signups End 5/31, Contest Ends 6/15	MeghanAM	71	9	144	"Did you know that I spent one semester in the education program at my university? It was the particularly bad semester where I stopped attending things, but one of very few lessons that I attended was on ""classroom culture"" and icebreaking and stuff.  This is quite possibly something you did in elementary school.

Generally, you will answer some questions about yourself and list some other interesting facts about yourself.  Then you will get a bingo board with a bunch of facts on it, and you need to find the person who goes with that fact (by *pming them*, please do not question eachother on here because that would destroy the talking to eachother part!).  Everyone will have a different board.  First person to fill in any full straight line gets Bingo!

**How To Play**

1. To sign up, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IzY02kqO09CIH3if5gbT_2cZLbL4dMCAY15bUNwWnA4/viewform).  Almost none of the questions are required (you can tell by the little red star), but please fill out as many as possible and as you are comfortable with so I can get a good variety for the boards.  Signups close 5/31 11:59PM EST.

2. I will list the people who are playing up here somewhere.

3. Sometime on June 1st-2nd I will send you your board.

4. PM the other players to ask questions to fill out your board.  You can ask the person multiple questions in a PM, but please don't do anything that could be considered cheating.  Like please do not send them your board, or ask for the answers they've already found, or whatever.

5. Either physically edit your board in paint or something, or just write down the names next to numbers.  I will number the squares on your board and keep a copy of your board to make this easy.

6. When you've completed a line, send your answers to me!

**Rules**

1. Please respond truthfully to PMs that you get related to this game.  By signing up, you're agreeing to play, so it would be very rude to not reply to people.

2. Do not share your full board, answers that you provided to the survey as a full list, or the facts you have already learned about people with anyone.

3. Any evidence of cheating is a disqualification, and I probably won't let you play any other contest I do ever again either.  Cheating makes me grumpy.

**Prizes**

1. First prize will be like... $35 or so, to the first person who successfully completes a line.

2. Special prize of $25 to the first person who completely fills their board by the end of the contest.

3. A few small (~$5 or less) prizes will go to participants (exact number depends on budget and how much the prizes cost).  This will be drawn from the survey.

So really, I'm overwhelmed. I am not even sure what to say. 

This place means so so so much to me and I love all of you and I can't thank you enough. I seriously was afraid I was being dramatic about what I have accomplished this week, but the insane outpouring of support from everyone here has left me speechless. I am blown away and I am humbled and in awe of the power of reddit. 

It hasn't been an easy week. Some of you have heard about my (sexy) accident in which I have hurt my back and that hasn't helped and my head has just been murdering my for two days straight. But I feel so strong right now. I have my reddit army behind me. &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3

Thank you everyone so much. I still don't think I deserve it and my mail man is going to shit a brick! And seriously I will try to attempt justice to these things upon their arrival with thanks posts!!!

I love you all.

WACKY POINT AWARDING RULES &amp; HOW TO HELP YOUR TEAM:

Contest ends in 4 hours. When the contest closes, point-awarding will begin. The team with the most points will win. The leader of the winning team is guaranteed a gift, and the names of all the other members of the winning team will go into a hat for a drawing where at least 3 will be chosen to also receive gifts. Gifts will be awarded Friday.

* The first person to join each team will become that team's leader. 
* The five people who show the most team spirit will earn 20 points each for their team(s), even if they're all on the same team. Team spirit can be shown in many ways... be creative! Maybe your team has a motto or a fight song? Perhaps you can draw what your team's headquarters look like? Anything, really. Effort counts here. It's okay to edit your original comment up until the contest ends, as long as you don't switch teams.
* 5 points will be awarded to anyone who summons a RAoA member that ends up joining the same team. You may summon a maximum of 3 people, so choose wisely. The summoned member *must mention you* in their entry for it to count.
* Upvote everyone who is on the same team! The team with the most total upvotes (top-level comments only) will receive a 20 point bonus. Please do not downvote others, though. Downvotes will not be counted.
* Reddit Raffle will be run 10 times with the keywords *Go Team!*. For each person whose name comes up in Reddit Raffle, their chosen team will receive 10 points. This is the luck portion of the contest, but having more members on your team will increase your odds.

As many of you know it can be very easy to lose someone's reddit username when gifting, especially if they use their real name as part of the shipping info. It is totally fine to do that but can we please all put our reddit name *somewhere* on our wishlist - like in the ""About Me"" field. This will also work well if you come across a wishlist you really like while randoming and have to save for later - if you do that you will lose their reddit username.

1356364543.0	15dldr	[ Contest ] Random gifting on Christmas day, one of the big ones!	takibiker	75	13	214	I enjoy the ideal of the random act of kindness and when I found this sub-reddit I thought I would gift not in response to others but by rolling a pair of dice (10 sided) picking a birthday and gifting. As a member of the reddit Gold Lounge I will be rolling those dice and hitting the random button that many times and from that persons gift list I will go shopping for a $100 plus item and sending it on it's way. If that giftee has no items over $100 the dice will roll again !! MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone! EDIT: Going to bed soon (midnight east coast) I have gotten a real kick reading everyones comments and thank you all for saying such nice things, special thanks to our moderators answering questions and helping folks get setup for the wishlists! I shall return around ten tomorrow (eastern time) and play Santa!	t5_2tx47	True

1372032966.0	1gxr8u	[Contest] First 40 people to comment get an MP3 or a gift card.	gospy55	61	4	182	"Howdy :D

Another mass gifting contest. You have the choice of either an MP3 (as a courtesy, I'd like if you had MP3s that weren't $1.29, but that's not completely necessary) or a $.50 gift card. Please specify which you would like.

**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR EMAIL LISTED ON YOUR GIFT CARD, I WILL NOT GIFT YOU**^^^^^just kidding but really you should make sure you have it added.

If you requested an MP3, you will be gifted sooner. If you requested a gift card, it may take longer to get it.

Edit: *cough* This is awkward. My internet just slowed, so I may not be replying with your spot number. But that won't change anything.

Edit (March 1, 2 PM): Just a few more hours. The contest will close at 6 PM and a winner will be announced. :)

Okay, so my introduction post went well. And you're all awesome people. And I like shoes. Like... really like shoes. I wish I had more money so that I could have more shoes. But I don't. But I **do** have money to get a pair of shoes for **YOU**. So I'm gonna buy one of you lucky guys or gals a new pair of shoes! :D

Rules:

* Post a link to the pair of shoes that you want me to buy for you. I want a it to be a *specific* pair.
* Tell me why you want *those* shoes. What makes them the best shoes? What are you gonna do with them/why do you need them?
* Make sure that pair of shoes is in your wishlist. ;)
* This will be done by raffle so put the word **periwinkle** in your post. Your post still needs to meet the other requirements.
* Your account must have been created before February first.*
* The contest will end on the **first of March**^✝ at 6 PM (PST).

P.S. By shoes, I mean anything you want to wear on your feet. It can be slippers, heels, athletic, fashion, dress, sandals, flip-flops. Whatever you want. It can even be a pair of twelve-inch thigh-highs for your super sexy time with your significant other. There are no restrictions on what kind of footwear it is. Have fun!

1365710309.0	1c5n6t	[Thanks] Sp3cia1K, for the motivational shot in the arm I needed to start kicking butt on my kitchen remodeling project. The clock?? THE FREAKING CLOCK!?!? Not to mention all the project tools? I don't know where to begin to say thanks. Pics and story of happiness inside post.	damnyoureloud	59	4	38	"So, those of you that have known me for a while have probably heard my tale of attempting to update/renovate my parents' (and now my) 55-yo mid-century Levitt-built home.

The room in most desperate need is the kitchen. Original lead-painted metal cabinets that have not been sanded or re-painted since the house was built; broken and cracked asbestos floor tiles; every building hazard known to mid-century architecture. Lest you think I'm exaggerating, [here are a few pics](http://imgur.com/a/jcR9d) in all it's disgusting glory.

Since the money just doesn't exist for a true renovation, I'm going to just embrace the whole mid-century, funky vibe of the house and do what I can on a limited budget. So, I've decided fun and humor are the way to go. PaganPirate has dubbed it my ""kitsch-en"" project, which is my new favorite term ever!

I needed a quick project to get me started, so (with the help of some awesome RAOA gifts and tools) I reupholstered the kitsch-en chairs with [retro cowgirl fabrics](http://imgur.com/a/XcrV9). Next I began hand-sanding the metal cabinets. 8.5 hours later, with only 8 cabinets partially done and 16 more to go, plus 10 drawers/top panels, I broke down and bought an electric sander. And that's when my motivation ran dry.

Well, today I was outside picking up some trash that had blown into the yard when the UPS driver pulled up. I walked up to the truck and handed me a mid-size box from Amazon. My whole day and mood improved! Then he said, ""oh wait, I think I have one more for you"". He goes back into the truck and hands me out a [freaking huge box](http://imgur.com/vjiUG81) that measured about 3' x 3'. 

I opened the smaller box first, and found [these awesome remodeling aids](http://imgur.com/K6rqKsi) with a note from the amazing /u/Sp3cia1K that read ""I hope your remodel goes smoothly, and I hope this will help boost it on its way."" Welp, there was the emotional kick in the pants I needed, as well as many of the necessary tools to get the job done. But that still left the mysterious gigantazoid box to open.

Inside was an item I have been pining after ever since first discovering  it on Amazon. [The most kitsh-tastic freaking kitchen clock I have ever seen!](http://imgur.com/62AscH3) Even the flipping clock hands are kitchen utensils! Lol.

Sp3cia1K, I have no words to begin to thank you properly. This was sitting on my ""Dream"" wishlist with no expectation of anyone ever actually buying it for me. It was more one of those ""if I ever actually finish this project, I'm treating myself to this as the crowning glory"" types of thing. If this isn't all the motivation I need to start kicking lead paint and asbestos ass, I don't know what is!

I am so knocked out, happy, and grateful right now! You freaking rock, and I love you to pieces. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"	t5_2tx47	True

[Link to the old Thread](http://redd.it/16a4db)

You are cordially invited to the second ""Amazon Bomb"" mass gifting spree extravaganza: Electric Boogaloo this evening located at a place to be determined. We will edit this thread with the correct information as we get it. 

However as a pre-game warm-up I will be hosting MOVIE DAY all day in the synchtube room: [Found here](http://synchtube.com/r/RAofA#/button/c/blue)

This evening we will be giving away two pots worth of prizes. Here's how the exact gifting tiers will break down.

* Note: ""The Garbage Heap"" is the remainder of the gifted balance. We will gift **up to** the amount of the tier you've won. If you have a small list  then that balance remaining will roll over. We will give away as much as this as possible to the last dollar/pound.

-----------------**AMAZON.CO.UK**--------------------

A GRAND TOTAL OF **168.00 BRITISH POUNDS** WILL BE GIFTED TO A POOL OF **6 AMAZONIANS**. 

* **Tier 1:** **GRAND PRIZE: 84 POUNDS WINNER: scethao**
* **Tier 2:** **2nd PRIZE: 42 POUNDS - WINNER: eilianfae**

Note: YES ALL OF YOU GET GIFTED :D CONGRATS! We had a **very** generous anonymous gifter and a few americans who contributed to the pot. 

----------------**AMAZON.COM**-------------------------

A GRAND TOTAL OF **$1,179.52** will be gifted today to a pool of **80 AMAZONIANS** Sadly, due to the sheer amount of folks we will NOT Gift you all.

* **Tier 1:** **GRAND PRIZE: $589 WINNER - toothfairy32**
* **Tier 2:** **2nd PRIZE: $294 WINNER - exgirlfriend82**
* **Tier 3:** **3rd PRIZE: $100 WINNER - cinnameoba**

* **Tier 17:** **17th PRIZE: $10 WINNER - scarlettenoir**
* **Tier 18:** **THE GARBAGE HEAP** **WINNER - $13.57 - faxinating**

Alright some final notes on how this will work.

* /u/Dersevvak will be the man behind the current working the 1s and 2s on this thing. Our selection process for winners will include a random number lottery from random.org. We will have your names times the amount of entries on a spreadsheet. 

* We will be using your wishlist in your flair and any lists attached to that list you've linked.

* If your name is called, you win that tier. You will win only 1 tier. Your name will be disqualified for the rest of the gifting to give others a chance to win. 

* The fun part about this (and hopefully it'll be super easy in the synchtube) is that the **Audience** watching the LIVE gifting will be selecting your prizes a la polls on synchtube or Whose Line is it Anyways? style cat calling. 

* The Garbage Heap will be the final gifting. We will try to empty the balance down to the last dollar. If we cannot, we will just apply the balance to the NEXT Bomb (Which will probably be in July/August. If not sooner)

**THANK YOU** To all of you who have donated. You've made this the single biggest gifting in the history of me doing this shindig. Also to the modsquad who I love dearly. Thanks for putting up with my crap guys. Finally to the rest of you all SIX THOUSAND PLUS. We started this little sub with 10-20 people rotating in and out and now we have one of the most active random acts subs on reddit. Lets get to #1 shall we? REMEMBER BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER AND BE IN THE SYNCHTUBE!

1357231146.0	15w7f5	[Discussion]My favorite thing about the picture post...	shorinbb	67	10	130	...was that when I looked through which was at about 800 or 900 comments at the time, not one bad thing was said about anyone.  Everyone was encouraging and uplifting.  Maybe that changed now that the comments have doubled but I highly doubt that.  In addition to that, walnutwhale posted something nice about each picture (when it was around 800 or 900 comments, I haven't looked since).  That took a lot of dedication to keep up with that post!  So not only are we the handsomest group of people we are also the kindest group of people on reddit!  Seriously, a thread that kind wouldn't happen anywhere else!

It's like an exclusive club that only people with birthdays can join! So, as long as you have a birthday, just post it on here and you're allowed in :D


It's really helpful for indecisive people trying to choose who to gift, as well as letting everyone on RAOA know that it's your birthday so they gift you and remind you how awesome you are!


***

When you post your birthday here, make sure that you have your [wishlist link](http://imgur.com/a/IfR8W) set as your [flair](http://imgur.com/a/SLC8t) and you're good to go! If you need to update the link or let me know that you have added one, just *make a new post*, don't reply to a previous one so I can see it easier, and I will change it asap!


**Once I let you know that I have added your birthday, PLEASE check that I added everything correctly!** I'm putting all of this in manually, and mistakes do happen occasionally, so feel free to let me know if you find anything that needs to be fixed. :)

**Update - 1/18/13:** I got a little behind again, but I'm working on getting caught up! You **CAN** still add your birthday to the list, it's not too late at all! I apologize again to everyone that I didn't get to on time, I hope you still had great birthdays! :D

As an update on what's going on with my dad for those of you keeping up with it, he finished his chemo on December 26th, and had stents put in his heart on the 16th. He's doing great now, and should finally be done with all of this! Thank you all for the well wishes and such, it really does mean a lot to me and my family :)

To everyone having difficulty adding their wishlist to their flair, I edited this post with links to guides on how 
to do it. They're in the middle section of this post if you need them. Let me know if you still need any help getting it added!"	t5_2tx47	True
