I am a British citizen living and working in The Philippines. 
I have been here for a little over nine years.   

So,    

what's the deal? 

1) Ayala Corp rape your country every minute of every day. Every peso they spend here is for the benefit of foreign corporations who exploit the cheap labor (a factor that provides deep motivation to keep the population under educated and underfed) and set up the many sweatshops found throughout the country.    

2) The wealthy elite talk loudly about ""Filipino Pride"" whilst sending their heirs abroad to be educated. The richest families could transform the education system here but don't. Why? Again, it does not serve their interests to create a healthy, wealthy population.    

3) Why aren't you **demanding** better education, socialized medical care and an end to the endemic corruption? If people won't listen you have a **moral responsibility** to remove the leaders by force if necessary.

4) Why do you continue to follow the religion that was *used to subjugate, placate and control you*? The immoral teachings of the Catholic Church are going to destroy this country as the population becomes unsustainable. HIV is spreading due to poor sex education (the Philippines now ranks second in the world for new cases of HIV infection) and the Catholic Church's insistence that condoms are evil.    

5) Prostitution is illegal and yet foreigners flock to the Philippines from all over the world to exploit and abuse your children. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.    

6) Why do so many Filipinos turn into fucking assholes the moment they start driving?    

So, what gives?

However, what I do not share and could no longer personally support was the hatred he spread. He, the one who called out the racism that unfortunately exists here, did it in such a way that it would only add fuel to the fire. Rather than trying to point it out politely and humbly he would step in and throw acid in people's face. How he thinks he could achieve anything with it is beyond me.

Let's clear up the air about the Lahad Datu situation	ArmandTanzarianMusic	97	7	99	"Before I start I'd like to ask a favour from both sides: **No flame wars and overt nationalism**.  I kindly ask the mods to help enforce this. My purpose is for me (and Malaysians) to ask some questions on the viewpoints of Philipinos on the Lahad Datu standoff, and vice versa. This will be linked in /r/malaysia, and I'll answer some queries (and think of more) when I get back from work.

1. What's the general view on-the-street about the Sulu Sultanate and the standoff? The view may be different between Manila and Mindanao. How do you see the bunch in Sabah as, invaders or freedom fighters?

2. How is the Pinoy media portraying the standoff? Do you think Aquino is doing the right thing so far, and what do you think of the Malaysian army's and government's actions today.

3. In your opinion, does the Sulu Sultanate still exist? If yes, do you think the historical claims still apply to the modern Philippines or even (touch wood) a hypothetical independent state of Muslim Mindanao? What do you think should be done to the various claimants of the Royal House?

4. Personal interest point: How are your nationalists portraying this? The craziest xenophobes usually type/rant in their own language, and since I can't read Tagalog, I'm missing out on the extreme viewpoints I think.

That's all I have for you. I'm awaiting your questions as well, they're instructive as to how we're portrayed in your country.

EDIT: Thanks for the constructive answers, you guys have been very kind and very understanding. Like you I definitely hope this can be resolved ASAP, with no more lives lost.

One day I was in a tricycle with a friend, and saw a worn, yellowed book, ""Ang Tundo Man May Langit Din"" on the ""dashboard"" inside. I got really excited and told my friend that my HS Filipino Literature class required me to read it and that I was impressed by it. Friend immediately said in his loud and assuming voice, ""Oh, then maybe a student passenger left it!""

I was silent, fearing that the tricycle driver heard. Moving a few meters more, the tricycle driver told us, ""do you know how Lapu-Lapu died?"" And I smiled the biggest smile! I was about to hear a corny joke, I was sure of it!! (Books and corny jokes are my source of happiness.)

My friend also smiled, a very different and sarcastic one, and challenged the driver, ""I forgot. How did he die?""

I didn't get the corny joke I expect to hear. The driver proceeded to tell us about the real story of it all, the kind of story that kasaysayan professors in universities would cry tears of joy for. He then proceeed to talk about all national heroes in their respective glorious moments, with emotion in his voice. His fondness for Bonifacio, his hatred for Aguinaldo, his respect for Rizal, his *x* feeling for hero *y*... emotions louder than the sound of the tricycle moving us to our destination. Our respect for him increasing with each word he said.

When we reached our destination, he told us in a calm yet confident manner, ""I read books in my spare time, and buy books whenever I can afford it. My mother never sent me to high school, but I really wanted to study history. I regret not studying, so even though I'm a tricycle driver, I have sent all my children to college doing the courses they love.""

He added with a smile directed to me, ""you students are the lucky people and I hope you two study well."" (End)

**tl;dr friend thought a literary book inside the tricycle was left by a student, but was really read by a driver who inspired us to cherish school**

Do you guys have memorable taxi/tricycle/train stories too? :D This is the most memorable of mine, but really, I've plenty of smaller ""good driver"" stories :)"	t5_2qjov	True
1349150153.0	10ssw9	The day I got married. 	anis9	100	14	39	"I got married in the city hall. The mayor was supposed to conduct the thing but she cancelled. A priest was asked to replace her and he was late. I didn't even understand why a priest was needed because my wife and I wanted to be married by the state. He was wearing a gold watch, gold cross, and was an hour late. Those are the things I remember when I think of that priest.

He asks the people getting married to sign the attendance form and also asked us to indicate our religion. I wrote Atheist. I thought the form was meant for them to not offend other religions but it didn't matter. We started with a prayer and then a sermon for an hour. A priest telling us what family means. What sex means. What having kids mean. All are things he doesn't know fuck all about.

I was pissed. My wife and I chose to be married by the state to avoid this stupid ritual. Here's the kicker.

He tells us, a group of multi-religious people that ""One cannot have a happy marriage without Jesus in the family."" Everyone was visibly pissed because the pre wedding ritual took so long and now he's offending the Muslims and Agnostics. How dare he say that when he has that form he asked us to fill out and 5 people on that list wrote something else other than ""Catholic"". I wanted to Hitchslap him. I didn't. Everyone just went along with it. No one wanted to ruin their wedding day, me included. My wife and I made an involuntary audible yet subdued chuckle when he said this Jesus comment. Outside I was smiling, inside I was fuming. I kept reminding myself how important this day is for my wife.
 
When it came time to say the vows, he asked us to repeat his words. This is where I took a stand. I look my wife in the eyes and said...

""I love you. Don't look at him or anyone else but me. Ignore him. We will speak our own words. This is our moment not his or Jesus'. We will start a family. I will do anything for you and no religion, government, or man can stop me from loving you the way we were meant to love each other, not dictated by this man....""

I went on longer and declared my desire to give my wife a better life one day. Away from all this. We've talked numerous times of moving to Canada. I say this with a voice of confidence and everyone can hear me saying something different from what the priest is saying. I tried to speak over the loud mic the priest was using so my wife can hear. The Christian couple beside us, drenched in sweat by the long procession, smiled as they noticed us talking differently. I understood what that smile meant.

After the vows were exchanged, the priest went around asking couples if they wanted pictures with him. It's normal here to have a priest in your wedding photo along with your family. Everyone took pictures with the priest that day, until he came to us. I said, ""No thank you. Family only.""

This is the story of my wedding day."	t5_2qjov	True

You have to understand that Philippines is not a country of the middle class, it is a mob nation. Have you seen our poor? They just go ahead and clean your shoe without you asking, and expect to get paid. They sleep under ATM Machines and eat in plastic containers, all without complaint. ANd you'd think why? How can the government not do anything about this? 

Why should they? These people are practically election farms, just the way they are.

80% is considered poor,  20% is middle class, and &gt;1% high class. You want change from the government? Well you can't get it, because the two giants youre against wants the status quo to stay. The poor, helpless with what they have, clinging to the politicians for bought votes. And the rich, who are mostly the politicians themselves, coupled with their self-interest in their respective business. 

It is against the politicians' interest to nurture the middle-class, and that is why you keep on seeing them in election season parading the squatters area, singing videoke, while the people know shit about their platforms. Lemme ask you why you voted for noynoy, and people will answer either ""kasi kung walang corrupt walang mahirap"" or ""son of cory and ninoy"" as if these reasons are enough to vote a president of poor senate performance. And you know what? It *is* enough, for the votes that matter, that is. 

And you'll find out that this Aquino is friends with that Ayala, and you will then understand why the Ayala's are still there, in power, celebrating the fact that by maintaining the poor, we still keep paying people dirt shit wages. And that  the Aquino's Luisita farm will never receive what is due to them, but that's ok. Their votes don't matter. The majority will still be drones for whatever shit the media, ruled by the Lopez - Aquinos friend - will feed them. And what about the healthcare? The rich can handle it, and the poor can go ahead with a low quality free service from at-the-corner clinics. Heck, some even have free lodging if they don't pay their fees because they **get to stay in the hospital if they don't pay.** 

You tell us why can't we solve the corruption? By all means, tell us how! Corruption will never be gone as long the system, our world wide system, incentivises it. Please do correct me when I say that corruption is universal, the same way that Murdoch is buying your politicians. Our politicians, being businessmen themselves, are buying the poor's votes. With the middle class's tax money, no less!

The only group who I think would and should benefit from change is the middle class, and it has always bugged me what the fuck's impeding us to want it? Then I saw facebook, people complaining about how their prenuptial photoshoot went wrong or hey-our-pictures-from-this-country, etc etc. Then I realize I am still typing in this computer to reply to something that made me angry. I sicken myself. Then I've realized just now that the middle class does not necessarily *not* want change, but it's just that they'd rather do something else. Oh we want change, but we just want something else *more*.

I was not really angry with the entry per se, he had a legitimate question. Really, what is the deal with us Filipinos? And I understand that he doesn't know better. But what really got to me is how pathetically apologetic some Filipinos were, blaming our oh so popular self-generalizations and deprecations. That just sickens me. Some, were actually hopeful. Like the student who [plans to distribute wealth among provinces by setting up internet cafes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ohvba/the_philippines_from_a_foreign_point_of_view/c3hnp21). I for one, am inspired by that. We need to nurture these ideas, because if we don't, no other class shares our want. Otherwise, do pray to all the gods that somehow the rich will be altruistic, or the 80% poor will suddenly need to be beyond themselves. 

In my humble opinion, it is in our best interest to expand the middle class. And it only is in our hands to do so. How, I'm still finding that out my self. And if we have, I really think the Philippines would be better for it. :) 

Thanks for listening.

TL;DR - Stop assuming we're a middle class country, and start acting like we want to be one.

&gt;tl;dr version: (not in order) Ping is not reliable, PLDT sucks, Garena needs to spend more on connectivity, use WinMTR instead of tracert, government needs public IX.

&gt;Hi all, I'm a foreigner living in Manila that has spent the last 15 years building large scale networks in Europe, with a heavy focus on northern Europe. I apologize in advance that I do not speak Tagalog (yet) so I'm only able to write this in English.

&gt;I've read a lot of posts here on the forums, and although they are mostly well meant, most are factually wrong. I contribute this to lack of knowledge in terms of carrier grade networking so it's completely understandable so let's start by defining what lag (latency) is. Also this is focused at our specific situation - playing LoL in Philippines.

&gt;For a game such as LoL you have 4 layers of possible latency:

&gt;* 1) Consumer end (PC/Router/Bandwidth)
* 2) ISP
* 3) Interconnect/Transit

&gt;To measure latency end-to-end ICMP echo (PING) packets are not a reliable tool. There are many reasons for this but for us the main reason is that ICMP is a down prioritized packet type. Historically the ping tool was meant to see if a host was alive, not to measure connectivity - the reason it does have response times were to identify possible routing errors or DNS IP mixups. Remember this tool is older than most people playing LoL.

&gt;On Windows 'tracert' uses ICMP echo requests to probe the route of the connection to your destination. If you do want to trace the route using ICMP echo I can recommend WinMTR as a replacement for tracert that is a lot faster and more accurate. WinMTR can be found here. The UNIX version has an option to do UDP based packets which is more relevant for us as UDP is usually used in online gaming because of reduced latency and overhead as compared to TCP.

&gt;In Europe the infrastructure and government laws are usually very good and the laws enforced. This means that the most common causes of latency is on the consumer end. People mostly have ADSL connections and forget they have something running in the background (seeding is the main culprit in most cases) as with ADSL when you saturate your uplink you obliterate your downlink. But here in Philippines there are a lot of other causes for latency for us gamers - the worst being PLDT - yes you read that right, PLDT is intentionally disrupting online gaming in the Philippines. I will explain in greater detail below.

&gt;PLDT (and SMART) are actively fighting interconnect laws here in the Philippines. This is done mostly because of the mobile market but internet (and thus gaming) suffers as a result. Because SMART (and with the purchase of Sun) has the dominant market share, they are not interested in interconnecting with other Telcos, but specifically they do not want Globe subscribers to be satisfied with Globe so they will switch to SMART - this is why they are limiting the interconnect between PLDT and Globe, they are essentially throttling the data exchange between the companies. This is against the law here in Philippines but as with a lot of other things here, money talks - morale walks. I assume you've experienced long delays on texting between Globe/SMART?

&gt;Here is a recent article on the problem.

&gt;Keep in mind that that interconnection is standard in other markets and I've never come across any other Telco being as manipulative towards their customers as PLDT/SMART.

&gt;So what does SMS delays have to do with LoL latency you ask? Well the biggest problem here is that by default PLDT routes all domestic traffic via an IX in HK. This means if you send data between a PLDT DSL subscriber and any other major ISP here it goes via a Hong Kong Internet eXchange. There is a law passed in Philippines that all ISPs have to interconnect freely via an Internet eXchange so data can flow freely between the customers of the ISPs. Mind you this does not mean that a Globe/Sky/Bayan/Eastern customer can access data/servers outside PLDTs network, through PLDTs network - this is entirely between customers of the ISPs. This is common practice all over the world, even in dictatorships - except in Philippines.

&gt;ISPs buy transit traffic through backbone providers like PACNET, Level3, UUNet etc. - these are the services that connect your ISP to the world, it's too expensive for all ISPs to run their own international backbone fibers.

&gt;Because of PLDTs enormous power they have been able to defy the laws of interconnection and because of this keep prices up and bandwidth down as a whole in Philippines. I'm not saying that the other Telcos here are angels but at least their obey the law of interconnection. Doesn't it seem odd that Philippines is so far behind in terms of bandwidth/price for internet? It's literally 10 year behind Europe in it's current state.

&gt;It's worth noting that Globe has a stake in the worlds most powerful sea fiber. This is why PLDT is scared that if they loose their stranglehold on the consumers here that they will realize that the competitor offers a superior product. Unfortunately Globe has some of the least educated support staff/customer service in Philippines so it's not all roses on the 'other side'.

&gt;I can give you a concrete example of how full PLDT is of themselves - I was involved in a project in Philippines (which is when I fell in love with the country and moved here afterwards) that also involved PACNET. I was dumbfounded why the routing in Philippines was all over the place, I was trying to understand whom or what was the cause of this terrible infrastructure so I could fix it, eventually I narrowed it down to PLDT being incompetent. As I met with the senior technicians from PACNET regarding a multi-gigabit transit setup here in Manila I asked them why PLDTs routing was all over the place, as they are the major operator it was important for us to have good connectivity with PLDT. The PACNET technician and the senior sales manager explained to me that of all the countries they do business in, Philippines was the only place where a Telco willing and carelessly broke conventional international norms. PACNET had been dumbfounded when PLDT asked PACNET to pay PLDT when PLDT wanted to buy backbone capacity from PACNET. Their reasoning was that without PLDT you could not service the general public in Philippines properly so that's why PLDT should get money for allowing their customers direct access to PACNET. I'll let that sink in a little.

&gt;PACNET is a company who's main business is SELLING backbone capacity across South East Asia and PLDT wanted PACNET to pay so PLDT could get backbone capacity from PACNET. It is so stupid that it completely blows my mind.

&gt;Everything else they explain perfectly matched what I had seen examining the Philippines' internet infrastructure. Unfortunately to remedy this situation you need non-corrupt representatives that also understands technology or the need for improving the infrastructure as a whole in Philippines - not being able to vote here was a relief as I doubt there are any.

&gt;To summarize:

&gt;Garena needs to supply us with an IP where we can do UDP based pings to have reliable connectivity diagnostics.

&gt;If Garena is relying solely on the standard connectivity at VITRO (ePLDT), then they need to invest in their own connectivity to Globe and Bayan/Sky.

&gt;The Filipino government needs to create a unified IX, that mandates you have to interconnect a certain bandwidth pr. subscriber with a minimum bandwidth of 1 Gigabit. Make it so that you loose the right to do Telco services if you are not connected to the public IX. (this would solve all connectivity issues for someone like Garena at zero cost to Garena and all other companies doing online services in Philippines).

GanasbinTagap	73	12	52	"I once met a Filipino lady by the bus stop and we started talking about different things, when she found out that I was from Sabah she suddenly said that Sabah belongs to the Philippines. She couldn't really explain why exactly we did, even when I pointed out that at no time in history was Sabah ever part of the Philippines.


I have nothing against Filipinos, and I admire the national pride you guys have when it comes to the Philippines, but every time the topic of Sabah comes into the picture, it seems that there is no room for the voice of the Sabahan. 

We are a small a nation that is part of Malaysia, and we are treated like a colony that is up for grabs by the government of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Our lands are being taken by West Malaysians, claimed by Tausug speaking rebels, yet no one has given a Sabahan a chance to trully voice his/her opinions.

I am a Dusun. I am indigenous to Sabah. My ancestors have never pledged allegiance to any foreign ruler prior to the British. I would like to ask /r/Philippines what they think of the whole Sabah claim and if you would like, feel free to ask an actual Sabahan anything.

***Disclaimer: my country kills children in Pakistan with unmanned drones. There are parts of my country that are extremely racist, and kill gays. The subject of this post is not ""We Americans are so superior to Filipinos."" It's ""I'm used to my weird stuff, and not the weird stuff over here, and I want to scream.""

My kids have these friends who live in our condo. They're Koreans, and their names are Kevin and Arnold. My kids have a ton of fun with them, and I'm really thankful that they have them as friends.

Kevin and Arnold are typical Koreans. They get five hours of sleep a night and spend all of their time on weekdays studying, getting tutoring, taking lessons, and stuff like that. They come from a culture where children literally worship their parents, even after their death, and parents are brutal, very critical of their children, make all of their decisions into adulthood, and are very strict.

Kevin and Arnold go to an international school and also spend a lot of time (on Saturdays) at our house. They see how Western families run. They realize that they're the only ones that have lives and parents like theirs. Arnold is in therapy because he has outbursts of physical violence. Kevin is really nice and doesn't have those, but he has a nervous twitch. The pressure is breaking them.

One day, Arnold said to me ""How many hours a week do your kids get to play?""

-""I don't know. When they're not at school or doing homework, they play.""

-""No. I mean how many hours do they have to study?""

-""As many as they need to do their homework. Then they play all day.""

-""That's not fair.""

-""Ok.""

-""They will be poor when they grow up.""

-""Americans raise their kids like this, and they grow up to make more money than Koreans, on average.""

Arnold looked at my like he might cry. I had just gently told him his life was a lie. It was a dumb thing to have said to the poor kid, already buckling under the stress of having a harder life than the people around him, but he was telling me that my parenting was bad and my kids would be poor, and I reacted poorly.

Filipinos aren't like Koreans, exactly, but there are still things in the parent/child and teacher/child relationship which are deeply disturbing from someone who comes from a culture that worships freedom and happiness.

Filipinos don't make their kids study and work all day like Korean, Chinese, and Japanese parents do. But my kids' teachers still yell at them, punish kids, humiliate kids, and one of my oldest son's teachers recently called him ""gay"" when she was angry. In the world I'm used to, a teacher would be sued and banned from teaching for life for that, (A) for using ""gay"" as an insult and (B) for trying to humiliate a kid.

I'm a professor. My students talk about loving their parents more than their future spouses, and continuing to obey their parents after marriage. One of my really good friends is in her 20s. Her mom (who lives in abroad and hasn't seen her in years) has just decided she has to undergo a cosmetic procedure. My friend doesn't want it and doesn't need it and thinks it's ridiculous, but thinks it would be horrible to simply tell her mother so.

In America, a parent who told their adult child to what to wear or what job to work or what they had to study would possibly be given therapy or medication. Filipinos dutifully comply with their controlling parents though, because they love them so much and feel like they'll never repay the debt they incurred by being born. They don't stop and think--wait: if my parents actually loved me so much, why the hell would they treat me like a tyrant treats their peasant subjects?

The same thing seems to go for religion. The same thing seems to go for work. It definitely goes for education. The people not in authority unquestioningly spend all of their time and effort doing ridiculous stuff that doesn't make anyone happier, more educated, or richer, because they're told to. The people in authority feel no need to prove that anything (teaching methods, cosmetic procedures, meetings, whatever) is actually benefiting anyone, because they just expect to be obeyed, because obeying is somehow right.

So what does this mean for me, you ask? I don't have to deal with controlling parents or churches. So why should this bother me?

It bothers me because people can believe as I do and want what I do, but can never really incorporate their lives with mine because of their many totalitarian bosses. Say, in theory, we fell in love with someone here and wanted to drag them off with us to live on a beach in a polyamorous commune, and cultivate their soul and make them breakfast every morning and buy them paintbrushes or horses or whatever and help them live life as whatever it was they were born to be--whatever their soul was created for. It would be impossible. The person would say ""no, I have to do X,Y,Z and be A,B,C, because that's what the bosses told me. It doesn't matter that since I was a child I dreamed of [chess/obscure languages/whatever]. That's not my destiny. My destiny is to do what I'm told.""

So, romantic relationships here are pretty much impossible. Friendships, even, are strangely difficult. And that's why I'm depressed.

Filipinos *need* access to contraception and sexual education. To clarify, I’m Christian, and I am pro-life. Though, living in America has made me respect the separation of church and state, my arguments for pro-life are not entirely religious. No disrespect meant towards them, but there are way too many people my age (even younger) and those not too much older than us who have had unplanned pregnancies. Kudos to them for not aborting them, but a lot of these teen mothers just leave their kids to their parents or yayas and continue to get wasted every Friday night.

I don’t think the Scripture is against contraception. I think the Pope is. You can’t pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true in order to favor your views. Yes, a man and woman were meant to reproduce, but not all men and women will. Also, the verses “against” contraception are from the Old Testament. A lot of the rules in the Old Testament need to be understood in context. During biblical times, family lineage is most important. Women are devalued and their only purpose is to create children—nothing else. That’s why rapists were required to marry their victims; no one would marry a non-virgin, so she is given a husband, etc.

So many of these “rules” are no longer followed in modern society because we’re just that—modern society. It’s against these rules to wear different kinds of fabrics at the same time, to be near a woman when she’s on her period, and to wear clothes of the opposite sex. Abortion is wrong, and proper contraception is good. In my opinion, sex outside of marriage is wrong. Yes, the Bible also says that, but to me, it’s also because in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, you’re not mature enough to care for a child (especially when you’re just out partying). Being a bastard myself, I understand how unplanned pregnancies can ruin the lives of those who aren’t ready to be parents. When my parents had me, their baby shower gifts were sex toys when baby shower gifts are supposed to be diapers, baby clothes, etc, to help the family because babies cost a lot, etc.

Also, life begins at *conception*. Conception = mama egg is fertilized by papa sperm. Apparently it’s such a bad thing that the sperm doesn’t meet the egg, but do people not realize how many times a day a guy ejaculates… There are *so many* benefits to contraception, not just avoiding unplanned babies. The birth control has a lot of health benefits for women (period stuff, skin stuff, etc).

Overpopulation is a BAD thing. Overpopulation = poverty. China “makes everything” because of cheap labor (yes, that’s a bad thing, too). They’re actually not well off economically.

The RH Bill is not a “HEY LET ME SHOVE THIS IN YOUR FACE DO THIS DO THAT ETC” deal. It’s free choice.

Condoms are NOT the cause of the spread of AIDS (see what happens when you lack sex education?). They actually prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

The RH Bill is still *against* abortion. What the bill proposes would actually decrease the need for it. Please explain to me how this is “against human life.”

Gusto naman kasi ng informal settlers, lahat lahat gobyerno na ang sumagot, pati tubig at kuryente. Bakit kaya hindi sila maghanap ng maprinsipyong trabaho, oo, di sila nakapag-aral, sige, pero maraming trabaho na di na kelangan ng diploma, basta may sipag lang at tyaga. Oo, mahihirap lang sila pero di kailangan iasa lahat sa gobyerno, gawa-gawa din para sa sarili. Paano matututo ang isang tao kung binibigyan lang pero di tinuturuan kung paano mag-""earn"". Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. 

Di sa lahat ng oras, maibibigay ang kagustuhan. Pinaghihirapan po ang pambayad ng kuryente, tax at kung ano pa. Hindi po hinihingi. Nakakahiya naman ano po. Kung sa bagay, pag-gamit lang din ng mga pulitiko to para makakuha ng maraming boto. Sa mahihirap kumakapit. Paano ang mga middle class people na naghihirap din sa kakatrabaho? Wala ba silang makukuhang konting ""pagpapababy""? Yung mga nagtatrabaho sa ibang bansa para sa pamilya dito sa pinas. Yung mga mayayaman na nanggaling din sa kahirapan pero umangat dahil sa pagsisikap, wala rin? Ayos ano po.

Might as well be an informal settler, all of us. Para baby-hin lahat ng Pilipino. Kaya di umaasenso kasi tinuturuang maging tamad.

**EDIT (Translation):** Why is that? What informal settlers want is that the government should pay for everything including water bills, electric bills and such. Why don't they look for honorable jobs? Yes, they didn't go to school like us but there are a lot of jobs that don't require a diploma. Just diligence and perseverance. Yes, they're poor but they don't need to rely it all to the government. They need to do it on their own as well. How will a person learn if they keep on giving him things and not teaching them how to earn? *Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. *

Not all the time, they'd get what they want. Work hard for you to pay bills and taxes. You don't ask for it. Apparently, the government is using these things to get votes from them for the next election. They hold on to the poor people. How about the middle-class people who are working their asses off? Those Overseas Filipino Workers? The rich people who came from poverty? Don't they deserve to be spoiled by the government?

We'd like to put in a **new logo** for the subreddit *(currently the blacked out reddit alien)* and thought it might be a good time to get logo submissions from you guys. We're fairly certain there are many of you who are creative enough to come up with a great logo :)

How this works: 

* Submit and upvote as many logos as you want. The one with the most upvotes will be used.

* To make the voting easier and more precise, **one submission per comment** please.

* File size: The default header image is 120x40. The modified version can be of any dimension or file size, but is recommended to keep it no wider than 300 and shorter than 100. The file size is strongly recommended to be within 100Kb as not all users have 10MB+ connections.

* Last day for submissions and voting will be on the **21st of this month**.

* Mods reserve the right to pick the next most upvoted submission if they find the winning submission inappropriate, NSFW, NSFL, NSFS, or just generally offensive ಠ_ಠ

Yep, that's basically it. Good luck and have fun :)

Not gonna downplay it. I'm a football fan and a supporter of the Philippine football team. I'm also very familiar with the rotten side of journalism for TV in this country. 

I don't know anything about the Christy Ramos sexual harassment case because I wasn't there. I personally think it's a misunderstanding that Ramos *should* have taken up with Federation first, not the media. 

But that's not what bothers me so much about this video. I can't believe someone like Arnold Clavio is allowed to say something like ""**Hindi naman kayo kayumanggi. Hindi kayo Pilipino.**"" on national TV.

Whatever you wanna call his spiel, crab mentality, hate speech - it was plain downright racist. Unfortunately, he's not the only one who feels this way. 

I know there are a lot people out there who don't think half-Filipinos are true Filipinos. I feel like the only way to address this is to *talk about it*. 

I don't know if anyone's up for it, but I think it might be helpful and enlightening (as reddit can get). If you guys want to contribute your 2 cents, go ahead.

P.S. Sorry mods, I'm new to posting. I think I sent you guys a PM earlier, thinking that was the way to go

**EDIT:** I love how this post has taken off. I just want to ask everybody an additional question - do you guys think the Philippine Football Team is Filipino? 

**EDIT2:** The Philippine Football Federation formally filed a public complaint against Arnold Clavio regarding what he said. They send the complaint to GMA. Here is a scanned copy PFF posted via Twitter:  http://twitpic.com/8wjd5r"	t5_2qjov	True

My parents went out to pick my brother from school and when they returned, Mattu was not in his usual spot, which is high up on a table sleeping in his dog bed. 

We tried scour the whole neighborhood with no luck. We also checked with pet stores. My mom suggested we check with animal control or shelter for a listing of found pets when we realized that we don't have them in Philippines, or at least in our area. While our neighborhood is notoriously known for murdering stray dogs for consumption, which is very fucking twisted, I refuse to entertain the idea that my dog was butchered because he's not even enough to produce one measly, quivering, serving of dog meat. 

We are in Angeles City, Pampanga. Mattu is 2.5-year old short haired, black tricolor chihuahua. Please help me find my dog. :'(

Thank you po.

The title of the exhibition is a word play on the Tagalog for mustache ‘bigote’ and the English ‘bigoted’ which describes an intolerant or narrow minded individual. This provides a playful entry point into issues of discrimination faced by the LGBT community through a surreal installation made up of idealized male and female forms being attacked by mustachioed gold scissors.

1359109946.0	17902y	I'm Chinoy but there are aspects of my society that I have a hard time dealing with [Rant of sorts]	floatinglotus	40	8	119	"I'm pure Chinese but I used the term Chinoy for convenience's sake. I grew up in a traditional Chinese family that lived in Binondo and I studied in a Chinese school until college. I'd rather not reveal what college I went to, but it's not DLSU (where Chinoys prefer to send their kids to).

In college, I was exposed to more people from various walks of life. I can say that college made me more liberal and open-minded, and while I'm not totally so, I feel that I've gone a long way compared to before. Spending some time studying abroad also helped.

Ever since, though, I've found myself feeling more and more distant with Chinoy society, particularly the older generation. Those who are around my age (I'm in my mid-20s, so I mean those slightly older/younger than I am) are mostly fine, but there are many traditional values that I have difficulty accepting/dealing with.

Basically, what bothers me is that Chinoy society is not that progressive, especially because the elders are stubborn and controlling, while the young ones are hesitant and scared to disrupt the status quo (and, unfortunately, we can't really blame them). I don't know if it's just the elders that I've been exposed to, but I find that many of the elders are very bigoted. Namely:

1. They're racist (especially when it comes to romantic relationships with Pinoys, though some  of the extreme types are against romantic relationships or even friendship with anyone who's not Chinese, period) - I know some people who've been threatened with disownment just because their parents cannot accept that they won't date within their race. While I know that part of this distrust towards foreigners, particularly Pinoys, is due to racism that they (the Chinese) have been subjected to in the past, as well as kidnapping and other incidents of Sinophobia, Sinophobia has largely decreased these days, and people with misconceptions towards Chinoys seem to be more ignorant than hateful, so I feel that it's unfair to look down on all Pinoys and foreigners because a few bad apples ruined it for everyone.

2. They're sexist - I often get crap that basically amounts to ""act like Maria Clara because you're a girl; proper girls don't do [whatever they find unladylike]""). Also, as another example, a relative said that taking further studies is a bad idea, because if I get too intelligent and liberal, I will make men insecure. Generally, their outlooks towards women and men have this underlying implication that men that aren't family are perverts, and that women are delicate flowers that should be sheltered and protected.

3. They always think they're right, no questions asked, and they act like they're superior to younger people because they're older. Point out the inherent contradictions in the illogical things they say and they'll still insist they're right. When they run out of ways to defend their position, they'll just tell you to listen to them just because. IMHO, older people don't always know better. I appreciate getting advice and guidance, but when they always put younger people down and try to override other people's thoughts, I think that's too much.

4. They're homophobic - I get that it's too much of a stretch for them to be pro-same-sex marriage, and I don't expect them to be that open-minded, given that they grew up differently. But some of the things they say about homosexuals are horrible, which makes me feel really bad for my homosexual Chinese friends.

5. They're really materialistic - Seems like they only care about making money; many really don't give a crap about social progress. Heck, my parents only want me to do things that make money and will look good on my resume. Passion? Idealism? Social responsibility? Those are non-existent to them. Some people in my family think that humanitarian efforts are corny and are only useful for making you look good.

6. They're hypocritical, e.g. ""Don't date [insert foreign race here]; they're just after your money!"" But when they find out their daughter has a suitor/their son is dating someone, they go, ""Does s/he come from a rich family?"" If the answer is no, they think, ""S/he's not good enough!""

7. They're too controlling and overprotective of their children, even when said children are already adults. My own parents don't even want me to be commuting because they think the chances of my getting robbed, raped, etc. will increase if I do. Also, I know some parents that have got their kids' lives planned out to the very last detail - note that these kids are in their 20s. In a way, one can infer here that Chinese parents think of their children as investments, meant to take care of them and to do what the parents want them to do. Deviating from what the parents want automatically means that a child is ungrateful and arrogant.

8. They're very distrustful of generally everyone and everything. My parents like to tell me that I shouldn't really have many friends, or even an SO, because I'll never know a person's true self and can thus never fully trust someone. They miss the point that while it's true that no one can ever know another's true self, if one is to be distrustful of everyone, what's the point of socialization or marriage?

9. Herd mentality/shame culture - Chinoy elders are not the least bit shy about meddling in others' affairs. Relatives, and even friends, do it a lot. Say parent A's kid is dating a Pinoy. Parent B thinks it's his/her duty as a friend to tell parent A to his/her face that s/he's not raising the child properly and that the child must be straightened out. As a result, Chinoys are really afraid of what their friends/the community will say. It's frustrating that they seem to value their honor than standing up for what really matters. 

(I'll edit this list when I can think of more things.)

Again, I am not saying that all older Filipino-Chinese are like this. But I find that many of those that I have interacted with exhibit at least one of those traits that I can't stand. I don't know if it's normal to feel this way or if my thinking has already been too Westernized. Outwardly, I try to show my respect to Filipino-Chinese elders because I do acknowledge that their experiences, growing up, have been drastically different from ours. But I feel that respect is a two-way street, so I'm saddened that many of the elders I know cannot seem to respect the changing times and younger people, what with their trying to force their views on others. I envy how most Pinoys and foreigners I know don't experience these things all that much, if at all. One of the few Pinoys I know (not personally) who has to deal with crap like this (if showbiz reports are any indication) is Sarah Geronimo.

I know that my thoughts can be rather unpopular and unpleasant-sounding, but no one really talks much about the flaws of Chinoy society, and I feel that it's time someone started some discussion on this topic. Asian-Americans are more vocal about things like this (interestingly, many of those with first-gen parents have more or less similar experiences) but Pinoys/Chinoys seem rather hesitant to bring this up. Any fellow Chinoys with insights to share? Pinoys and other non-Chinese, I'd love to hear your thoughts as well. 

**Edited to add:** Gave more examples to clarify my points, and added points #8 and 9.

Also, to clarify, there are things I admire about Chinoy society. Specifically, I admire the typical Chinoy work and study ethic, and Chinoys' responsibility when it comes to handling money (i.e. their ability to make money grow). I also do think that it's good that Chinoys generally want their children to be achievers or, at least, more than an average Joe/Jane, provided that they don't take this pursuit to extremes. I also acknowledge that Pinoy culture/society isn't perfect, either, and that some Pinoys are also just as guilty of the things I listed. But I think that those flaws in Pinoys get discussed more often, while Chinoys are usually hailed as a model minority. I started this post partly out of frustration and partly to start some discourse.

I'll reply to your responses tomorrow, but I am trying to do things to distinguish myself from them, e.g. getting involved in humanitarian efforts, but I often get shamed, shot down, and insulted for being different. Years of putting up with this culture has killed my self-esteem, so I can't help but crack at times.

**Thanks for all the replies! I'm surprised that this post got a lot of replies, actually. But some of your responses are rather long, and the things I want to say in response to those might also be just as long, so I'll reply to a few posts at a time, starting with the shorter ones.**"	t5_2qjov	True
1358492666.0	16t0fg	Instead of educating people about Balut by daring them to try it or saying it is like a Viagra, Balut should be presented for what it is, a series of complex textures and flavors. 	anis9	40	13	35	"In Finland they have rotten shark. In Japan they have rotten fish, poisonous blow fish, and rotten tofu. Russia has beluga caviar. France has cheese and truffles. In the Philippines we have our goat cheese, durian, and we certainly have our balut. Cambodia tries to copy but we do it far better than they do.

Things I tell my friends who have never tried it:

1. The broth inside. It's basically a duck and yolk pressure cooked in its own juices, au jus, creating this delicious soup that is full of umami. Slow cooking in the shell makes all of this happen.

2. The yolk is soft and is different from any yolk you've ever tasted. The yolk itself has the essence of duck all over it. 

3. The body or chick, probably what most people hate, is an acquired taste and texture. It's very soft and has small bones. If you ate the eye ball of a fish, chef's say the flavor of that fish is concentrated in that eyeball. Try eating salmon head or bangus head sinigang, the eyes are the best part. Eating the balut chick is similar to eating the eye of a fish. It's gooey, soft, a little boney, but has the concentrated flavor of the duck in such a small thing. When it's more developed, it even has meat in it which makes the proteins taste better.

  If you don't like fish eyes, intestines, lungs, face, tripe, and other innards then you probably will not appreciate these flavors. You should try stuff other than plain meat. Respect the slaughtered animal, use all of it and eat most of it. The flavors and textures are amazing if prepared correctly.

4. The calcium or rock. This is like the ""rice"" of the meal. You take a few bites of this while eating the other textures and flavors. Conio's throw this away, or don't eat balut altogether.

Why do you love or hate balut? :)

I scoured a bit, and found that the articles can be downloaded from their archive. It covers a wide range of topics about the Philippines, mostly cultural and historical. The archive lets you access many of the articles from the first issue in 1953 to issues in the mid-90s. I haven't looked at the ones from late 90s to 2013, as I assumed that most of these aren't open access. If you want to gain a deeper understanding of issues in the Philippines, learn new things about your beloved country, or just want something more academic to read during the summer, I highly recommend this.

I just wanted to find out some of the thoughts and trigger a discussion, because there might be some deeper seeded issues within this situation other than the main/obvious issue (murder).

I am from the Philippines, but have lived abroad for many years so excuse my ignorance if any, but is there an underlying sense of ego between Filipinos? 

I ask this because of a quote in the article that said: ""There was no deeper reason why they attacked the American. Nakalalake lang. (Their egos were just hurt),” Lukban told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.""

I read another comment somewhere, I can't remember where now, but the commenter implied that this situation would have gone down differently if the victim had appeared to be 'more american looking'. 

Or does this not deserve a deeper look into? Are there any social issues in play? Is it just a random occurrence of crime? Who should have the burden of the blame?

I do realize that this particular incident should not be glorified solely because the victim was a foreigner, as there are countless amounts of crime happening to other people with far less or even zero news coverage."	t5_2qjov	True

http://www.rappler.com/nation/28345-ash-explosion-reported-in-mayon

Updates from various sources below. Will organize a little better for your benefit, with oldest updates at the bottom.

EDIT 4: 10am: Sorry for not updating. Needed coffee and newsroom was checking sources. Anyway, last update until we hear more or it gets worse. Conflicting reports of 3 or 4 deaths following the phreatic ash explosion. There are also conflicting reports saying the surviving climbers/mountaineers at Mayon have managed to get to the base camp already. We'll update the above link when we get confirmation of their safety. That said, if another, worse eruption happens, I'll make a new report and keep you folks updated to the best of my ability.  

EDIT 3: 9:05am. ""OCD Bicol says there are around 20 mountain climbers including foreigners on Mt Mayon when Phreatic explosion occured. Injuries reported."" - https://twitter.com/raffytima/status/331575720205766656

Gov. Salceda reporting on TV that they're organizing a rescue team, as there are reported casualties and injuries in Camp 2.


EDIT 2: Phivolcs' Director Solidum has mentioned that there was no magma, and that it's alert level 0.  No jokes about Solidus Snake please. 


EDIT 1: http://www.rappler.com/nation/28345-ash-explosion-reported-in-mayon --- Phreatic ash explosion, according to initial reports. Basically, steam and ash right now. We're hearing reports of casualties, and we're adding onto the report as we're able.


Hey folks. Victor from Rappler here.

I'm trying to get more information on smoke coming out of Mayon Volcano. Phivolcs hasn't mentioned anything, but someone at the area mentioned a large amount of smoke coming out of there. 

https://twitter.com/pinkruffa15/status/331561268441927680

The twitter post mentions an eruption, but we want to make sure. If you have information, please let us know.

We're waiting on word from Phivolcs, though we're hearing reports that it's either an ash explosion or a hydrothermal explosion. Will update here with additional links to Rappler coverage when I am able.

My dads wife is from Manila and they travel over there every couple of years to visit her family. I will be traveling with them on their next trip and am very excited and very nervous. I've never been out of the country, or to a country I know so little about. I'm interested in finding out more about the Filipino culture, and what I can expect when traveling over there. I live in Florida, USA and I imagine its completely different than over there. 

My dad has shown me pictures and his wife Jullah has told me stories about life over there but many of them have been sad. My dad showed me pictures of shacks and project like apartment buildings that people live in. And she has told me stories of poor children begging, and families starving. I'm a little afraid of going over there and seeing poverty like that for the first time. I have two small children so all that is heart breaking for me to hear about. 

What activities and hobbies are most popular over there? What do you recommend I do and try to do while I'm over there? Is there anything I should avoid? What foods should I try?

Edit: I guess I should also add I'll be 24 and I'm a female. Were traveling to other towns/ islands I'm just not sure where. 

Also, if anyone has any tips to get through the flight that'd be great. Were flying from Miami to Houston, TX to Tokyo, Japan to Manila. It's a 27 hour long journey."	t5_2qjov	True

1342149148.0	wha6i	Introducing Prepare Manila, an emergency preparedness site for families in Metro-Manila	anthonylv	30	4	12	"I'd like to introduce you to an emergency preparedness site that I set up: [Prepare Manila](http://preparemanila.org).

It's geared towards ordinary families in Metro-Manila with an aim to give Philippine-centric information on how we can prepare for emergencies.

This means that it's *not* one of those hard core 'end of times' survivalists sites. Rather, I wanted something that would be useful for the little emergencies that we face now, as well as any large-scale disasters that might come up in the future. The [Water storage for condo dwellers](http://preparemanila.org/content/water-storage-condo-dwellers) and [emergency lighting](http://preparemanila.org/content/observations-emergency-lighting-options) articles are examples of this slant.

Another important aspect to the site is that it's geared towards families helping themselves. Much of the discussion in the media focuses on what needs to be done on a governmental level; there's little advice about what we as individuals can do to prepare. 

Further, many resources available online are United States-centric and geared towards the infrastructure of developed counties. Case in point: the [72 hour kit](http://www.redcross.org.ph/feature/72hr-survivalkit) recommended by the Philippine Red Cross. Do they really believe that in the event of a major disaster, we'd get help within 72 hours? During Ondoy, people were waiting for a week or more and when help came, it was in the form of politicians and movie stars trying to get media exposure.

The main message behind the site is basically that we can have a more resilient city by preparing our own households.

So anyways, [here](http://preparemanila.org) it is: http://preparemanila.org

I'd love to hear your feedback on how it can be improved. If you have any questions, post here and I'll try to answer."	t5_2qjov	True

Are there any other sources worth checking out?	gmvancity	25	2	25	"I rate Rappler the most progressive and liberal, Interaksyon as substantive yet conservative, and Inquirer as the most sensational yet with the biggest clout. 

I find the Philippine Star boring. And their website sucks (but is has improved lately).

Manila Bulletin - I don't even bother. 

ABS-CBN / GMA 7 - I somehow don't bother checking their news sites. 

ANC - Sometimes I check their Facebook page. 

Get Real Philippines - Depressing site. All they do is rant and rave against Filipinos. And they seem to be overly hostile to people who disagree with them. They aren't only disagreeing....they're disagreeable. 

Filipino Freethinkers - I like their posts. I get to read them too. You can add them to the mix of new/opinion sites I read. But they're often focused on religion and sexuality issues. 

Of course, I also read international websites and come across Philippine news or opinions about events in the Philippines. 

What other Philippine websites are worth checking out?

Get posting your events at [this little subreddit that's all about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/mnl/)! Anyway, assuming storms don't rule over this weekend, here are a bunch of things to check out.

[Cinemalaya 9 @ CCP, Trinoma, Greenbelt 3, and Alabang Town Center, until August 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/mnl/comments/1io4cw/film_cinemalaya_9_ccp_trinoma_greenbelt_3_and/) - Hey guys, we have an indie film scene. Let's support it. And you want to see some PORNO right? (Seriously don't know why anyone would pick that for a film title. Try googling your film now...)

[SYNERGY SESSIONS - Fire, Flow Arts &amp; Drum Community Gathering @ Venice Piazza, Aug 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/mnl/comments/1iycsf/multi_synergy_sessions_fire_flow_arts_drum/) - This is confusing coz the promos say ""Aug 30"" but I think it's happening on Fri. The Flow Arts Facebook page certainly thinks so.

[Makikitawag Lang Ako @ PUP Theater, Aug 1-3](http://www.reddit.com/r/mnl/comments/1jh9q9/theater_makikitawag_lang_ako_pup_theater_aug_13/) - A play based on a Gabriel Garcia Marquez story. I haven't read it. I assume it's about Garcia Marquez's cellphone running low on juice, forcing him to ask a stranger if he can borrow his phone.

There is a long-winding and dramatic story behind everything, and I'm not sure where to begin other than what's going at the moment.

Long story short, my Mother has been doing a long streak of questionable decisions and behavior ranging from placing the blame on her financial debts towards my father, myself and my siblings to her condoning her horrible Egyptian online ""boyfriend"" (who admittedly only wants online booty) asking my then 8 year old sister to show her legs and the rest of her body on camera.

As protective measure, I've become admittedly hostile towards her and kicked her out of the house. My sisters don't feel safe around her but allow her to visit because according to them, ""ayaw nila saktan ni mommy si ate at ung ibang tao sa bahay"". 

This has gone on for 4 years. Now, she's threatening to burn the house down and she was outside the house earlier talking to her druggie brother on the phone. We suspect they're planning something devious against the family, and we're not comfortable.

All of them are allowed to stay a maximum of five (5) days in the pound before being terminated using the gas chamber. At first, we tried to have them adopted in a weekly basis. But since we cannot keep up with the numbers of the dogs being impounded everyday and are scheduled to be put to sleep every Friday, we have come up with an idea to house them to be rehabilitated and treated before being put up for adoption. Since all rescue shelters are currently full and they refused to take in any more dogs, we decided to build a new place for the dogs to stay. We have lost a lot of dogs already because the pound is not conducive for them to recuperate especially for the sickly ones. Their health is rapidly declining. Even some of the healthier ones died already from insufficient food and from transmittable diseases.
In line with this, we need to raise at least Php150,000 (approximately USD3,600) for the construction materials and other needs of the 53 dogs. A good samaritan has offered us to use a portion of her unused farm to house all the dogs for free. We are humbly asking anyone who would like to share their blessings to help these poor souls.  Any amount will make these dogs happy no matter how small it is. We have been spending our personal money to send some of them to our private vet. But we don't have enough for the construction of their temporary home. We will be documenting everything to show that the money will be used accordingly.

You probably remember me from [my post on what I perceive to be the ills of Chinoy society](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17p7rn/25f_im_a_filipino_chinese_based_in_the/). Well, I'm now going to share more of my personal experiences. It's driving me insane, and, while I've gotten a bit more desensitized to the point that I don't cry in front of my folks anymore, it still doesn't mean I'm okay.



I'll try my best to do this without revealing as many personal details as possible, lest they find this thread. If anyone could lend an ear, could I send you a PM when I find the time? Work is keeping me busy, so I might not be able to reply as often, though.



Anyway, here goes. I'll try to make headings to make things easier to read. Take note, the relatives mentioned here are the relatives on my dad's side.


**Background** 


I'm the oldest child, and I'm female. My mom's side is more well-adjusted. My dad's side, though, is overbearing and controlling. My dad grew up with a domineering mother, and all of his siblings grew up basically being brainwashed by their mother, and thinking that the way they were raised and their relationship with one another (they're overly attached, such that only my dad got married) is the hallmark of a healthy, respectful, traditional Chinese family, Even though my dad's married, they think they have a say in our lives. It really does not help that they are uber-conservative and don't go out often. Other than working (for the family business), they don't have much of a life, so they really are very socially awkward and unaware of social conventions other than the extremely rigid Fil-Chi social conventions. Worse, my dad lets them have their say (which also upsets my mom sometimes) because he thinks that that's what ""kapatiran"" and familial love are all about. They're all too attached to one another. 


Since I was the first child to be born to their side, of course, they all doted on me. I was an achiever in school. Being the first child, my parents and relatives weren't sure what to expect from me, but I exceeded their expectations. Since I was shy and quiet, and I got good grades, they always saw me as a model child. I thought that they'd eventually be less overprotective and trust me more. Boy, was I wrong.



**After college and until now**



To sum up our clashes, the folks and relatives are highly traditional, and they believe that they already know very well how the world works, refusing to believe that maybe they don't know as much as they think they do. They believe that the traditional Chinese way is the best and only way to live life.



I graduated from college with good grades (and honors, even) and without getting into trouble (didn't do drugs, drink, smoke, or party - I have a bit of a dirty mind thanks to some of the things I've read, but that's about it). But my folks didn't cut me any slack.



Just now, I made this post because my dad went ballistic on me again today. This is the nth time he's done that. The last time he did that this year was in January, when I made the aforementioned post I linked to. Before that, there were several other times in the past few years. No matter how much I plead for him to talk calmly and to talk to me like an equal, nothing happens, because he insists that I'm a child.



This would be even longer than it should if I were to list all the BS he's given me, so I'll just list the noteworthy ones/whatever I can remember.



* Despite generally being a good kid, I'm still an embarrassment to him because I'm not obedient. Because I dare to have non-Chinese friends and actually enjoy their company, and, worse, have a non-Chinese BF whom I truly love, I am an embarrassment, never mind what I've achieved in school and at work.



* He cannot accept that I have different views, because he says that we should follow the traditional Chinese set-up, in which there is a hierarchy in a family, and everyone answers to only one boss, which is him.



* I said that just because I make decisions that he doesn't like (and they're not even glaringly bad/evil decisions - I just dared to have non-Chinese friends and a non-Chinese BF, and engage in hobbies that he doesn't find productive, e.g. writing), it doesn't mean we can't love or respect each other. He said that he knows that, but who cares about that? I should just listen to him, **because.** 



* He said that there are many things I can't achieve in life because I'm Chinese and I'm a woman, so I should just put up with it and shut up. As far as he's concerned, women can stay in the kitchen, unless money-making is involved (which is why he keeps pushing me towards money-making industries even though he knows where I can truly flourish). He often belittles my mom and says he doesn't have to listen to her all the time because she's not the head of the household, and that doing this is okay because it's part of the Fil-Chi tradition. (And sadly, it really is, for many traditional households. Worse, my mom doesn't have much of a problem with that treatment. Both parents are of the opinion that you don't need love to make a marriage work. As long as you have a lot of food, clothing, shelter, and money, you can force yourself to be happy. In relation to that, my BF isn't poor but he isn't filthy rich, so he's not good enough for them.)



* I said that while I'm not a radical feminist, I cannot agree with that. My parents' marriage, and my relatives' actions, are what actually made me realize that I do not want to marry a Chinoy. I know that the younger generation is generally better, but if I will have to put up with relatives who think and act like my folks and relatives, I will just go insane. Dad said that my line of thinking is wrong and selfish, not to mention symptomatic of the ills of today's generation (he thinks individualism = selfishness).



* I have been threatened with disownment since January 2013. My dad hasn't actually done it, but he says he eventually will, if I don't become obedient. And he says that I better be successful if he kicks me out, because if I suffer humiliation and persecution, I was asking for it. He said he doesn't believe in unconditional love (despite seeming to want me to unconditionally love him), and that he won't take me back if I stumble. It scared me a bit, but right now, I feel motivated to accept his challenge and be successful if he does kick me out (and even if he doesn't, I want to be successful for my own sake, and to prove him wrong).



* In relation to being successful, he disapproves of my hobbies and interests. He is pissed that the masteral program I'm about to take isn't an MBA. (Again, I will elaborate in a PM. If I disclose the details, I'll be giving away my identity.) He says I'll only be successful if I listen to him. In his words (I kid you not), ""I may make mistakes sometimes, but I always know best!"" (It's a sentiment that mom echoes sometimes.) He equates success with being filthy rich, and he doesn't care that I'm okay with not being filthy rich. What's important to me is to live a middle- to upper middle-class lifestyle, and with my finances and current job, I know that I can do it. Even with some other job with a lower pay, I think I can do it because I can live within my means. But no; I'm not successful if I'm not making big money.



* Dad has been emotionally manipulating me. The relatives don't know about the BF yet, but I can imagine that their reaction will be something like my dad's. Dad keeps saying, ""Are you going to turn your back on the people who have taken care of and loved you for the 20-something years of your life for a man you've only known for a few years?"" I keep saying that that's not the case, and that he shouldn't see it that way, but he insists on seeing it that way. (On a related note, he even used Heart Evangelista and Sarah Geronimo as examples, the former being a bad daughter and the latter being a good daughter for him.)



* The relatives have already shown that they're only capable of being happy for me and loving me if it doesn't take too much effort. They love giving me material things, and that apparently already means that they love me a lot. To my face, they say they are supportive of me. But a maid who works for them said that they're actually not happy about my career plans (studying/working abroad) because of superficial worries, mainly, possibly bringing home a foreign husband.



* The only people my dad and relatives see as valid source of advice/opinions are people who think like them. In short, they're surrounded by assholes, but they can't seem to realize it. (Or maybe they don't want to.) They also keep saying that if I marry a non-Chinese, not only will I be ostracized, but they will also be ostracized. 



* The shame and humiliation they say they'll get from these people is why my dad says he will someday disown me if I toe the line too much. So in short, their pride is more important than their love for me. It's just frustrating that they don't realize that people who shame you for making choices they deem unacceptable are people not worth hanging around in the first place.



* With the help of a tattletale sibling who's on their side, they sometimes try to break into my social networking accounts to find out what I'm up to. I've learned my lesson, and I now keep changing passwords, but there were times when - sorry, my fault - I got negligent and slipped up. They've dug up chat logs with my BF. In some of them, I was making dirty in-jokes with him, which offended them, and, in others, I was ranting about them. I was using rather colorful language, but my BF kept making jokes and innocuous comments to diffuse my anger. (Sorry, I can get rather emotional when I'm pissed, but I at least just restrict such posts or chats to a certain few people.)They keep saying that I have no right to vent about them. I should just keep quiet and suck it in, and quit being disrespectful. I'm sorry; I'm aware that venting can be rather disrespectful, but if I don't vent, I really will go insane with the things they do and say. I need emotional support, too, and if my family can't give it to me, then of course I need to seek support from others. Previously, in high school and college, before I met my BF, I'd rant on a locked blog (which isn't enough for me these days; it's just too one-sided - no one is there to listen), with some entries being private to me. But they took offense even to that! Said sibling is also threatening to blackmail me by making such posts public if I cross a line. That sibling also watches me like a hawk when I have arguments with the folks, in case I might talk to someone about stuff. (Take note, this is a younger sibling but she's acting like the cultural police!) Too bad for her; I still try to find ways to vent.




* The weirdest thing: they keep thinking that going to church will help fix my ills and make me a better person. Ironically, neither of my parents is religious. My relatives go to church but then they espouse self-righteous beliefs. They're also convinced that Christians are better people than non-Christians. They still keep insisting that if I go to church, I will meet the right people - better people than the people I keep as company, even. I'm not an atheist; I'm just a non-practicing Catholic (I think Jesus is awesome, but many of his followers these days just ruin things for everyone). But if I'm to start going to church, I'd rather go to church with people who aren't religious hypocrites. Just this morning, they kept bugging me to go, and even threatened to ground me and put me under house arrest if I refused to go.



I just don't really know how to deal with them anymore. I'm at my wits' end. I just try not to think about these things often, especially since it's not every day that they pull off crap like this. Still, during the days that everything is calm, I feel that it's an uneasy peace - that there's no telling when they'll blow up again and take offense to this or that. I don't get why I'm the bad daughter just because I'm more individualistic and I know what I want in life. Meanwhile, my siblings who can't think or decide for themselves (tattletale sibling's already in college yet always has to consult my folks for decisions) are praised for being better siblings because they're more obedient. As my dad said, ""You may be mellow and kind-hearted, but you're still not a good daughter and you're a disappointment because you're not obedient.""



I wish I could move out but they really won't let me do it. Moving out is really easier said than done in the Philippines, isn't it? Even my Pinoy friends say that their parents would not take a desire to move out well. My best bet is the masteral program abroad, but I don't want to live abroad forever. It may be chaotic here, but I want to return. I'd like to think that after a few years abroad, my relationship with the folks might improve, but the way things just seem to keep getting worse... I don't know.



What advice can you give to me? Are there any psychologists, counselors or life coaches whom I can talk to? I've looked around a few times, but the fees are a bit too expensive for me. I technically have the funds but I'd like to save my money for other things. I've got a priest friend who counsels me (and in a non-preachy way, too!), but I don't get to see him all that often because he lives far away and is busy. And I can't keep bugging my friends about this all the time because it'll just stress them out.



Your insights will be much appreciated! Also, I might cross-post this to Asian Parent Stories.

This will stop people from padding their sponsors with politicians and discourage the ""patronage"" system fostered by the abuse of the ninong-ninang system."	gmvancity	28	10	12	"I no longer live in Manila. But I find it sickening to see in the newspapers or in churches a newly wed couple getting 12 pairs of sponsors, 10 pairs of which are politicians who they hardly know and a bunch of famous actors/actresses. 

For example, isn't it sickening to see a sponsor list composed of a former president, a current vice president, 3 senators, 3 congressmen, and a sprinkling of other local officials and a b-movie star. 

If the Catholic Church, which claims to have 85% of the population as part of their religion, wants to be a pro-active and positive force towards cultural and systemic change in the Philippines, it can probably do the future generations a big favor by not encouraging this patronage system and instead help revive the true significance of a ""sponsor"" to a wedding, baptism, or confirmation. 

Right now, as it stands, this whole sponsorship thing in the catholic church makes a mockery of the true meaning of a ""sponsor"" (someone who will be a true guide, a role model, someone who will take care of your kids, etc.) and indirectly contributes to the padrino/padrina/patronage politics in the Philippines.

Kasi, ang break namin sa school here in the US is only 7 days tapos may 10 day wating period daw sa Filipino marriage certificate. We can only be in the Philippines for a total of 7 days. Possible ba na makakakuha kami ng marriage certificate sa loob ng 7 days? 

As a side note, bakit ang komplikado ng kasal sa pinas? I just want our families to be together on our special day.

TL;DR - Is it possible to obtain a marriage certificate in the Philippines in under 10 days?

EDIT: thanks for all of your advice. It seems that obtaining the proper paperwork in under 10 days is near impossible. I have been in contact with my fiance's family and have been relaying this information to them. We will keep investigating further and make necessary adjustments. 

We *would* just get married in the U.S. but my fiance's father cannot leave his work to come to the U.S. and it is very important to both of us that my family and her family be together on our wedding day.

I go to America fairly often to visit family, but I've lived all my life in the Philippines before this. When we moved, I thought it was just another family vacation, then my parents dropped the bomb on me. 

I was genuinely confused and angry, since I had no idea we were staying here for good. I didn't even get to have a proper goodbye to my high school friends, and suddenly I was going to start high school all over again, in America of all places! The teen angst faded after a few months, but I was really proud to be Filipino. Everyone couldn't believe I came straight from the Philippines, because I didn't have the heavy fob accent. It was a really awkward transition socially, because cultural norms here and there are prominently different. But if there's one thing I made sure you knew, it's that I was Filipino.

Then, I met a couple of Filipino-Americans. This was an eye-opening moment for me since I thought ""Oh, they are Filipino just like me. They will surely know where I'm coming from. We will get along just fine"". 

But it was far from it. They didn't know at all. They were sheltered. They grew up here. They couldn't relate to my experiences. What really irked me was how they were proud to be Filipino. I couldn't process how you could claim to be Filipino without knowing how to speak Tagalog. How could you be Filipino when you haven't even been there? Do you know how deep of a meaning the word ""barkada"" has and how it simply just isn't your friends? Sure, you might be surrounded and raised in Filipino culture, but you grew up in America. You are sheltered. This sounds elitist, but you don't know what it really is to be Filipino. You are Filipino-American.

So I came to resent Filipino-Americans. I can't explain it but it's some sort of secret club mentality. I always view them as an outsider from our culture no matter how hard they try to assimilate and learn every single detail. Unless you grew up in the Philippines, to me, you are not truly Filipino.

Even though I grew up in the Philippines, the following years here have turned me into a completely different person. Like I said earlier, the differences between cultural norms are like night and day. Everyone is more independent. Approaching girls is now a different ball game. The average American teen is a lot more adventurous. People have a casual attitude towards sex. Need I say drugs? I feel that all this contributed greatly to how I grew up as an adult compared to if I were have just lived there. When I moved here, I had a vision of how I'd turn out to be. If I were to come face to face with that kid, he probably won't identify with me at all, let alone recognize me. After graduating from university and doing all sorts of crazy shit I never would've done, I came to realize how America has warped my outlook on life. My years and experiences here have shaped me into who I am today, and I would never trade it for anything. Not even to go back in time and stay in the Philippines.

Which brings me to my problem - I do not identify with anyone. 

I am not American. Even though I am a citizen, I did not grow up here. I watched a lot of American TV shows and movies, but I didn't have the experience of being one. I didn't take that yellow school bus to school. My schools didn't have nice cafeterias like yours. I didn't know what it was like to be a boy scout. My high school life was not the same as yours. I wasn't raised the same way you were.

I am not Filipino-American. You have an idea of my culture, but that's just it – an idea. You merely adopted the culture. I was born in it.

The hardest part for me to accept is my attitude towards Filipinos, especially those in the Philippines. Filipinos have some of the most negative, backwards, and antagonistic attitude towards life in general. A lot of people do not realize their capacity to think for themselves and break the norm. The general outlook is “People around me do this, therefore I will do the same. Bahala na si batman”. An example of this would be the recent controversy with the RH bill. If I grew up in the Philippines, I know for a fact that I would actually support that bill. But after living here, it's quite clear that voting no on this means you are a citizen who does not want progress in your country. Everyone drags everyone else down, no one likes to see his neighbor doing better than him. Especially here in America. A lot of fellow Filipinos will praise you if you are a self-made man, but for some reason scorn you for ""putting on airs"". “Ang yabang naman nyan, kala mo kung ano pumorma, galing din naman sa pinas”. If I worked for my money, am I not entitled to how I spend it? What does it matter to you? Am I obligated to help you out and give money to every single Filipino I see? You are on Reddit, so I assume you are at least familiar with how different the average internet poster is compared to the Filipinos who only visit Facebook/Friendster/whatever is popular. I haven't talked to my friends in the Philippines in years but I guarantee that if we were to meet today, we would not see eye-to-eye on a lot of things. I imagine hanging out with them would be weird, since we have nothing to relate with each other except the early hayskul days.

Nowadays, when people ask me what ethnicity I am, I say I'm half-Chinese half-Filipino, only because I have a Chinese last name. I don't even get excited like I used to when I meet someone who's actually from the Philippines. Sometimes I even feel embarrassed. If I know you speak both English and Tagalog, I'd rather talk to you in English.

This will probably get a lot of hate, but I just wanted to see if anyone out there feels the same. I know this is poorly written, but this is the first time where I actually tried to put these feelings into writing. Don't really feel like fleshing it out. I've felt this way for a long time now and I'm wondering if feeling this way about your people is irrational.

A Filipina could be racially classified as a Negroid if they are descended from the original Negrito natives of the islands.  If they are descended from the majority Malay population that arrived later, then they would be classified as an Austronesian.  Yet if they are descended from even later Chinese inhabitants, they would be Mongoloid; or from Spanish arrivals, they would be Caucasoid.  Without further clarification, a Filipina could be any of the four racial classifications, or any combination thereof.  

Ultimately race is a 19th century European pseudo-science that sought to dehumanize foreign groups and legitimize their repression.  To continue to speak in terms of race is akin to addressing medical conditions in terms of the four humors.  That being said, art dealing with identity is a major segment of contemporary art production, so if we are going to talk in terms of race, at least let's get it right and not conflate racial identity with national, cultural, ethnic, or linguistic identities."" - Garbanzo

But it seemed a little off. Only heard some men yelling for a few seconds, but the woman screaming was for at least 5 minutes. I really couldn't keep track of time. We called the police station to report it, but we didn't have any other information except where we were and that we heard a woman screaming. He didn't ask too much information from us, so who knows? She wasn't screaming for help, just screaming. The last time I heard short screams like that, that just repeated over and over was when my neighbor's dog got run over in front of her. It sounds fake, but it registers later that it's complete terror.

We heard a siren go by a few minutes after we made the call. Not sure where the sound came from (within the hotel or nextdoor). What else can we do? Don't really want to venture outside to look, and we tried calling the hotel number but it's just the office number, no mobile.

We don't hear anything anymore now-- it's probably been half an hour since it all started. At the very worst, I'm thinking rape or murder. At the very least, maybe a bad traffic accident?

We were just too scared to go outside because it was dark/no lights outside. We couldn't see the guard from where we were staying. I walked over to where I heard the sounds and saw a pool of dark red brown in the dirt. Maybe it's some other liquid like oil, but maybe it was blood.

KontraBulate	29	12	43	"One thing that has really bothered me since I came to the Philippines is that it seems filipinos are always looking for handouts. This may be part of the culture but it seems my office mates are always looking for someone to treat them to food. I know it is common to treat other on your birthday here but they are not shy about asking or expecting to receive something. Even if it is not someone birthday but they received some extra money for a promotion or whatever it may be it seems they think they are entitled to some part of it.

I am an American living in the Philippines for about the past two years and have a girlfriend here in the Philippines. Whenever I fly back to the states I am constantly asked for pasalubong. from my officemates, my gfs officemates, my gfs friends. Why does everyone expect something from me, people that I wouldn't even consider friends?

In another instance my gfs family also expects alot from her because she is dating me. She has helped them financially and I also understand that is part of the culture, but they expect her to pay for laptop, iPad, etc (non necessary items) for her sister. Recently her dad asked her if I would sponsor his futbol team. Why? I don't know because I don't have a business. They think I am very well off, which I am not, but even if I was I don't think I should be expected to give them money. 

Don't get me wrong I love the country and the people but this has started to bother me more and more and has just been awkward for me. It also scares me that my gfs family will be taking much of her salary so she will not be able to save for her/our future. Does anyone else have experience with this?

If she doesn't pay, they take the chair back. Help me investigate this?	anis9	22	5	18	"**FINAL**: I called their bluff. ""We don't want the chair and we dont want to pay you anything."" The store said we can keep the free chair and not need to pay 10 grand. I asked about their permits and BIR stuff and I guess that scared em.

--------------------------------------------------

**Update2:** Wife going back to the store now. We both agreed to not sign anything and give any personal info. 
She says if she's forced to sign, she'll use a fake signature. Is that ok to do?

----------------------------------------------

**Update:** We called the salesperson who gave us the chair. We said we refuse to pay. They said that's fine but just come to the store tomorrow to cancel the promo. I told my wife not to sign anything. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

The massage chair and store is one of those massage products stores. They are usually Japanese or Korean and have massage chairs you can try. 

They gave my wife this massage chair.

http://www.sulit.com.ph/index.php/classifieds+directory/q/colvern+venco+massage+chair

and told her to pay 10 thousand tomorrow to claim the rest of the appliances. A foot massager, a small stove, kitchen utensils, etc. She was also told not to say she won this in a prize but chose to buy from the store to promote the store. 

Weird stuff right? 

Like you, I found this all shady and my wife did too. So I did my research and this company doesn't have an official site. I also noticed that there are so many people on sulit selling the exact same chair I have. In the description they won it in the exact same way as well. 

Now, here's my theory. This is a really sneaky way to get you to buy something you don't want. They tell you you won and ask you to pay. You really get legit items, that are probably all worth 10,000 pesos, but wouldn't have thought of purchasing them without the ""you win a prize"" sales strategy. 

""hey sir wanna buy a massage chair, an electric stove, and foot massager for 10 grand?"" 

""no""

""hey sir you won a chair worth 100,000 pesos!""

""what really! Yeah!""

""Yes, and to claim it and more prizes like appliances, just pay 10,000""

I'm trying to give some college advice to my niece, and I was thinking it would be helpful if they have more information about the various career paths for whatever course they decide to take on college.

I can only give examples based on my experience and some of my friends and relatives. If some of you guys can put your educ+job experience or some of the people you know, we can create a bigger picture of the various possibilities for different college degrees!

Shared Spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnevhsqBNJoudElfX2xCSElFTGNHRWFKUGhOaW52ZWc&amp;usp=sharing

How to update the spreadsheet (Est. Time: 3 minutes):

1) Name-Initials : You only need to enter the initials of your/your friend's name. 

2) Education Info:  

Academic Competency - Write Average/Good based on the marks received during college. Excellent is only for the graduates with honors or board top notchers. Bad is for those who were just lucky to graduate.

School is optional info. Year Graduated is required.

3) Jobs from Year 1 to 10 after graduation: Generic job titles please. Junior Draftsman &amp; Senior Draftsman can just be submitted as 'Drafstman'.

4) Job Misc Info: Indicate monthly earnings (Annual Earning/13mos.), and if current job is based abroad.

5) Remarks: can be about educ or job info. It can be also an explanation if there are years without work. 

A few redditors' participation will be awesome, I'm not really expecting much (20 updates is already ambitious!) So if you have a few minutes to give, just add more info of any of your friends so we can come up with richer information :) And if I can be a little more ambitious, I'd wish we can get like 30+ different career paths for 20 different courses, and with more additional info, and I could share the info to the school of my niece which they can use for career counseling.

This is a publicly shared document. Any kind of information that we will ultimately collect can be used by anyone for whatever purpose.

example: 

-leaving your trash on the table after eating at mcdonalds

-leaving tips.

-picking at your teeth to get stuck food out; while, at the table.

Those are only a few that I can think of right now... they don't have to be related to table etiquette. 

So what kind of things are frowned on and what type of practices are normal in Philippine culture? I am a Canadian btw.

Thanks!

What can I do?	anis9	21	4	37	"**Update 3:** I asked the supervisor at Globe who they forward tech complaints to. They said they ff it to a 3rd party contractor repair group called Teleservice. Globe wont give me any info on them. They said that it all has to be done using their useless system. I googled and called Teleservice. They looked for my case and they said they couldn't fix it themselves. They escalated it to another group who handles stolen/broken cables. MDTS or Md Tambungui Specialists. It turns out they already told MDTS to replace the cables over a month ago but nothing was done. I'm going to find MDTS' info and give them a call tomorrow. I'm having more progress and getting more answers by doing the work myself instead of relying on Globe to do it for me. What a mess of a system they have. I've been told there are no more escalation teams higher than MDTS so if there is a one month delay, it is probably MDTS' fault. Will find out tom.

**Update 2:** I was at the box. No one showed up at the facility/distribution point to fix anything today, contrary to what I was told.

**Update:** Their new response to me saying ""I've contacted NTC and DTI to complain. Please explain why you don't have replacement cables ready for broken lines and why this took 1 month."" is -
""We're now fixing the problem. We have dispatched repairmen."" Fucking assholes going around the question. I'm heading to the box where they plan to fix the wires. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Our Globe internet has been down for close to a month. I've called tech support 25 times and they say that the escalation team says ""There were cables stolen and we don't know when we can restore service."" They shouldn't have offered service if they don't have provisions to replace cables, stolen or broken. This is a nightmare for home business owners like myself.

I've tried going to business centers, calling 211, talked to dozens of supervisors. They are as frustrated as I am. 

They would send an escalation email to the tech team supervisors asking ""Sirs, when will you replace the cables? Why aren't you ready with replacement cables? 3 entire homeowners associations are down. Businesses are affected and are losing money because of this. Why?""

Their only reply, every time out of 50 emails sent by supervisors, is always ""Please tell customer to wait. Network restoration and cable replacement ongoing"" I would ask the supervisors (for a whole month now, almost daily) to email them and demand a real explanation, a timetable, and they would ignore.

Here's the thing. I know where the main distribution/facility (where the said cables are stolen or being fixed) point is. I have friends who check on the area regularly and they tell me that no van or globe repair has come to even survey the place. I have reason to believe that laziness and complacency is the main reason we don't have internet for a month. I now have a petition signed by our village to complain.

I'm tired as fuck. How do I get these people in trouble for being unprofessional and not having a timetable for a solution. Everyday they delay, my business loses thousands. We have a wireless backup but its crap. We're from Dasmarinias, Cavite.

I have a home business that's losing money daily because of their incompetence. No one is accountable. They hide behind CSR's and emails and generic responses. I've had enough but they are the only available internet service in the area.

Do you guys know where I can find a physical address for the Globe Dasma branch? Not the business center in the mall but the actual office where the vans come from. I plan to complain there and bring my list of signatures from hundreds of people.

I fully understand that the phone CSR's are there to receive complaints and document them. The supervisors are there to escalate. The problem isn't with the people answering the phones, everything is documented and escalated, it's with the people who actually need to physically fix the issue. They are not doing anything and explaining anything even to their own Globe supervisors. Any idea what else I can do? "	t5_2qjov	True

It started with everyday terms that just didn't sound Tagalog, so I figured they were corrupted English words. Some were easy, like ""**pambot**"" (pump boat), ""**aprub**"", (approve) and ""**taplod**"" (the roof of the jeepney where passengers got on if the inside was already full --&gt; top load). I was a kid when I started doing this.

One thing that I couldn't figure out was ""**apir**"". I thought it came from *appear*, like the sound of a clap when a magician suddenly appears out of thin air. After many years, the solution came from Barney Stinson, of all people. I was watching a scene in HIMYM where he was trying to get high fives, and he said, ""Up here!"" and ""Down low!"" That was just a eureka moment for me: **UP HERE --&gt; apir**. I was more excited than I probably should have been.

**TL;DR**: I was a weird kid who spent waaay too much time thinking about words. I still haven't grown out of it. Tell me I'm not alone.

**EDIT:** I haven't figured out ""**tepok**"" (dead) yet. Also, ""**dedma**"" (to ignore, be nonchalant).

Well, there are plenty of things which prove that but the only reason this would need to be declared ""proven"" in such an indignant and defensive way is if the average Filipino believed his/her ancestors were culture-less primitives in need of civilizing.

A little background about myself: I'm an American studying anthropology and history. I try to read whatever I can about the history of the Philippines, both the pre-Hispanic and later periods. One book I've read, [*Sinaunang Habi*](http://www.amazon.com/Sinaunang-Habi-Philippine-Ancestral-Filipiniana/dp/9718792007/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376337651&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sinaunang+habi), makes a similar point to the one I've seen in various comments sections before. The author states that her work studying indigenous clothing strives to disprove the apparently popular belief that the pre-Hispanic Filipinos were ""naked, dirty and illiterate"".

Now it's very obvious for me as someone who has access to historical records from the Spanish era and beyond that this belief is false. Not only did many indigenous Filipino groups wear very intricate clothing (many still do), but they bathed more often than the Spanish and those groups with their own written languages were noted for being highly literate by the admission of Spanish priests. Incidentally, some of these same Spanish priests helped make records of scripts like Baybayin and used it to translate religious tracts into Tagalog, including [*Doctrina Christiana*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16119/16119-h/16119-h.htm) in 1593. This is also similar to what the Jesuits did in Mexico from the mid 1500's until they were expelled from New Spain (Philippines, Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America) by order of the King of Spain for apparently growing too close to the indigenous populations and threatening colonial loyalty to the Crown.

tl;dr I don't know what the situation in schools now is like because I'm a foreigner but the historical evidence points towards a very ""civilized"" (assuming that term actually has meaning in a comparative sense) pre-Hispanic Filipino population, and to lead students to believe otherwise would be a shame and an outright lie.

I was walking home on Makati Ave. around 3AM when a homeless looking man seemed to purposely walk into me. He dropped a bag of ""food"" he was carrying and started yelling about it being for his family and insisting on giving him money. Although I'm almost positive he did this purposely I was kind of scared (he had crazy eyes and was pretty frantic) so I think I gave him a 100 spot. I checked out the food he dropped and it just looked like some dirty rice.

Another time, I got in a cab (again very early in the morning), only for the driver to tell me he was having engine problems and he couldn't take me to my destination. When I tried to get out of the cab both of the back doors seemed to be child locked (locked so they can only be opened from the outside). The driver kept insisting that I pull the handle and push on the door. Eventually I insisted that he open the door from the outside of the car. I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but it really had me startled, like I was completely helpless stuck in the back of the car. Was he trying to distract me by having me open the door so he could snatch my wallet? or hoping that I broke the handle so I'd give him money. Like I said this really had me startled so I couldn't stop thinking about what was going on.

Has anyone else encountered scams like this?"	t5_2qjov	True

I'm Chinese by ethnicity but I grew up in the Philippines. I've been pretty involved in community service and I love the Philippines a lot. I consider myself Filipino by nationality (even if I'm a US citizen)

I went to the US to study for college. I decided to check out the Philippine Student Association to find familiar space. To my disappointment, it was full of Filipino Americans. Noone really spoke Tagalog. They sometimes would make fun of Filipino culture (in a lighthearted way). It annoyed me when they would claim to be Filipino. People would start thinking ""Oh. This is what a Filipino is"". I, however, felt no association with them. I would consider their parents Filipino but I'd consider them Filipino American. I don't think it's right for them to call themselves Filipino when they are so detached from what's happening in the country. They have a culture of their own.

I'm going back this summer for a vacation without my parents. So it will be so awkward since I might not recognize half of my family since there are a lot of newborn cousins that I never met yet.

I can hardly speak Tagalog now without making a fool of myself, so I guess I will most likely speak English to all the people who I meet.

Besides the sweltering heat, what should I expect going back to the Philippines?

Like for example... what should I not do or what should I do when I meet my relatives? 

Also do people in restaurants and fast-food places talk English? Since it will be awkward for them to take my order and not understanding.

I'm just a little worried since I remember going back when I was 6 years old and needing to go to the ""washroom""(As they call it here in Canada). Anyways my parents saw this security guard and figured that he would know, so they told me to ask him.

To my horror, he had a confused face and said, ""Anong washroom?"" or something along those lines. So I had to act out as if I were peeing so he could get the message. He said, ""Ahhhhh CR.... CR!"" and pointed me at the right direction.

Then to my demise, for some reason, we had to pay separately depending if we wanted to pee or poo and I didn't know what to tell them.

Besides all of this, I'm looking forward to go to Philippines since I miss most of my relatives that I do know!

For example, adding ""kindly"" to a request, ""Would you kindly do this?"". This just isn't used at all in the states and yet you hear it all time in the Philippines. I cringe whenever I hear this or see it used in an email. 

Another would be the use of ""for a while"". Americans use this phrase to signify a lengthy stretch of time, ""I'm going to be away for a while"". However, I always hear it used for a short period of time in the Philippines, as in ""Can I borrow your pen for a while?"", instead of, ""Can I borrow your pen for a little bit?"", or ""Can I borrow that real quick?"". 

Am I just being anal? Or is it just that certain countries take English and use it in different ways?

EDIT: I never said Filipino English is wrong. And don't bother analyzing my grammar as I'm referring to spoken English. When I learned Tagalog, I learned it the way that Filipinos use it in order to be understood more clearly. Filipinos interact with Americans all the time. What's wrong with them learning how Americans use certain phrases and adopting the same usage?"	t5_2qjov	True
1349319068.0	10wxyv	Section 26 of Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution	theyawner	18	2	3	"Has nothing to do with the cybercrime law. Sorry. But what it does state is that: 
&gt;""The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and **prohibit political dynasties** as may be defined by law.""

Funny that after more than two decades, the bicameral congress has yet to pass an anti-dynasty law. No surprise there, since that would mean political suicide for the majority of these politicians. But there still are recent attempts; one by Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago, and the other by Cong. Teddy Casiño.

* Senate Bill No 2649 - An Act to Prohibit the Establishment of Political Dynasties ([link](http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=15&amp;q=SBN-2649))
* House Bill No 3413 - An Act Prohibiting the Establishment of Political Dynasties ([direct pdf link](http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/basic_15/HB03413.pdf))

The bills are not perfect in that they both contain compromises, in the form of limiting dynasties by just city and/or province. Still, the chances of this proposals getting passed is hairline slim. And with the upcoming elections and news of the next gen candidates, perhaps none at all.

I start at home. I talk to my younger siblings about safe sex (because our parents and their school do not wish to talk about it), and discuss it openly. I shared my experience in getting a test, and taught them the ABCs. I assured them that they can talk to me in any way they want to regarding anything (esp sex), without judgement. Even offered to buy them condoms. 

I told my sister that in the event that sex presents itself, she has a total say in the decision. if any one of them says no, its a no go. Otherwise, if they both agree, then practice safe sex. She also has the risk of getting pregnant so it is really important that she knows this as early as 15.

Filipinos can find pride in anything and as annoying as it is on social media sites, I would very much rather have fellow filipinos see the good in common news rather than see everything as a ""disgrace"" or ""full of shit"".

This is extremely depressing.  The amount of self hate that I read everyday in this subreddit doesn't make this subreddit any better, and it doesn't make the Philippines any better at all.  Be the change.  Quit calling bullshit on everything going on in the Philippines and actually think of it in different perspectives.  Adapt a subjective mind.  Oh, such-and-such copied this?  They saw it as a good idea and incorporated it.  Quit taking it so personally.  Have some pride that they actually stepped outside of the limits you built on yourselves and understand that they're doing it to better themselves.

What can we do?  Shed some light on actual news rather than opinions.  Quit being so negative and in return this whole subreddit will evolve from negativity to positivity.

UnReal31337	19	3	44	"I'm a Filipino American who happens to visit my family in the PI at least once a year. Every time I visit, the speeds I experience are slower than what I'm used to. In my experience video on YouTube at standard definition broadcast resolution will lag usually lag on the buffering for a minute or two. Now I understand that the nation is still developing it's infrastructure but I'd like to know from an insider's perspective what has led to the current status quo? Have speeds improved in since the 1990s? Is PLDT like the majority of ISPs here in the states, as in they don't bother to upgrade their infrastructure unless the status quo has changed and a competitor has offered a better deal for better service? (Much like how Google Fiber has caused new Gigabit services to appear and disrupt various markets.) Is there a lack of interest in improving connectivity? Because I could totally see people in power, especially the corrupt and duplicit, discourage more freedom of communication and information along with how fast that data is delivered. 


I believe, like a lot of other internet and free information evangelists and computer science majors with lofty ideals, that wider access to internet and more convenient access can improve people's lives (when used in the right way) and change the world at large (WikiLeaks for example has changed the paradigm for whistleblowers and journalism at large, and free online university courses have changed the way higher education is delivered among other benefits). If I wasn't born in this era, I doubt I would have passion to constantly learn and expand my schema of the world and my skill set. Part of me wants to believe that with software and connectivity, the Philippines can reach a cultural renaissance of new creativity that can enable all to express themselves freely.


Also, this would be a great opportunity to compare each other's connection speeds and bandwidths along with service.


Bonus question that's been pestering me: Would the Philippine news media and society benefit from WikiLeaks style journalism? (Secure communication through cryptographic means, fast delivery and large quantities of data being released, and funding and protecting their sources from retaliation.)

1367446363.0	1died0	Staying connected while living in the Philippines?	greks224	18	3	12	"I will be moving to the Philippines from the US in a few months, and I wanted a bit of advice from both people who have made an international move, as well as those who have lived there all their life. I will be living for a few months in a semi-urban city of approximately 100,000+ nearby Manila and for the rest of my stay Quezon City.

My largest question right now is how I should budget to stay connected, technologically speaking. I currently own a desktop PC, a laptop, two gaming consoles, and a monitor.

Desktop:
I plan to send to send the parts to the Philippines and purchase a new case when I arrive, as my current case is very large. I use this desktop to do occasional photo editing (Photoshop), documenting (MS Office and Google Docs), and heavy gaming (a GTX 570 card). This was $1000 USD of gaming hardware when purchased last year. These days I do most of my gaming on the desktop, it outperforms my PS3 and Xbox360. Which leads me to...

Gaming:
I have a PS3 and Xbox360, as mentioned. I can ship these to the Philippines; I was also thinking that I could simply bring my profiles on a USB key if there are pay by the hour arcades available, as these may sufficiently provide my console gaming itch; most of my time in the Philippines will be spent on my studies.

Laptop:
I currently am ready to replace my laptop with something cheap, light, and good battery life. It is important that my solution is cheap, as I do worry about it getting stolen, breaking, failing, etc. I am ready to go for a $249 Samsung Chromebook for my basic needs, but I do worry about being able to connect to the internet with it with a SIM card. There are 3G Samsung Chromebooks, but will it be compatible with a Filipino carrier? This also may not be an issue if I use mobile broadband on my phone, which leads me to...

Internet:
I would like to have internet access on my desktop, but this may only be practical in Quezon city. For the urban provinces, is mobile broadband my best option? If so, will those SIM cards be compatible with a Chromebook? Or should I simply mobile hotspot on an Android device with SIM card load? Which leads me to... 

Phone: I am currently on USA Verizon with a Samsung S3, which will not be compatible in the Philippines. I plan to get an unlocked GSM Android device, which I believe will meet all my needs in the Philippines. I plan to text, make occasional phone calls, and use the internet for e-mail as well as for my laptop, if possible.
