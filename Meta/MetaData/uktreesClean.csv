I am the creator of the documentary film The Chronic Issue. I am addressing you all today to ask for your help. 
We are currently running our KickStarter campaign to raise £5000 in order to commence the creation of our film. 
This is a film that aims to fight for the change we all know needs to happen. For the past 12 months, we have been working extremely hard forging relationships, gaining sponsors and making friends all over the UK, as well as the rest of the world, so that our ambitious project could be brought to life.
We will delve in to the multifaceted issue of cannabis prohibition and the effect that it has had on our nation legally, socially and medically. We will release the finished product for free online and do not intend on making any profit from the film; Weed World Magazine has graciously offered to host the film on their website. Our goal is for as many people to see this as possible and we believe the best way for this to happen is to not limit it's distribution.

We would love all of you guys to come check out our KickStarter page - http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thechronicissue/the-chronic-issue?ref=live - to find out exactly why, what and how we intend to create this ambitious project. 

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this. All the support we receive is massively appreciated!

Oh! and there are some great rewards for donations you may want to check out! Including the chance to come abroad on a filming trip with us! :D "	t5_2si9d	True

The response I received today:

&gt;I write further to my email of the 13th of December 2011.
&gt; 
&gt;As you will be aware, the Commission had received several complaints regarding the article in the Daily Mail. The complaints had been put to the Commission with a view to it making a decision under the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice. However, in order for it to be in a position to make a ruling it considered that further information was required from the newspaper. As such, the complaints were sent to the newspaper for its comments.
&gt; 
&gt;The newspaper has now responded. In light of the newspaper’s comments, the Commission has decided to formally investigate the complaints, and has selected a lead complainant for the purposes of the investigation. The investigation is now on-going; I will endeavour to inform you of the outcome of the Commission’s investigation once it has been concluded.

1326981155.0	on8rd	This is a genuine warning from a smoker to anyone thinking of getting weed in the South-West London Area (Repost from r/Trees, more relevant to here but didn't realise there was a r/UKTrees)	BeingSerious	93	8	37	"I have been doing extensive research about this since last night and I half expect this to get down voted to oblivion but please hear me out. I think it’s important people get a heads up on this so they can make an informed decision and also tell these bullshit dealers to stop what they’re doing.

I'm 25 and have been a regular (more or less everyday) smoker for about 10 years. I've also had quite a bit of fun every so often with harder drugs whilst at uni. Basically I'm saying I'm not n00b.

In that time I've come across all kinds of good and bad weed, some of the worst bits I've had have been sprayed with sand/glass, dipped in sugar solution for weight or whatever. Anyways I picked up 3 bags last night from someone who I know pretty much deals to the whole of the South-West London area through themselves and a shit load of runners. 

This stuff is seriously screwed and I suspect it has been laced with some kind of ~~class A, possibly PCP or whatever.~~ extra chemical, following feedback and more information most likely a legal high. This makes sense in terms of ensuring the lacing is affordable and cost effective. 

Also suggestion from the below thread which was very interesting is [AM-694](https://www.buyresearchchemicals.co.uk/cannabinoids/buy-am-694.html) or a similar AM compound. Interestingly I believe the descriptions of its sensation [here](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=132850) are similar to what I felt but really rather horrible rather than nice. There's a particular line about there being 'something missing' in the high which I totally agree with. Also a highly speculative hypothesis as a neuroscience graduate is that an AM compund of this type responsive to a particular type of CB neuroreceptors, [CB1 according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM-694), would produce a similar, potentially more intense, high that focuses its effects in unfamilar ways (disassociation, numbeness etc) which are more normally associated with doing a full whitey and being really, really not nicely mashed. Also its high affinity would account for its prolonged effects (I still feel a little strange now) as this would make it harder to be removed from the synaptic cleft. Last little, weird note is I was told this strain of bud is called AMnesia, I capitalised the AM for effect, not them :)

~~*People in r/trees suggested that it could have been a household chemical like Windex, anyone know if this would make you have a strange, intense high?*~~  Apparantly Windex shouldn't alter the buzz you get.

These particular people sell quite small bits because the bud is always meant to be ‘high grade’ and the price usually works out at £10 a gram (which is crap compared to what it used to be back in my day). I mention this so people can understand why this may actually be cost effective to these shitheads as most people say it isn’t worth dealers spiking weed. This is true in most cases. 

So what makes me think the bud was screwed with?

- When I first smelt the weed quickly I thought it was OK and rolled up a J. It tasted of shit and nothing like it smelt.

- Also after smoking a J, leaving my room and coming back instead of having that nice herbal Amsterdam cafe aroma going on it smelt like one time years ago when me my mates smoked MDMA after a pretty mental night.

- On smelling the weed again and more intensely I noticed a really chemical edge to it that actually burnt/irritated my nose.

- Licking, touching the bud with my finger and then licking my finger again gave a slightly salty taste but it was faint compared to weed that I have had before when you could actually feel the granules of salt/sand between your teeth.

- The high it gives you is strong, strange and dissociative. I smoked a second joint about half an hour after the first, not quite putting the pieces together yet, and started looking up stuff about sprayed bud in general, thinking it was some kind of new subtle technique to add weight. About half way through I felt buzzing but not in a nice way at all. I also started feeling slightly numb at my extremities, a little bit like K can make you feel but not as strong as K.

- I then woke up this morning and did more research and went over everything again (smelling the weed, tasting it etc) because I wanted to make sure I wasn’t crazy. I then thought I would smoke smallish joint one last time and see what happened. That was 2 ½ hours ago and I still feel this weird buzz that really isn’t nice and was particularly intense about 30 minutes after finishing the J.

Anyway I’m going to talk to the person about this and try and trade back this shit for some proper bud. I just think this is all kinds of uncool and want other people to know so they don’t get fucked over.

**Tl;dr – It seems like laced weed does exist and is being passed round South-West London. Please upvote so people know.**

I am not an idiot and am not saying this for fun. You want it, go buy it.

For everyone else who would like actual weed, smell and inspect before handing over your money!

**Update 1:- The guy has agreed to trade it without being tricky (which makes me more suspicious), going to ask him what the hell was going and what was in this stuff but don't expect the truth, maybe a little more information. I will post his answer and/or any other details that come up this evening.**

**Update 2:- I added a whole load of crap up top about what could possible be going on, thanks to [muffinFTW](http://www.reddit.com/user/muffinsFTW) on this lead. Managed to trade the bud with the dealer who insisted things were fine when I said 'Level with me on this, I'm not that bothered because you're trading me this stuff' whilst secretly hoping to get the truth. They said that they thought they had given me dutch not this other stuff he called 'amnesia'. I know I can't quantify it but he seemed uncomfortable, mentioned how he had sixty bags to move of this gear and it was longing him out. All of this thread is highly speculative, I get that, but I cannot stress enough that I'm not bullshitting and no matter anyone says I know that this bud tasted wrong and made me feel fucked up in no good way. We pay for bud, we all want bud, not some imitation headache-inducing horrible tasting shit. Anyways thanks so much for the upvotes, I hope no one else gets caught out, if people won't buy this crap there won't be a market to sell to. Happy smoking 8)**"	t5_2si9d	True

1320933433.0	m7e9r	"So the Daily Mail article saying ""even one cannabis joint could trigger schizophrenia"" annoyed me, and I decided to do something about it."	47926	82	6	22	"I sent a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about [the article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2053486/One-cannabis-joint-bring-schizophrenia.html), outlining how it misrepresents the study it's supposed to be based on. The article claims 'one cannabis joint could trigger schizophrenia', but if you look at the study, the conclusions are a bit different. They found that rats dosed with synthetic cannabinoid [CP 55,940](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_55,940) at a dose equivalent to 85 joints in a human exhibit symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia, for a duration of up to around 2 hours.

I received this response today:

&gt;Dear Mr 47926
&gt; 
&gt;Thank you for your email.
&gt; 
&gt;We have received two complaints about this article already, and have contacted the scientists involved at the University of Bristol. They have indicated that they do not wish to make a complaint about the reporting of the study.
&gt; 
&gt;In view of the Commission third party policy (which may be seen here: http://www.pcc.org.uk/faqs.html#faq4_7) we will now ask the Commission to determine whether it is able to proceed with the case in the absence of the involvement of the authors. We will be in touch shortly.
&gt; 
&gt;Complaints Officer Chris Paget will now be dealing with this matter. His email address is chris.paget@pcc.org.uk and you should add him to your email safe list for further correspondence. Should you have any queries or require any further advice, please do not hesitate to contact him on [phone number removed].
&gt; 
&gt;The editor of The Mail on Sunday is currently a member of the Press Complaints Commission.  However, as the Daily Mail, the sister newspaper of the Mail on Sunday, is the subject of your complaint he will of course not take part in any discussion or consideration of the complaint by the Commission.
&gt; 
&gt;Yours sincerely
&gt;

So while the authors of the paper decided not to act, the PCC may act anyway. It's a small victory, but it feels good to know that being reasonable can make a difference. If a few of us do the research when the media puts out stories like this, and submit well explained complaints explaining the factual inaccuracies, maybe we can start to sway public opinion."	t5_2si9d	True

Eurobob	81	7	32	"When i first arrived in uktrees, it was a humble place with a population of barely a dozen people, and in less than a year we have grown to 2000 strong! It's been amazing to watch the subreddit increase with activity from happy ents across the nation, and i know many (including myself) consider this more of a family than r/trees.

Don't get me wrong, i love r/trees for spearheading this level of internet community for us peaceful folk, [but it has gotten a little too silly of late.](http://i.imgur.com/sxcxN.jpg) And while i do still enjoy it a lot of the time, it's good to come back here and see a higher self-to-image post ratio filled with questions, answers, thought-provoking articles &amp; important news.

We've picked up a fair bit of momentum now, so we just need to continue to keep an eye out for our fellow brits who haven't yet journeyed from across pond (As i have proudly, already seen many of you do). 

With any luck, as our size increases, we may even become recognised by the media in much the same way r/trees has in the US. In the future, we may struggle with some stereotypical posts threatening our reputation as a legitimate community, and so we may have to introduce some guidelines, but as long as we play it cool we could potentially help to shed some light on the frivolous nature of prohibition. And despite the mishaps recently with peter reynolds, we still have CLEAR fighting the cause. Hopefully within our lifetime we will see an end to this senseless war on our beloved plant.

So this one's for you guys, the proud members of the british entpire who have made this community what it is. You've organised meets, shared advice, stories &amp; news, even created your own uktrees subreddits! And let's not forget about dhc23, who made an incredibly altruistic gesture towards the community not too long ago. Thanks to you wonderful people, our lore is writing itself, and in years to come we elders shall tell our young saplings of the great dhc donation to our family, and of the great fight to end the prohibition.


Peace &amp; Love,

Hugs &amp; Nugs,

I'll meet the requests of all those I pull out until the supplies are exhausted. I'll then PM everyone who's got something and will start sending stuff out on Wednesday/Thursday.

However, when I consider the potential for these kinds of moves in old Blighty, I realise a pretty harsh pinch of salt that is to be considered.

You see, American cannabis culture is a long-standing entity. It has its own music, cultural iconography, slang and holidays. Everything a textbook subculture has. It has been around for decades and has spread across borders. The 420 notion is supported in this country, sure, but only by those who smoke cannabis and are looking for a group of people to attach themselves to based on that fact. Quiet smokers in this country (who make up the majority of the market) smoke weed, but do not typically celebrate that fact.

When someone submits a petition on epetitions and posts links asking people to sign it, it fails to take off. Why is that? I would say that it is largely down to the fact that smokers do not wish to sign a document with their real name as it is not worth it. They know that widespread support (even from smokers) is unlikely at best.

In the UK we buy and smoke cannabis products in our thousands on a daily basis. There is little risk involved when one has a solid supplier, so why rock the boat? How much do we really *need* it?

The Americans, with their 420 culture, have an advantage over us in this respect. They exist as a loose-but-unified body, which is absolutely crucial in political efforts. Smokers in the US identify as a unit, with common gripes and goals that seep into popular mainstream culture and into the minds of voters.

My thinking is that as the US fight intensifies, we grow closer to the freedoms we would similarly like to attain. We do want to be able to smoke weed legally. We do want to be able to purchase quality cannabis from regulated outlets. We do have sick people who wish to see cannabis explored for its potential medicinal benefits. What I see though, is a long wait. Supporting the American fight where possible is a step in the right direction. We know all too well that the DEA is essentially the international drug police and that their will is the law of countless nations around the world.

I propose that the only way we will legitimately see similar changes in the UK is through ensuring the freedoms of cannabis users in the US. British politics looks to the west for guidance on this subject and their triumphs will eventually be shared by us.

Of course, this is not ideal. We have great minds in this country. We have scientists, politicians and activists who boldly take this cause upon themselves and try their best. I simply fear that these efforts are in vain without an open-eared anti-prohibition subculture which can run with them.

Can anyone really envision the UK legalising and controlling cannabis before we can point to an established and successfully reformed American system? What about a European effort? Can anyone see the UK taking into account the success of reform as found in Portugal, Spain or the Czech Republic?

I don't know, I'm just venting I guess. I'm interested to hear what you guys have to say on this and absolutely encourage criticism and debate on this post.

Do you think these are actual experiences?	eenieboy	66	7	59	"""It was a normal night at the local park with our crew until a girl from a rough area, near where we live, came down. She recognised a few of us from a festival. She was acting all hard because she had smoked a lot of cannabis that day. She was asking if we knew any dealers and we did know a few but never really spoke to them. She was determined to get some green and when she finally got 20 pounds worth, she forced us to start smoking it with her. Bearing in mind we had never done it before, it was really scary.

We all had a few drags on the “bifta” because she was pressuring us. About three people were sick and the rest just chilled out and brought loads of food like biscuits and crisps.

The girl started to get paranoid and told us her life story. She had put girls in hospitals and threatened people with knifes. Then she started on one of our crew, and she pulled out some scissors that she had used to make a “pipe”.

Our friend started to cry and couldn’t stop. We all felt sick, then the police showed up and took us all to a cell for the night. This was four months ago and I’m still grounded. This was the worst experience of my life, I will never do it again."""	t5_2si9d	True

The purpose of the film is to remove stigmas currently attached to cannabis in the UK; the only way the film will have any weight is if it has people willing to step forward and give cannabis the voice it so desperately needs in the UK.

Seeing as you're UK Ents, you've probably heard Peter Hitchens of the Daily Mail spouting his non-factual, ""drugs are bad"" rubbish about trees many times. 

Today, he writes a negative blog post about Twitter, and still manages to slip in a sentence about how deadly cannabis is. What makes it worse, is that in his second paragraph he says, ""I prefer to follow facts and logic to their conclusion."" But then continues to slate cannabis with zero facts or logic.

The worst part? I leave a polite comment on his blog at least a few times a week, simply asking for some evidence of what he's saying. However, not a single comment has been approved to display on the website. 

He was also consulted upon at the recent G+ debate on drugs, as well as the government drug policy thing that's going on lately. **He's a journalist!!! Surely the only people that should be consulted on national drug policy should be experienced users or actual scientists???**

Apologise for the negativity, guys, I'm normally a happy and peaceful Ent. But there's something about this guy that grinds my gears. Why is somebody with zero knowledge of a topic given such a high platform to speak about it from?

EDIT: Forgot the link to the actual article I mentioned -- http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/06/twitter-is-an-electronic-left-wing-mob.html 

EDIT #2: Spelled his name wrong in the title, should be ""Hitchens"", not that it deserves to be spelled correctly. xD"	t5_2si9d	True

We have a map in the side bar where you can find local ents, you can quite easily discreetly mail them about a hook up in your area, but if they refuse, **do not harass them**.

If you do meet someone for a hook up, be safe about it! meet in a safe public place first off, bring a friend with you or make sure someone knows what you are doing and lastly use your common sense! I dont want any ents get raped or kidnapped or such!

After several people messaging me saying they would be late I have decided to change the time. Although I'm sure some of you will want to meet at the earlier time anyway and that's fine.

**Get ready to take part the biggest UK trees meet up to ever happen.**

Following on from my original post about a London meet up at the natural history museum I have set the date for Monday the 19th of December. This will be a great opportunity to meet fellow ents, toke up and have a fascinating day out in the city.

Im proposing the day should look something like this but would really like your imput on where to roam about in London:

* 10:40 - 11:00 Meet in Hyde Park at the Princess Diana memorial fountain. You can take a bus or tube so if unfamiliar with the area check what time you have to leave to get here on time. The Group should be easily recognized but I shall also give out my number over PM to people who would like it.

* 11:00 - 11:30 Get to know each whilst lighting up. Bring your finest bud to smoke and any extra you want to share. (My idea in inviting you all to this so early is so that you can save up and buy a good amount of high quality weed each.)

* 11:30-11:45 Walk the short distance to the Natural History Museum, its only up the road.

* 11:45 - 15:55 Explore the Natural history museums many mesmerising exhibits. The museum is completely free to enter and an absolutely amazing place, there is something for everyone, too much to see in one day but I will try my best to show you my favorite bits. Food is very expensive so bring snacks if your going to get the munchies.

*  15:55 - 16:10 Regroup and walk back to Hyde Park in time for **4:20** 

After that we could go to the south bank IMAX to watch a 3D film and then have a meal or go skating on the rink outside the museum or just hang out its completely up to you what we do.

**This is not something that you are going to want to miss so put it in your calendar and be there, its down to you to make this happen and become the most successful meet up we have ever had.**

[MY ADDRESS, ALIGNED TO THE RIGHT]

[HIS ADDRESS, ALIGNED TO THE LEFT]

Dear [MP'S FULL NAME WITH ANY HONORIFICS, MP]

**BLOOD DRIVING LEVELS FOR CANNABIS USE**

I am writing to you to voice my concern about the pending decision to set the blood driving level of 2 ug/L for cannabis.

Regardless of whether driving in an altered state of mind is dangerous, the planned ‘zero tolerance’ approach is not an effective solution to this problem. A blood level of 2 ug/L could detect use within the last 24 days.

http://www.aacc.org/publications/clin_chem/podcast/Documents/ClinChem201108_Huestis-OralFluid.pdf

My reference for this 2ug/L measurement creating a 24-day detection window is at the bottom of page 4, with an analytical limit of 2 micrograms per litre. Dr Marilyn Huestis, Chief of the Chemistry and Drug Metabolism branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that “at the higher proposed 2 micrograms/liter SAMHSA cutoff for just THC, we've the same program with detection for a very long in the terms of 24 or more days”.

This decision effectively means that a cannabis user who has been sober for more than a fortnight could be treated the same as someone driving heavily under the influence of alcohol. As the effects of cannabis typically last at most 6 hours, then to do a test with such a large detection window is unethical.

My reference for the length of the effects of typical cannabis highs: 

http://norml.org/library/health-reports/item/norml-s-marijuana-health-mythology#10

Cannabis use detection in drivers is important, but the proposed choice of equipment is not the right one. An onsite swab test, with a window of around 12 hours, would be much more appropriate.

http://www.testcountry.com/drug-testing-cutoff-levels.asp

My reference for a 12-hour detection window is found under ‘Saliva Drug Testing’.

From talking to people who've been caught for possession and reading the laws I've found out about the 3 strikes policy. The policy seems to have been introduced when cannabis was reclassified as Class C (it is now class B again) but still seems to remain in place now. 

First time - confiscation and a a telling off for being so naughty. (verbal warning only)

Second time - confiscation and a written warning (a cannabis warning that is not a criminal record and is separate from a police caution)

Third Time - Taken 'down the station' (arrest) for a police caution and possible prosecution. 

A police caution will stay on your record, a cannabis warning will not as it not shared between county police departments. E.g if you've been caught twice in London but then a third time in Yorkshire you will only receive a verbal 'first time' warning. 
I have also read that the 3 strikes have to occur within the same year to get a police caution but I am not certain on that. Does anyone know?

Would this make a good sidebar addition?

Thanks!


EDIT: Just a note saying to be polite and courteous when talking to the police as I'm sure most of them see prohibiting cannabis is a waste of time too! Plus no-one likes a dick.

EDIT 2 - No source I'm afraid, this is all just from talking with my friends and people I know. There is some info from the [BBC here from 2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7850342.stm) but obviously it's a bit out of date - but does mention the £80 fine for a second offence /u/robaintcool mentioned.

From what I've read and from what you guys have been saying cannabis policy seems to be set by the local police force to some extent. You're not going to be in much trouble the first time you're caught it seems but after that it might depend on where you live!

1346779601.0	zcf47	Weed with tobacco	RuckingFetard	50	6	153	"Hello!

So I've been a weed smoker for *nearly* a year now.  Before I started smoking I was very against weed. I believed all the propaganda and lies that are spread about this wonderful plant. I've had depression nearly all my life and this is the reason I started smoking. I was sick of the anti-depressants so i took to the internet to find a more natural cure.  I tried St. Johns Wort which helped none, then i found marijuana.  Since I began, I've been a different person. I've been happy which was a feeling I still am getting used to today. I feel like I *want* to live. 

Anyway, before I started smoking I did a lot of research. Obviously, even as big as the Internet is, I found a lot of information from American Ents. So I began smoking weed based on their advice. I didn't know anyone who smoked so all I had for information was the net.

Since I've started smoking I've met a fair few UK Ents and you've all had one thing in common. You all roll with tobacco. When I enquire as to why I've had various answers ranging from ""it burns better"" to ""it's how I was taught"". 

Curious, I took to the Internet again to find out why British Ents (and most Europeans I gather?) smoke with baccy. I found a few reasons online but I'm unsure as to which are true.  The most believable reason I could find was that the uk used to have a high hash market and the easiest way to smoke was to mix it with baccy. Once we had cannabis buds the baccy habit just stuck. 

Now, this isn't some self-righteous ""don't smoke with baccy"" post (although I do advise you all to check out Clear's [Toke Pure](http://www.clear-uk.org/tokepure/) page), but I am curious Ents, why do you guys smoke with baccy? Do any of you plan to change or are you happy doing what you're doing? 

Also, if anyone knows it, please share how the baccy trend started!

EDIT: wow a lot of comments here. Please use this for discussion guys. A lot of people are getting downvoted just for saying they do/don't use baccy. That's not what the downvote is for!"	t5_2si9d	True

I'm hoping for a little critique of my letter to my PM. There is a bit of hyperbole in there, too much?



Dear Gareth Johnson,

I would like to extend my gratitude for your service to our constituency. 

I am a 26 year old professional with a passion for the betterment of mankind, I give a considerable amount of my free time to voluntary work.

Something has been troubling me recently which I wanted to highlight to you. People in your constituency are being imprisoned (that is to say locked in a cage with murderers) for owning plants. The cannabis plant has been subject to unsuccessful prohibition since 1928, the drug war has failed. Last year there where zero cannabis overdoses, the year before was the same, as was the year before that. No substance is truly safe, (there were 6,584 deaths directly related to alcohol in 2009) however, the threat posed by cannabis is not a case for it's continued prohibition, rather they are a case for its regulation. 

The case for the regulation of cannabis is long and persuasive, including; protecting children in the same way we do from tobacco and alcohol, medical use, job creation, removing the need for users to interact with criminals.

Prohibition has alienated communities from the police, destroyed families and wrecked careers and has totally failed in its goal of eliminating cannabis use.

 I hope you will give serious consideration to supporting the growing movement among the people of Britain, our media and several voices in government for the abolition of prohibition and regulation of cannabis in order to protect the vulnerable, strengthen the economy and deliver health benefits to those in need.

I feel many people in the uk dont know just how much evidence there is for medical cannabis and doubt it works or that its only for hiv/cancer patents.

Also the public know little to non on the [Endocannabinoid system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system) in your body. Which is why cannabis works and has wide medical uses, cannabis contains the largest natural source of cannbinoids  found outside the body.

Thanks goes  to [greenpassion memebers](https://www.greenpassion.org/index.php?/forum/99-grannys-list/) for making the list.

1357679950.0	167ely	A guide to using Silk Road, specifically for /r/UKtrees	Rosetti	49	9	28	"Hey all, I’ve seen a few posts on here asking about using Silk Road to purchase trees. I’m not an expert, but I have used it successfully a few times now, so I figured I’d write a guide to help anyone out.



**1. Getting on Silk Road.**

Silk Road exists on what is commonly referred to as the ‘Hidden internet’, or ‘Deep Web’; Websites on the hidden internet are not indexed and thus not accessible by regular search engines or DNS lookups. You can do more research on this if you want - to be perfectly honest, I don’t understand it entirely - but you don’t need to.


To access Silk Road and the rest of the Hidden Internet, you need to download a piece of Software, called Tor. This software allows you access hidden websites via a regular browser window. Just head to [Tor’s Website]( https://www.torproject.org/) and click the download. Once the files are downloaded, unzip and click Start Tor.


To head to Silk Road, enter the following address
silkroadvb5piz3r.onion


You’ll need to make an account, this is pretty straight forward.   
(Make sure you remember your pin. You don’t need it when logging in, but you do need it when confirming transactions. Also, your pin doesn’t actually have to be a ‘pin’, mine is just another regular password)


Note: Due to the nature of the Onion network/service, it’s quite slow. And a busy site like Silk Road can be even slower. So, it may be that you have trouble connecting. If it doesn’t work, hit refresh a couple of times, and then just try again later. I usually have better luck in the morning 9pm-12pm and late evening 10pm-4am


**2. Bitcoin.**

Bitcoin is a decentralised peer 2 peer based currency. Essentially, it’s an untraceable and anonymous currency. Purchasing Bitcoin can be a little tricky, there are a number of ways to do it.

There are exchanges such as MTgox and Intersango, and many direct Bitcoin purchasing sites such as Bitstamp, and BitInstant. The problem with many of these sites is they operate outside of the UK, and as such getting money into them can be tricky. They tend not to accept debit credit cards, and often require bank transfers via IBAN. However, banks will often charge you a fee for using IBAN (I know Natwest charges £10). 

These websites will allow you to deposit money into your account, and then place orders to convert that money into Bitcoin.


Other easier websites are [Virwox](https://www.virwox.com/), and [Block Chain](http://blockchain.info/). 


With [Virwox](https://www.virwox.com/), you first need to convert currency into Linden Dollars (SLL) (a currency used in the game Second Life) then into Bitcoins. However, Virwox does not allow for fractions of bitcoins, which means you can easily end up being just shy of a full bitcoin and having ‘worthless’ SLL.   
One nice thing about Virwox is that they accept UKash vouchers. So if you want no trace of your purchases, you can go buy UKash vouchers at any Paypoint and then deposit those. 


[Block Chain](http://blockchain.info/) used to only be depositable via Barclay’s Pingit, but has since opened up regular bank transfers, I found this worked really well the last time I used it, so I’d recommend it.


You can also buy bitcoins in person by searching on Local bitcoin.
In addition, there are also people selling Bitcoins on Ebay, but very overpriced, so I wouldn’t recommend that.


There are a tonne of places to buy bitcoin, some accept cash/cheques in the mail as well. You can always find more by googling.


**3. The purchasing process.**

 You need to send your purchased Bitcoins to your SR account, you can find your bitcoin address under ‘Account’ at the top of the screen. It can take a few hours for the transfer to take place.

Once in your account, you’re ready to purchase, simply find whatever it is you wish to buy, click add to cart, and then head to the checkout. Select a postage method for your items and click go to confirm the postage.

Now, you need to input your address and your pin.

Now, you might have heard of PGP encryption by this point, it’s a form of public/private key encryption used on SR to protect the addresses of its users.  

For this, I’m just going to steal mr_kyitty’s guide from [this thread.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/ynhn2/need_help_with_pgpplease/)


&gt;1. Get gpg4win, install, and open 'GPA'
2. Now you need to make your own key. Go to Keys&gt;New Key, and follow the prompts. Use a fake name/e-mail. Before entering a passcode, write it out (the longer the passcode, the better, and you have to enter it every time you encrypt something). Once that's done, you have your own key.
3. Import the seller key from the seller page. To do this, copy the public key from the page, paste it into a blank notepad file, and save the file. Then click 'Import' in GPA and load that file. You now have that seller's public key.
4. To encrypt your address, open the clipboard in GPA and type in your address. Click encrypt, select the seller's public key, and in the lower box, check ""sign"" and select your own key. Then you will be prompted to enter your passcode. Once complete, copy the block from the clipboard and paste it into the address box on the shopping cart page.

I’d like to add, that you don’t need to ‘sign’ the encryption. What this does is allows the seller to verify that you are the actual sender of the message. However, I’d argue this isn’t entirely necessary, as it will also require you to post your public key somewhere. 


Click to confirm the transaction, and that’s the order placed.  

It will now show up under your ‘orders’ section. You’ll notice an option to ‘finalize’. 

Silk Road uses escrow, i.e. they hold your money when you place an order, and when the order is confirmed to have gone through (after x days) the money will be sent to the vendor. You can Finalise early, by clicking the finalise button and sending them their payment. It’s common courtesy to do this once your item has arrived. If an issue arises, you can click resolve, and attempt to claim a refund/resolve the issue. I don’t have any experience with this so I’d recommend you search /r/silkroad for advice if you need assistance on resolving a matter.

Some vendors might ask you to finalise early before they will send your order. Now, this is actually against Silk Road policy, but its common for vendors to ask for this from first time buyers. Personally, I would say just don’t do it. You never know what’s going to happen. But generally speaking, a vendor's reputation is probably worth more than your particular order, so the risk of being 'ripped off' is low.

Still, I wouldn't recommend it.



**4. Additional Comments**

*Do I recommend it for weed?*

I started using SR Last year after I moved back home from Uni, because I no longer had a dealer. Personally, if I had a choice, I would choose to buy from a dealer every time. SR is a lot of hassle, so I wouldn’t recommend it for your general Eighth or quarter, unless you have no other connection (as is unfortunately the situation for me). 

However, there are a variety of strains and products available, ranging from hashes to oils to edibles, so some of you might like to have those options.

In terms of price, I’d say it’s fair. A lot of Weed vendors will have a standard strain that they’ll sell for a (roughly) standard £20/eighth. You will generally be spending a little more given the nature of the process.


*Is it risky?*

In terms of general legal risk, you can't control what people send to you. If there's no record of you having bought it (Which there isn't, buying bitcoins is not a crime) then you should be fine.  
In terms of 'Will I get scammed risk' - it's just like ebay, people value their reputation. Buy from high repped vendors, and you should be fine.

Anyway, that’s all folks, I hope you’ve found this helpful. If you have any questions, leave a comment, and I’ll do my best to help you out. 

Also, if any other more experienced SR users have noticed any mistakes or things I should alter in this guide, please leave a comment and let me know, and I’ll make the necessary amendments.

And here are some other great subreddits which you may also find useful.

Christ, we used to be able to pick up an Oz for a tonne, now its more than double that!


I don't know where the original £20 1/8th came from but at the same time I don't understand where it's gone, is it due in part to the rise on police ""cracking down"", harder to import? harder to grow without getting caught or is it just pure greed?


Maybe it's just me or the south.

Anyway

So i have this [bong set](http://www.everyonedoesit.com/img/products/dude-bong-small.jpg) Ive only used it like 3 times and want to pass it on to someone who will actually use it! Ill give it a bit of a clean but not promising it will be gleaming :P
  


*Set includes:*   
Small glass bong  (21 cm tall i think)  
Stem  
4 gauze filter things + 1 used   
Plastic Grinder  
Lighter
  
All in a Luxuriously cheap carry case.

So heres the deal. I would rather it had a good home. 
Pay for shipping (i dunno it was about £5 when i ordered it)  
Post a happy picture of you enjoying the bong afterwards  
&amp; Pay it forward when you can.

----------Update----------

So i did some dice rolling and purelyrhetorical Won! so Gratz to him.

This is updated because I didn't realise that people needed to make accounts to add markers when I made the last topic and I messed up. Instead of just editing my last one I'm making a new topic so people who already read the last topic and won't go back can see this.

So, in order to add markers now without creating an account you can use these login details:

Username: UkEnts

Password: uktreeslogin

[Here's the link to the actual map where you can login and add points.](http://www.communitywalk.com/smoke_spots_uk/map/1497259)

Last new point, is that you can add photos to your markers, so if you get a chance, do that.

[Copied details from my last topic:

Basically I thought it would be good to have a list of good smoke spots in the UK on a map so we could enjoy them. The map is only available if you have the link so you won't get random people going to your spots, it will only be [/r/uktrees](/r/uktrees) which is a pretty small community so it's all good. If you're worried about police, then don't be. Unless police actively monitor [/r/uktrees](/r/uktrees) which I doubt they would then they won't get the link, and even if they do it's really just a list of nice spots to chill out, regardless of if people smoke or not so they aren't going to send police to patrol parks or whatever.

The map would be good as people new to an area can find some good spots and even people who have lived in a city their entire life can too.

To add a marker: just hit add marker and click where you want, put in the name something like 'Overlooking the beach', 'Camping spot' and in the description put in some various tips you can think of like if there is a police presence, places to eat nearby, little hidden gems near it or whatever.

tl,dr; add your smoke spots to the map ]"	t5_2si9d	True

I think that the effort you make towards decriminalisation in the uk at the moment will carry more momentum than ever before, so there's more incentive to make it.

Dear [name]

I am writing to you as my MP because I want you to help me.

I am dismayed that David Cameron dismissed the recent HASC drugs inquiry report out of hand and then the next day admitted he hadn’t even read it. What is the point of expensive inquiries like this and Leveson if the government is just going to disregard their findings and recommendations?

All over the world, governments are adopting innovative new approaches to tackling drug problems that are proving to work effectively. In Portugal, for example, decriminalisation of drugs has decreased addiction rates, decreased drug related violent crime, decreased the costs of policing, and decreased the spread of harmful viruses like HIV that cost the NHS millions every year, to name but a few benefits.

I don't advocate the adoption of these exact policies in the UK, I understand that cultural and societal differences need to be considered. However i don't understand why, in the face of progressive examples like these, David Cameron and the UK government have outright refused to even consider the recommendations given to them by a scientific enquiry.

Please will you tell me exactly what you will do to make sure this issue is properly addressed? Or in the case that you think it shouldn't be addressed, I believe i am entitled to an honest explanation as to why not.

Yours sincerely [name]

1333368586.0	rped6	Just Email this to my local MP	timtam1004	37	6	19	"Dear Mr Hoban

I am writing somewhat informally in order to calculate your stand point on the prohibition of Marijuana as well as your view to the future of what is rapidly becoming quite a hot topic. I am a member of a group you have probably heard of, CLEAR, of whom are fighting to end this prohibition with sensible and reasonable argument fully backed with facts and figures that display, for all intent and purposes an argument difficult to disagree with. Yet the government still turns a blind eye to the obvious ludicrousness of this dated law. The question i want to put to you is, to what end ? Why is this illegal ? Why is something that can help the sick and the people that are in pain illegal ? Is it because the government can happily sit there and watch members of their society suffer in order to save face ?
 Why is a plant, that grows naturally on our planet, that could potentially raise Six Billion Pounds a year in taxes, if it was regulated and taxed at £1.00 a gram. £1.00 a gram ! and the government would reap the reward and be able to aid the country in any number of ways. Why is that illegal ? Is it because the government currently has to much money ? Is it because we are economically comfortable and really don't need the money that bad ? I suspect not. 
I know there is one excuse that the government has managed to hide behind for quite some time, Marijuana Causes Mental Issues. Thats the primary reason that the public is coaxed into backing this phony policy. But its not quite as cut and dry as that. Upon a few hours of research i was able to come across some statistics: In 2009 a study was completed on the psycho-effects of Marijuana, it read the following results, You would need to STOP 2800 heavy users of Marijuana or 30,000 light users EVER using Marijuana in order stop ONE case of schizophrenia. 
It also suggested that annual hospital admissions for mental and behavioral disorders relating to Cannabis average at 750 cases per year. 750 is still quite alot though right ? Well lets compare it to the stats against Alcohol, a drug openly accepted, advertised, used and abused by, lets face it, at some point or another 99% of our country, Alcohol causes an annual hospital admission rate of 47,000 suffering from mental and behavioral disorders. 47,000 cases of mental and behavioral disorders at the hands of a drug the government deems ok. 

As i sit here, utterly perplexed at how this medieval method of thinking still governs a portion of our population in the year 2012, i implore you to see sense. I also request a meeting with yourself in order to discuss the issue at length.
It's not simply all about stats and facts Mr Hoban, its about realizing your mistakes as a government, swallowing your pride and making amends. The reason this prohibition has lasted this long is because unfortunately leaders, governments and people in power (similar to yourself) have tarred the issue, surrounded it with lies and propaganda and force fed the population this concoction of deceit, a population who have mindlessly swallowed it with nothing more than a smile. 
Unfortunately opinions are beginning to change. People are starting to realize the ludicrousy of it. And things will change. Its an issue of time. 

I look forward to reading your re-post and potentially meeting with yourself. 
Have a Wonderful Day

The trick here is to travel via ferry, not plane. P&amp;O Ferries do an awesome 'Minicruise' deal which offers an en-suite room aboard the ferry, a coach into the center of Amsterdam in the morning, a coach back to the ferry in the evening and an en-suite room on the way back.
The total cost of this is £72 for 2 people! Ferry departs from Hull.


This is perfect if you fancy just a day in Amsterdam, but if you want to stay for longer (which I did) then you can book an extended stay which just means you get the coach back to the ferry a day later. You need to arrange your own accomodation in Amsterdam, but a search on the internet finds some nice hotel rooms for around £40 a night (per person).


The night on the ferry is the downside, but I went with my friends and it was a great night getting drunk on the ferry.

Thank you for your e-mail about drugs policy. Drugs policy is an emotive and complex issue with many contradictory views, as was recently demonstrated by the recent publication of the Home Affairs Select Committee Drugs Inquiry Report, ‘Breaking The Cycle’.
 
Having seen the damage that illegal drugs does first hand in the constituency, I am yet to be convinced by the arguments for either relaxing existing laws or legalising some of the currently illegal drugs.
 
I am particularly concerned by the significant amount of scientific evidence of cannabis harm and the rising numbers of cannabis users seeking medical treatment, particularly as a result of the strength of the cannabis that now dominates the UK market.
 
Professor Peter Jones of Cambridge University, one of Britain’s leading psychiatrists and an expert in schizophrenia, addressing an Institute of Psychiatry (London) Conference on 28th November 2005 said, 'Cannabis is a huge issue for psychiatric services at this moment. I work in a first-contact schizophrenia service and it might as well be a Cannabis Dependency Unit'.
 
He warned that children of 10 or 11 who start smoking the drug could be trebling their risk of schizophrenia. He said that 80% of first episode psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses occurred in either heavy users of cannabis or cannabis dependents.
 
Cannabis is a proven independent risk factor for psychosis. Patients can continue to need anti psychotic medication for life as I am sure many clinical psychiatrists would confirm.
 
I am also concerned by people advocating the decriminalisation of a drug 20 times more cancerous than tobacco at the very time the law is being tightened on cigarette sales through display bans, public smoking bans and plain packs.
 
I believe that reducing demand for drugs through controls and prevention will do most to help the problem here at home and most to reduce the scale of the international market and problem. The simple fact is that drug use is stable and has declined significantly since the 1990s. Even cocaine use after doubling over the last decade is losing its allure and has begun to drop.
 
The fact is that drug use is a risky minority activity that most people do not have a taste for. Compared with the 20 per cent plus of all adults who smoke (just about still legal) only 7 per cent of adults used cannabis (ever) last year and even fewer, 2 per cent, cocaine. ‘Problem’ drug use – that’s heroin and crack cocaine – attracts just 0.6 per cent and is on the decline too.
 
There is only one responsible discussion to be had on drugs. That is the urgent need to bring down drug use and the demand for drugs, further, here in this country. This is the responsibility of government.
 
Yours sincerely
 
 
Michael McCann MP
Member of Parliament for East Kilbride, Strathaven &amp; Lesmahagow

1352989640.0	138nhe	10 Reasons to smoke without tobacco and some words from Prof David Nutt	toffilata	54	19	61	"So this is obviously a matter of personal choice, but I feel that so many people are using tobacco unnecessarily with their cannabis. I feel that this is down to social convention as tobacco was used in the days when we smoked mostly imported hashish. Many people do continue to use tobacco with herbal cannabis and I feel that a variety of misconceptions perpetuate this use. I wanted to write a few reasons why tobacco use does not actually give any benefit and perhaps dispel some of the ""myths"" surrounding its use.

Let's not forget tobacco killed 100, 000 000 people in the 21st century which is more than both World Wars combined. Cannabis has not killed anyone. So why bother to add such a destructive drug to such a harmless one?

1. ""It saves me money"". No it doesn't. Firstly you have to shell out a fiver on baccy every week/month which you would not otherwise have to spend.

2. ""It burns better."" If your weed is properly dried (which most I see is nowadays) it will burn perfectly well in a pure joint. If damp, using a pipe does the trick just as well and uses a smaller amount at a time to achieve the same high.

3. ""It saves weed"" - again not true for a few reasons. It tars up your lungs making them less efficient at gas transfer - hence it's harder to absorb the THC to get high.

4. The fact you are mixing it with an addictive drug means you often re-dose (roll another!) when you're still perfectly stoned. Your brain will come to associate weed and tobacco, so even if you don't smoke cigs you'll roll up without thinking and use your stash quicker.

5. Recurrent chest infection. Anyone who smokes tobacco will get more chest infections. Ever find these stick around or become a chronic cough? That's the baccy, it pisses on your immune system.

6. Baccy stinks the house out more.

7. ""It tastes better."" Trust me it doesn't it just stops your ability to taste. Why not actually taste the strain of weed your smoking. A nice lemon haze? Then what's the point of ruining it with a generic tobacco ash flavour which also ruins the taste of your munchies.

8. You're smoking more plant matter than you have to. Cannabis can damage the lungs, but we use such a small amount at a time. Compare this to the amount of tobacco most people use in a joint (often as low as 70/30 or 90/10). There's a huge amount of extra burning plant to damage your lungs giving you [COPD](http://www.patient.co.uk/health/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) etc in future. It also damages your mucociliary escalator preventing your lungs from getting rid of the ash and tar from the cannabis.

9. ""Tobacco smokes smoother."" OK so pure weed might give you more of a tickly cough. That's because the tobacco us killing off the nerve endings that would normally make you cough. It also shut's down your airways, where as cannabis makes them open up - so it's a healthy(ish) cough!

10. ""It makes it easier to share."" I disagree. It does make it easier to hide that fact you're using a tiny amont of weed. It does make a joint look more impressive in a big group. But really what's the point in packing out a joint with nonpsychoactive, extremely damaging baccy? I suggest rolling a pure joint and have fewer tokes, but actually ending up getting stoned. Or just get a american style glass pipe. These can be packed up to go round a group and often stay lit all the way round if done right.

I finally managed to give up the tabacco habit this summer. It does take a degree of willpower, including admitting that if you're a regular user then it's likely you are in fact addicted to the baccy.

As some one who has done both, it is just as easy to smoke pure in a group, it saves money and you will feel much better in your self and in terms of health. 

Sometimes when we make excuses to continue using tobacco, it's really just the nicotine talking. Of course this won't all change due to my preaching but a big change in culture is needed. Most people don't even stop and think about their baccy use. They just do it cus that's the way they learned to roll.

Go on, challenge yourself to smoking it pure!

""The best evidence-based advice to help cannabis smokers look after their lungs would be to abandon the peculiar British habit of mixing cannabis with tobacco.”

Professor David Nutt, chair, Independent Scientific Committee On Drugs

The front door was unlocked and the police walked straight in. Someone shouted 'You can't just walk in' and the officer who was playing the 'bad cop' role replied 'we can do whatever we want - we know the law, you don't'. They exchanged a few whispers and I'm pretty sure they kept the weed, container, 2g of motivator, and space-case grinder for themselves because they said that they wouldn't be pressing charges (as that would require them to document what they had seized)

I'm pretty sure they were allowed in (since the door was unlocked) but the sheer arrogance was enough to make me want to start this project anyway. 

I'm a graphic designer by day, and I'm planning on making a printable business card sized PDF with all your rights explained to you (with references); but at the moment it's pretty hard to find any solid information online. I'd also like to hear if any ukents here are familiar with the law and could help out?

The below is from my experience over the years, some reading online, and watching shite police shows on TV. Please feel free to correct anything that is wrong. I'll be editing this post periodically with all the information I find.

*Home*
&gt; The police need a warrant to enter your house, unless they have a reasonable suspiscion you're comitting a crime. (smell of weed, etc), then they can just walk straight in. If the door is unlocked during a party they can walk in and say that they chapped but you never heard.

*Automobile*
&gt; The police must have reasonable cause to search your car, If you have prior drug offenses this is enough reasonable cause

*Person*
&gt; The police must have reasonable cause to search you. But this reasonable cause can include things like you looking nervous, or reaching for a pocket when you see the police.

One thing led to another and we got onto the discussion of having no thumbs and so the challenge was born. It was fucking hilarious and had me creasing so thought id share.


The challenge: To roll a smokable spliff without using your thumbs. 

Rules: No thumbs until the joint has been stubbed. You can use items (cards, mats) to help.

Tips: Be prepared to make a mess.


We started off small to get a feel for it, rolling the roach, grinding the weed and lighting the lighter but soon the challenge of picking the joint up and rolling without thumbs became apparent. We all developed our own techniques, some of which worked, some of which failed hilariously. Im not gonna give any away cus I want to imagine you working shit out like I did. It took me just under 45 mins to roll and spark up mine but was worth it.

1356888446.0	15ogaz	UK Cannabis Social Clubs - Are you a part of your local Cannabis community?	StealthProctologist	31	4	16	"Hey r/uktrees,

I'm sure there are many of you out there that know all about the UKCSC movement but right now I don't think it's getting the full attention it deserves *(maybe a [link](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) in the sidebar could give it a helping hand, eh mods ;) ?).* The UKCSC movement only began in 2011 so the idea is still very much in it's early stages but having spoken to some of the activists that began the movement, they have plenty of exciting ideas for the future and are always looking for more people to bolster the numbers, get involved in any way they can and help shape the future of Cannabis activism. For those of you that haven't heard of the UKCSC movement, you can find out more about it and find your local UKCSC facebook page [right here](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) but I've put together a little FAQ, mostly paraphrased from that page anyway but it should cover the basics:

*What is a UKCSC?*

United Kingdom Cannabis Social Club - A place for Cannabis consumers from all walks of life to discuss any and every Cannabis related issue, share ideas/ content and organise local meetings &amp; events for fellow UKCSC members to start instigating change on a local level and bring local Cannabis communities together.

*When did the UKCSC movement begin?*

The UKCSC movement established itself in 2011 by a small number of activists spread out across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Driven by the urge to let Cannabis consumers know that there is a community in the UK actively campaigning for positive change. 

*What does a Cannabis Social Club do?*

That depends on the club - right now there are a handful of UKCSC's out there organizing regular local meetings, rallying their local Cannabis community and beginning to make a difference in Drug Policy Law Reform. While most CSC's are online communities at this stage, member numbers are growing and more people are getting their voices heard.

*How can I join my local CSC?*

Select the closest CSC page from [this list](http://cannabiscure.co.uk/uk-cannabis-social-clubs-list-ukcsc-2/) and join their facebook page. I know some CSC's are on the look out for admins at the moment so if you're interesting in getting involved directly then please enquire with your local CSC about it.

Unfortunately the UKCSC pages are only on facebook for now so it's understandable if you don't want to associate your profile with something that, say, potential employers might not want to see. I know some of the guys in the movement are looking to get these clubs off facebook and onto their own dedicated website but some reckon that without the convenience of facebook, they wouldn't have been able to get the ball rolling as quickly as they have.

I probably haven't covered all bases (might be something to do with this wonderful Grape Ape I've been smoking all afternoon) but if you have any questions about the UKCSC movement I'd be more than happy to help.

Thank you for reading and happy toking!

There is to much to list but I'll choose some favourites:

Me and my buddies went to tesco and got a whole chicken, hot and fresh from the rotisserie. We got a loaf of fresh bread and some cheese to accompany it. We felt like Vikings tearing into the juicy meat while soaking up the rich juices with chunks of bread. And it all came to under a tenner :)

Beans on toast with cheese never fails to please! Cheap and easy.

A classics English fry up after a wake and bake is a fantastic experience.

I like to make huge omelettes and cut it into slices. I use up to ten eggs, a shitload of different vegetables all cooked and soft, loads of cheese (cheese is the key) and ham or bacon. 

As an Englishman i always love a curry and a curry when your baked is even better :)



As you can tell I am a fan of more substantial, savoury Munchie foods but sweet and snack suggestions are of course welcome.
And try to leave out the obvious ones such as dominos, subway, McDonald's etc. they are amazing but I want to know what us brits like to eat apart from that.

Peace out from Surrey x

they got out the car and asked us what we were doing, so we fully complied and said we had weed on us, they took the half-rolled joint that my friend was rolling and asked who's the grinder was, it was mine and i had the weed in my pocket so i handed them both over.

the pcso's then radio'd the proper police for them to come and finish the job off, while we were waiting i was asking the pcso's if it would show up on a CRB check, they said usually not, then one asked what aspirations i had, i told him i wanted to be a paramedic, he kicked off with the ""noone who smokes weed is successful"" bullshit. I had to stop him there.

I told him lots of people are successful who smoke weed such as Richard Branson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Phelps, he then proceeded to say more shit like ""it affects your decision making and messes your head up in the future"" I told him that I disagree but refuse to discuss it further. He shut his fucking noise after that.

eventually the cops rolled up, asked me if the weed was mine, said yes, they then asked who my friend was rolling the joint for, i told them for me only. I'm in the shit no matter what anyway, and my friend is 17, so his parents would find out so i thought there was no point dragging my friend down with me, so they just let him off.

in the end, i got a cannabis street warning, my weed taken off me, but not my grinder and let on my way. As we were off, the pcso that was talking shite before shouted as he was getting in the car ""Richard Branson eh? Pick a better role-model!""

That guy was a dick.

I'm not risking getting a criminal record so I'm giving up weed completely now until this warning expires or until the government open their fucking eyes and legalise it.

As im walking along the main road i see a car doing some bizarre things up ahead so coming up to it im a little bit cautious. The car turned down a side street, turned around and came up along side me. It was a beaten up old vauxhall, i thought it would just be someone asking for directions...it was not. An undercover police officer gets out and starts asking me where i have been, where im going, what i have been doing and have a been ""snooping around anyone's houses"" as they've apparently been having burglary's in the area....which i doubt.
I answered all his questions fine, i was polite and respectful, he then asked be if i had been smoking cannabis that evening, to which i said yes. 
Then he obviously wanted to search me. I told him sure but i have some weed on me, got it out in my personal air tight jar and gave them my grinder. He then went through the rest of my bag, all of my pockets, my socks for crying out loud ! All at like 1:30am now, stood on the side of the road.

While all this was going on i was being talked at by his partner who was telling me that she's seen ""people hiding under tables because they are scared of someone coming to get them.....because of weed !!"" as well gems such as ""people will burgle house's to feed they;re addiction.......to weed!!"" ""I've seen people your age forget who their parents are.....because of weed!!!"" 
Absolute fucking rubbish. I told her so in no uncertain terms. I literally went on a 10 minute rant explain how shes wasting my time as well as their time considering im hurting no one. Compared to the amount of problems they get with alcohol me walking home quietly with a bit of weed in my bag and because of that simple fact im the criminal.
So they issued me with a fucking street warning. Took my weed (5-6 grams in a 420 science airtight jar) took my grinder, took my skate tool (because it could be used as a weapon) and took my handy knife i use for skating. It took over an hour all up. WHAT A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME !
Now im either going to have to stop smoking all together or simply only smoke at home and never carry shit with me. I'm trying to get a visa to Australia and really could have done without this pointless situation that could be avoided if anyone in this country had one modicum of sense.

London-based Ent here, originally from Vancouver, BC. Been in the UK about 4 months now and still trying to find my way. Internet hasn't been as helpful as I would have expected, so I have a few uktrees based questions that I'm hoping you folks can sort me out on! For reasons explained below this is unfortunately a throwaway, though I am an active reader of this subreddit on my main acct... ;) 


I realize that some of the answers to these Q's are pretty subjective and that some of my questions are fairly ""vancouver-centric"", so apologies in advance for my ignorance! ;) 


---

1). You guys seem to call your trees different things than we do back home. Here's what I have summarized for myself - tell me what I've got wrong: 

""Haze"": Typically comes from amsterdam. Least potent?

""Cheese"": still haven't figured out what this is. Medium potent? A generic term for bud? 

""Skunk"": This is genetically modified, or enhanced in some way (sprayed on THC?)? It's the highest-grade?  
Back home we used to just refer to trees as ""skunky"" in either a good way (""That shit smells skunky as hell. It's going to be potent""), or a bad way (""That shit is totally skunky. Probably moldy""). I know... in context, we sound dumb. 


---

2). From browsing these forums, I realize that this is a sensitive topic, but how the hell is an 1/8th not one-eighth of an oz? (3.5g) From my reading online this seems to be a case of ""You pay x amount and you get a random amount from a dealer"". Back home it was a case of ""You say what you want, they give it to you exactly, and the price is what is negotiable, based on quality"".

---


3). What if I only want high quality? What am I looking for? ""Skunk""? ""Haze""? Let's say that I don't really care about price (or rather, I'd rather pay £250-300/oz for quality over £150/oz for crap). What should I be asking for? 


---

4). I've read stories of people spraying all kinds of shit on their trees in order to increase weight... Sand... Sugar... Glass shards (wtf!). Is this common or is it sensationalist BS? 


---

5). Hash! We don't really have much of this back home... We mostly roll our joints from pure bud, or smoke in bong/vape. I don't really like tobacco (wimpy canadian!), so making joints from hash doesn't really appeal to me. Seems like hash is a big deal here though. I don't have a question around this, other than to say ""That seems really hardcore!""... ;) 

---


6). I've moved over here for work, and I'm reasonably high up the food chain, so it's not super easy for me to talk to my social circle/co-workers about aquisition. What do you guys recommend for a guy that works in central london and lives in north london? I'm obviously not keen to expose myself to a ton of risk and mostly just care about getting something safe/high-quality/high-potency that I can smoke occasionally. What's my best way of going about doing this?

Now onto the reason why I'm posting here, I was thinking about gathering loads of facts about how Cannabis is so much better than alcohol and why it should be given the chance of legalization. 

Then I would print these facts onto sheets of labels such as ***[these](http://www.eposaccessories.co.uk/images/_zoomMagnify/8000123.jpg)*** and as I go about my daily life, Sticking them to places where people could read them such as on the bus or at a bus stop.

The idea of this is to just get some facts out there about cannabis for the people who have been misguided by the Government and law.

The problem is that I do not want this to litter, I hate it when people litter, simply because it looks disgusting and more importantly people seem to forget that it is not just the human race that lives on this planet and littering is harmful to the environment and animals!

So could anyone think of a way around this? Maybe some faster biodegradable labels? I am open to suggestions, I'm also hoping that maybe this could catch on a bit and a few more Ents do it around? I'm from Peterborough, England by the way everyone!

**TL/DR**, I want a eco-friendly way of spreading Cannabis facts around such as printing them on labels and sticking them where people would see them (such as on busses etc)."	t5_2si9d	True

Some people get the full treatment more similar to the USA, where you call your guy up, go visit him at his place, he'll have a couple jars to select from and he'll weigh it up for you.

Some of us get more of a 'call a guy, meet him on a street corner, wait for 2 hours, get given 1.2 grams of something that might be weed'.

So whats your situation? At the moment i'm mostly picking up off old friends who i grew up with, and it's nice. But they're your typical street corner dealer, and being friends means i dont really get special treatment beyond a much more friendly deal.

The other guy i use is just known as reliable, almost always has Lemon (There was this one time last year ((Holy shit 2012 is last year ow)) where he had blue cheese for like 3 weeks. It wasnt a very fun time). And phonecalls can last 3 seconds, it's 'go to the ladies house'. He's friendly and funny as a motherfucker but will intimidate the shit out of you if you dont know him. He's only been dry 2/3 times over the years i've picked up off him. And these days all i have to do is visit the house of one of his sellers (He has quite an operation going) and it's a straightforwards operation. No waiting about on a street corner, just a quick swift doorstep transaction.

None of my dealers have a selection of strains. It's always without fail the 1 strain and my selection comes down to choosing what dealer. (They'll either text me what strain they have when they get it in, or tell me when i call)


So do any of you get the USA, sit down &amp; choose treatment? I've got a few friends a few miles out of London in Essex (Im in London) who have a wider selection and pick up the strains that want from friends.

Now fingers crossed that someday soon we'll get the USA/Amsterdam experience of just walking into a fucking shop and buying it.

She has suffered from inoperable stomach cancer which has spread to her lymph nodes (Diagnosed in November 2011) After undergoing most of her chemo she suffered a stroke due to the chemo. She now has difficulty reading, writing and talking due to a bleed in the back of her brain, and she had another minor bleed at the front which caused some seizures for 1 day (We think that has recovered)
Now she has some stomach pains from eating and is losing weight. So I need to ask for your honest opinions if weed might be a viable option to get her eating a bit more. I know it makes you hungry (the munchies) and helps with pain, but I'm concerned that it might mess with her brain in her fragile state.

We are not giving up, but I just need to know if it may help her. Thank you everyone"	t5_2si9d	True

I wouldn't want anything for them. The friend who was supposed to pick them up did not show and my wife and I leave on Sunday and I would hate to just toss them. I am moving out of my flat today and will leave a shoebox hidden behind some wood in the car-park. There will also be a pair of 10s men rugby shoes.....they have never been used I purchased them like a week ago and lost the receipt.......Also if someone PM's me or says that they want it I will just PM them the pick up and let everyone know that someone has claimed it so people don't have to go treasure hunting and hope it's still there lol.

UPDATE -  Regisgod has laid claim and picked it all up :) I would just like to say thanks to everyone I met while I was here and hope you enjoy everything Regisgod :)

1322972825.0	mzflg	Felt the need to put this link here.. (petition)	falousco	24	2	4	"Basically, it is the petition currently ongoing to legalise weed in the UK. Now, it is over in the sidebar and I know quite a few people don't read it so I'll post the link [here](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/29). Basically, if it gets 100,000 signatures (bear in mind, 100,000 is a lot but the date we have to get them by is far away) then the topic will be debated in the Commons.

Reason I am putting this here is I saw in the thread where some guy posted ""legalised within a year"" or whatever and people were saying change couldn't come. Now, most politicians are just afraid to speak up about it since it is a taboo subject for them. Now take away the element of fear for them and what do you get? A true debate.

If we can lock them in a room for whatever time it takes and force them to discuss it we can get results. In the past, they have not been forced to answer it without being able to give a bullshit generic response. This forces them to discuss the topic we are passionate on, do you realise how huge that is? Yes, nothing might come out of it but we need optimism for this. I see truly British pessimism in [/r/uktrees](/r/uktrees) which is pretty much stereotypical of us but come on.

Sign the petition if you haven't already, it takes under a minute to create an account and sign it. Now I know a lot of you may have signed it but please pass it around as much as possible. I had not realised it existed until I randomly read the sidebar and am glad I did. This needs to spread, it has clearly gone relatively unnoticed at this moment, we need to get it out.

Cheers.

Non-one recognised anyone else, too many posh folk to go up to strangers asking if they're there to get high haha. My fault really, i should have done the obvious and printed a pic of the Reddit Alien to put on our table for easy recognition!

But anyway, we need to have another crack at this! What did people think of the location? Would you rather meet elsewhere this time around? Somewhere in Southampton again? And of course, when would be best for people?

EDIT 1: The idea of doing a meet-up seems pretty damn popular, would it be worth us creating a uktreesmeetup subreddit? And, for the next South meet, Soton again seems the popular location but it seems you'd prefer to meet on a weekday!

EDIT 2:  How would a Friday work for everyone? And how soon shall we organise this for? I'm thinking within the next month (or sooner) to keep interest and get as many of us pineapple lovers together! Also, it seems that the popular opinion for easy recognition is carboard cutouts of Pineapples, everybody keen for that haha?

EDIT 3: Oct 28th, Nov 4th or Nov 11th seem to be the popular dates meeting somewhere on Southampton common. So lets settle for which date works best, where exactly we're meeting and how we'll recognise each other!

The only fast broadband in the ents area was virgin media 50Meg package for £35/month. The ent thought that was a bit steep but managed to find a cashback site which offered the ent £150 cashback if he signed the virgin deal. So the ent signed up. However, he waited and waited and waited, but the cashback never came. He filed a claim, and he waited and waited some more. Then finally on the 23rd June, almost 6 months later, the ent checked his account and he noticed that £167 had been deposited into his account.

I'll start.  A couple of years ago I found  myself in B&amp;Q buying decorators calk after a morning sesh.  I was stood waiting in line at the checkout thinking about what I would do that afternoon when I noticed people looking at me.  After a quick evaluation as to what was up, I realised that I was speaking out loud what I had been thinking about.  Kinda like I was dictating my thoughts to someone..

Only time it ever happened and to be fair it was pretty funny but it did worry me a bit at the time.  

I'm well over it now though.  Which is nice.

Anyone else done anything crazy

Me and some fellow ents are going to try and help educate the people of our home town Sheffield on April 20th. Just wondered if anyone had any posters with facts about drug war impact/ cannabis legalisation figures/ etc FOR THE UK. Found plenty of things to do with the US but so far very little for our small island. Also if anyone's interested in joining us PM me
                    
Peace out people :)"	t5_2si9d	True

How easy/difficult do you find sourcing your trees in the UK?		22	1	94	"I ask because I generally find it quite difficult and wondered whether it was just my own experience here. It seems fairly abundant in some parts of the states, but that definitely is not my experience. Although there are times when it is easily available, this is not the norm for me.

EDIT: So, now I'm jealous. But also pleased my situation isn't the norm in the UK. You are some lucky ents :D
