He said he was putting a new engine in it and I told him about my 77 CJ5 that I'm rebuilding after it sat in a field for 10 years and the guy goes ""Hmm I might just have a little something to add to your tip"" He unbuttons the back window and pulls out a SET OF CJ5 SIDE PANNELS. (this is the exact part I had been saving up for to replace my rusted out body!). I asked how much and he said it was my tip! 
Greatest delivery ever!!

Me, weakly from my hospital bed: ""YJs. You're forgetting YJ's from 87-95."" I repeated 3X until they realized I was making a comment on their conversation.

Guy one: ""Wow. That chick knows her jeeps.""

EDIT: since it seems relevant, I drive a 77' CJ5 (when he's not in pieces in my garage) and my SO drives a 91' YJ. I'm pretty familiar with both of those.

Roommate; ""What are you doing?'

Me; ""Installing a CB radio.""

Roommate; ""Why are you doing that?""

Me; ""So I can talk to other people with CB radios.""

Roommate; ""But aren't CB's outdated?""

Me; ""Lots of people still use them.""

Roommate; ""But you have a cellphone.""

Me; ""I don't get signal everywhere, and it is a fun way to talk to other people on the trail or the road.""

Roomate; ""Who would you talk to, truckers?""

At this point I'm sore from bending backwards to get under the dashboard, sweating profusely, and now I have a headache from this interrogation.

Me; ""It's a Jeep thing.""

Roomate; ""Must be"", and he walks away.

Five minutes later and roommate #2 comes home.

Roommate #2; ""What are you doing?""
