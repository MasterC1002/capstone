1331513641.0	qs7mx	I am pleased to announce a Doomtree AMA! 	mmm_burrito	44	3	13	"I have just been given the word by Dessa to go public with this news. The AMA will take place on March 22nd. There are more details to come, but I wanted to let you folks know this much now.

Edit: Ok, I am home and can elaborate a little more. The AMA will take place on March 22nd, as I said. As far as I am aware, every member will be present and accounted for. Let me put it this way, Dessa requested that I have accounts set aside for each of the members, and I can't imagine any other reason than that they plan on being here for it.

Now here's the catch: Doomtree is in the middle of a whirlwind tour at the moment. Time is a precious commodity for them, and sitting still for a long period of time just isn't going to happen. They will be logged in and answering questions from 4 to 5:30 MST (They are going to be in Colorado at the time). I know this isn't as long as some AMAs, but it's all they could afford to spend with us.

The plan is to submit the AMA (to the r/IAMA subreddit, to afford them as much exposure as possible) thread early and frontload the thread with questions and discussion before DTR arrives. We want them to be able to hit the ground running and not have to wait for people to start typing and submitting.

Please spread the word about this, folks. These are some good people and I want to make them welcome. "	t5_2s66x	True

1343499757.0	xb1m8	"Essential ""/r/altrap"" albums list"	NoisomeOne	41	2	60	"Alright, so about 4 months ago, a user posted a submission saying that they had recently starting listening to underground/experimental/alternative hip hop and were in need of suggestions and recommendations of albums they should check out. Sadly, I can't find that thread at the moment, but I figured that since this subreddit has probably doubled in subscribers since then, let's start this thread again so we can eventually compile them into one, easy to read list (and perhaps even image).


So. As you guys add to the list, I'll edit this post and add the entries. Keep in mind, these should be albums you'd consider ""essential"" but that are both highly recommended for people looking to get into the genre, and for people who want to expand their current library. I'll start this out with a few basic, obvious ones.

*Edit: If some of the dates on the releases look wrong or if you notice some other error, let me know and I'll fix it. I'll be updating this list throughout the next day or so.*

We hit 2,000 subs a few days ago which, honestly, for a relatively niche subreddit is pretty awesome so again, a big thanks to all of you.

So, to enter the giveaway; leave your **favourite alternative rap/hip-hop track** as a link in the comments along with a sentence or two briefly describing why this particular track means so much to you. 

That's it!

The prizes (once again kindly donated by redditor NoisomeOne) will remain undisclosed until a winner is confirmed. For the record; the prizes are fucking awesome and i'm ridiculously jealous of whoever manages to win them...

**END DATE WILL BE SUNDAY, 29TH JULY**

Also, congratulations to user **mrabbetts** who won the [lyrics mini giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/altrap/comments/wr0hx/2000_subscribers_you_guys_are_awesome/?sort=confidence) and has bagged himself a free PC copy of Portal 2 via Steam.  

Finally, just in case any of you missed it, the legendary Sole did an [AMA here at r/altrap](http://www.reddit.com/r/altrap/comments/wsluf/sole_ask_me_anything_of_sole_and_the_skyrider/) last week and pretty much answered every single question thrown his way. Massive respect to him for that.

Good luck!"	t5_2s66x	True
1342598181.0	wr0hx	2000 Subscribers. You guys are awesome.	Bradk	23	2	13	"Thanks to everyone for making this subreddit everything that it is!

I made this place over a year ago as a way to share a few musicians I was getting into at the time. Little did I know just how many more new artists I was about to be introduced to by you guys...

RIGHT, giveaway time.

[NoisomeOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/NoisomeOne) (one of the most active users here on r/altrap) has been kind enough to offer up a free copy of Portal 2 via Steam as a little giveaway prize for you guys. **Just drop your favourite lyric along with the artist in the comments** and the best/highest voted one will bag themselves the prize (need to have a PC with Steam).

There's a bigger giveaway planned for over the next few days so stay tuned. I promise the prize will blow your damn mind.

Thanks again. Peace."	t5_2s66x	True

1322817775.0	mxd5f	1000 of you beautiful people.	Bradk	17	2	4	"Hi folks, just a quick one to say a **massive** thanks for making this one of the best (at least personally) music-based sub-reddits around.

We're 1,000 members strong now (well 1,003 at time of writing...) and getting stronger everyday. I know we've still got a bit of a way to go and we're not exactly the most talkative of sub-reddits but this all takes time. Plus, we've got some dedicated members helping out with that one too (i'm looking at you NoisomeOne and MykeeBee!), not to mention a whole host of others that have been upping some quality stuff of late.

Anyway, I've got a bunch of ideas I wanna bring to the table that i'll post about in the weeks to come (r/altrap's Top Ten of 2011 being one of them) but if you guys have got any ideas on what you think will benefit this lovely little place then please just give me a shout. There's nothing better than hearing back from a community as tight as this.

Peace.

We've now got a great amount of quality content on r/altrap (over 140 posts) and a good few submitters who have consistently helped the growth to no end (I'm looking at you nanomagnetic, Dune_Baby, MATThill etc.). Also it's good to see the newcomers/lurkers posting recently too (anakin, beadzy etc.)

So, thanks again to all of you and remember; keep listening to music that actually moves something inside of you instead of what the radio feeds you.

Oh and also, if any of you have any experience with creating banners and Reddit aliens and think you could help r/altrap then please do get in touch!

Peace out."	t5_2s66x	True

Allow me to introduce the official [r/Altrap Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/AltRapReddit)! 

I aim to have weekly ""mixtapes"" (a flashy playlist in other words...) of the latest and greatest tracks upped to Altrap as well as some Top Ten playlists, Tracks of the Week and whatever else you guys would recommend having on a Channel such as this. That is, of course, if you guys think this is even a good idea in the first place. 

Any and all feedback would be appreciated. 

Oh, and here's the link for the first [Official r/Altrap Top Ten Mixtape](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1676E958B18BDAE9) as chosen by you guys.

All I'm saying is that guys like Sage, Sole, Aesop, Slug, El-P etc. are not young dudes and won't be around forever.
So every year XXL magazine comes out with a list of up and coming artists who are predicted to make it big in mainstream hip hop and sometimes they are pretty spot on.
I was just wondering if you guys thought having a yearly Alt Rap equivalent of Freshmen Class would be good for the scene. i feel like this would keep alt rap fans looking towards the future of the genre and would help support all the talented young cats on the scene making noise.  Do you think something like this would lead to growth and keep the scene fresh ?"	t5_2s66x	True

Now, don't get me wrong, I understand bad songs should be slowly buried but with a small community like altrap, if the person who hears it downvotes, it doesn't give much life to the track posted.
