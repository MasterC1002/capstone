I am dreapsp/frontalspy and here I have uploaded a large chunk of anime images I have collected over the past year or so. There are over 13,000 anime wallpapers- all of which would be over 1024x768 with some even at 4000x2500. And then I have an additional 3,000+ other anime images, which are not wallpapers and are more general images, gifs and official scans. In total, there is about **16gb** worth of anime images that I have uploaded, and it isn't all I have. Most of the anime wallpapers I have gotten are from dumps and bundles, and there *will* be duplicates even though I have used a software to sort that out. 

Anyways, I have decided to be a good person and upload my images to various filesharing and image hosting sites, namely Mega, Mediafire, Minus, Imgur and Torrent. So without further-ado, here are the links:

*****
**Download Links**

* **Mediafire:** All parts are split up into ~200mb parts so there are quite a number of things to download. The parts are all separate so you don't need any software to join them up.

 [**Medifire Link**](http://www.mediafire.com/?w49fti6qyne9es5,jumco6akxv6vo38,87bu2zlbr7jvsk7,ndr31jkmwwuh4d8,qt4h7n4bllho9e1,nkqu616agv6l611,8heeakvapxfnbyz,ss2ufj73sz2b897,83wcopizdhlvi33,dp7csds2s6mam05,41oqng4lnbea6lr,i3rq5wef5orlpld,5yw190icvjg36kr,u3jsckkr2qjg1cs,uu4ikstxfz5cr44,xa7qqu7uzp4l8gt,1m7jiwp1772hl76,9hcga1hhf3vj7bt,8if6u6qqn3jj111,d0jggt7wubx855u,4bq764jz5k5f36z,b42069n6afkbx2i,zb9vwpnddbq2hdm,xr5wszdeicu4bbd,0ut2042qod5o8c5,2tg0spriixupqgd,b7bej1deh6plrtc,m0yzffca0r4wr4d,q15qg9iueau3ibg,kevk71x9dkedu1g,gnjeygpt7c77n8c,wpt15mmm74qbqsh,pby49zz7ck7dxa0,lhvyfsua1y6bkku,jcnzb4921r2mn42,kw8tdntf2ki11hd,7i71abxc215s7hp,bb5w0wymlxwbtdh,w4h07ps50aaydd3,9j5605i9ppq1zw3,dmrwiq0ja1659q5,f9e6h97c66sr3dk,chv68nk1nbdu5ok,hpvsssoj2c8la2c,iyuymqrpapbw9ks,uurq6s9ypn3b193,g5bm2h8o3xp7pm7,tm4nf4ntjymdlr7,ft0x6nrid256mau,5dgo8nl6b85v3bv,i9qxxuexqr527x3,d6603pguvapee6f,fockqc17cwnsyfw,ydhd7rg8ort0utd,65x975ygu8glmwb,37ow2o5u8o4x7vg,bbfb4p7sdij9blq,kctvmr5n963pgs6,5d9vvmnw2llxzox,ndtdbpexhzlvip5,bvqfej8ajxzfobu,nt0lc2wdm5fg741,ww2l0zgma4lz69l,bkn8mmxri3533vc,j2cwlans7nqz3lr,wh3z4u5tbw61ptw,uxtmqkcb2z0c1j0,3a7we55ewdcfqo8,2aymrcdcxkipav4,anptndpaneckmsn,6mrb0447i287wce,yog638rj75j7bnc,t9dq28p4etqhy50,tpgp93t21im4our,xe3g893o8hquea3,w4qn9l8b2fq3n6u,dzvda9cfi6c8za2,bakxk1ki3348m8t,29y52kosj7s1gb2,7tsf2abjxhpppa2,2yxb7u9wh328225,m088mnpyq6bbfz8,xl0d047ooetyloh)
                  


* **Mega:** All links are split up into 1000 images, unless each part is less than 1,000 images.

 [**Mega Link**](https://mega.co.nz/#F!ex5xQDSA!SF4irFgTP_VHsr0TIFXERw)

* **Minus:** There are two different profiles; one has all the anime wallpapers and the other have all the other anime images since I would hit the 10gb upload limit. As of now, the second profile - the other images- isn't fully uploaded yet and will be so in the next few days. The images are all separated into 300 images per album (the limit) and if you want to download all the images, use [DownloadThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/) on Firefox.

 [**Anime Wallpapers** (13,000+)](http://frontalspy.minus.com/uploads)

 [**Other Anime Images** (3,000+)](http://frontalspy1.minus.com/uploads)      

* **Imgur:** My Imgur folder is the least up to date, with about 5,000 uploaded thus far. I have a slow upload speed to Imgur for some reason. Each album is at 125 images since Imgur has issues with large amounts of images. Imgur will be the slowest service to be updated due to the upload issues so bare with me.  
 [**Imgur Link**](http://frontalspy.imgur.com/)

* **Torrent:** If you want to download everything nice and easy, use this torrent link. I will be seeding this for the next few weeks but my upload speed is rather poor. It seems I cannot link Torrents so, if you want to obtain the torrent links visit my Minus page. The link will be in the description.

And that is all I have for now. If you want to know how many anime images I have in total, it is:  
 *17.69 GB on disk (17,609,744,313 bytes) for 38,687 items*

*****
**Frequently Asked Questions**

1. What anime is *X* from?

 I would have almost no idea which anime the image would be from. Your best bet would be to do a reverse google image search to find out where the image is from and what anime it is from, if any at all. I am sorry that I probably can't help you but the anime specific ones, ie. the images that are labeled, should be fine.

2. Why are there many images that appear more than once?  
  There are bound to be duplicates since most of the wallpapers are from numerous dumps. In the image hosting sites, especially with Minus I have more control in removing duplicate images since I see which ones are being uploaded 300 at a time, opposed to shifting through 13,000 images. I have used a program that identified similar images which removed about 600 images, but there are about 100 duplicates left. I am sorry that I don't remember which images I have downloaded and cannot get rid of the images. 

3. I am thinking of sharing your links, would I need to credit you?
 No need, at the most just link them to this post. At the very least, I want you all to share these images and albums to as many people as you want. You can post this on /a/, anime forums, facebook, anywhere and don't need to credit me in any way. I just want to spread the love."	t5_2qh22	True

My collection has almost doubled since then so here's an update. I'll try to answer any questions people may have about what series the pictures are from. Keep being an awesome community!

[Part 1](http://minus.com/mMHd3b6qVCZUO)  
[Part 2](http://minus.com/mIw5D9OtvMavj)  
[Part 3](http://minus.com/mbehzkfB74ryru)  

~~Edit: For those asking for the entire collection (approx 1.6GB), I'm sorting everything by shows on my dropbox so comment/PM and I'll send you the link. =)~~

~~Edit 2: Wow, I didn't think so many people would want the entire collection. Currently uploading a zip file to mega.co.nz, I have really slow Internet so I'll update when it's up (5 hours?). It'll be sorted by anime series.~~ 

~~Edit 3: Slow and steady, my Internet keeps crashing on me so I have to upload it in parts. If anyone else can upload them faster than I can that would be awesome. I promise to message everyone who has commented/PM me when the full collection is up. I accidentally uploaded them slightly out of order, but there will be 4 parts in total.~~

Edit 4: Special thanks to [afriendlysortofchap](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1b94ed/a_year_later_my_collection_of_high_quality_anime/c94yr7g) for putting a torrent together with the files. You can get it [here](http://ge.tt/6udobXc/v/0?c) or from [TPB](https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8317320).  
~~About an hour left for the last part to be uploaded to mega. I'm assuming the links work? This is my first time using it.~~ 

Final Edit: Phew, and that's the end of my monthly bandwidth. The entire collection finally uploaded and good to go. If you are downloading via Mega, all wallpapers have been sorted by series. Let me know if the links stop working/broken. Thanks for waiting!

1375969681.0	1jydwn	you love anime.. or do you?	postblitz	991	261	411	"[this post is about community interaction](https://images.puella-magi.net/7/72/Photoshop_interview_with_madoka_and_homura.jpg), specifically the topic of subverting your fellow anime viewer.

i feel the need to write this down because some people might not be aware of the negative influence their comments have on the experience of new audience to shows they might sincerely love and wish to promote.*

let's say you're a big fan of anime X. anime X has good value on its own but has certain moments that took you by surprise and you had no idea they were coming. the sheer impact of said moment, cheaply named ""shock value"", is the result of a carefully constructed trap the plot worked hard to provide: 

- you're eased into a feeling of comfort with the way the scenario is unfolding and your best educated guesses fall into the range of predictability the authors were counting on.

this is where the problem arises. when promoting their favourite/beloved anime series some viewers feel the need to point out in some way that the plot does not fall into the regular case and thus break the illusion the show wanted to construct so diligently. 

quotes used for this often include

- let me know what you think after episode Y
- wait until you get to the end of Z arc.
- pun/funny-witty retort around T scene which gives away huge amounts of plot.

after hearing this, the person you recommended the anime to is prepared for something unexpected to happen and never bothers to lower their guard.. meaning any appeal that moment may have had for you is gone. after that, **even if the show's quality may appeal to them..they will never have the same love for the show you do because you've subverted their experience.**

and then there's hype.. since it may not even be a single moment, it could be the entire experience being subverted since the shock value may lie in overall quality. once you prepare someone with high expectations you immediately break any chance for them to see the show starting from a blank slate. you may not even be specific, just overtly excited and obvious about your intentions

methods to avoid such hasty and counter-productive things are:

- lie to them: X is about cute girls doing cute things
- appeal to their confidence in your taste: just trust me, watch X. 
- point out a secondary appeal factor the show may have: it's only 12 episodes long, it has amazing art, the VAs give their all to flesh out the characters.
- mention you gave that show a 10/10 or 9/10.. but do not tell them why.

i realize some people may just feel proud having seen a show and knowing the story and what happens in it but [please try to hold it in](http://i.minus.com/iKURNy7Stf8L8.gif) and **advertise responsibly**. if you come across people saying a critically acclaimed, fan-favourite and your most beloved series is mediocre/shit/bland/*okay*/nothing special you can be certain that opinion is most often* a product of [reckless hype](http://i.minus.com/ioFHkFy14VR9l.gif) rather than their inability to comprehend the appeal.

**please do your best to let people form their own independent opinion** and then flood them with [your own.](http://i.imgur.com/gp0cmOh.gif)

\* most often because subjective taste does come into play as well, just not nearly as often."	t5_2qh22	True

1345864367.0	ysgh2	In 2003, I decided to move to Japan and follow my crazy dream of working in the anime industry.  I eventually became a director.  AMA!	KyaroHime	707	127	252	"Throughout high school and college, I had a secret longing to pursue a career in anime, but I brushed aside this fantasy for a long time because I had been raised to believe that art was only a hobby.  After finishing grad school and making my parents happy, I decided it was time to make myself happy.  I moved to Japan (from the US) having no clue how to break into the anime industry, but I was determined to make it work!  After asking some of my Japanese friends, they suggested I look into some anime schools.  I got a job teaching English to support myself, enrolled in anime school, and after two years, interviewed at a small studio where I was hired as an assistant animator.  After a year of working hard to prove myself, I was promoted to episode director for the series, ""Doraemon.""  AMA.

EDIT:  Gonna take a break and get some food.  Will be back to answer more 
questions soon!

**UPDATE:**  Thought I'd answer some of the FAQs...
  
* The show that inspired me to move to Japan:  The Vision of Escaflowne
  
* Favorite anime:  Ghibli (Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Grave of the Fireflies), FMA Brotherhood, Seirei no Moribito, Death Note... currently hooked on One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, and Bakuman.

* What I'm doing now:  I left Japan in late 2006 because the work conditions were draining my will to live.  After returning to the US, I worked for a few years at a company that produced 2D animated commercials and web cartoons.  There, I met my now husband (yes... I'm a girl!!) and I'm now working on my own animation and art projects in the hopes of starting up our own studio.  We want to combine all the best components of what we love about Western cartoons and Japanese anime and make something really kick-ass.

**UPDATE 2:**  It's 3am PST.  Bed time!  I'll be back tomorrow to answer more questions.  Thanks for the great conversation!    

**UPDATE 3:**  Some of you have expressed interest in learning how to make anime.  This has inspired me and my husband to consider making some ""how to anime"" DVD tutorials.  If a tutorial existed, what would you want to learn specifically?  PM me with your suggestions!  "	t5_2qh22	True

(You might want to sit down, I'll be here a while)

I'd put off watching this second season for a decent while, for two very specific reasons. First, while I found the first season very unique and artistically compelling, it didn't really resonate with me at all until that last, basically perfect episode. And second, from everything I'd read online, it seemed like the second season amped the fanservice up to 11. And fanservice, well...

It's bad. The way it's normally used, it demeans and objectifies characters, and distracts/detracts from whatever a show is trying to do narrative-wise and emotionally. It makes the camera itself a lecherous observer of characters, and not simply the best framing device for the story being told. It adds to a value unrelated to a show as an artistic work, and in fact normally detracts from its artistic worth and the narrative/emotional weight of any scene. It demeans the *audience* as well, implying we're unable to be entertained by the show's actual worth, and the implications regarding my base-instinct-oriented nature colors my experience as a viewer. It proves that the creators of the show are not taking that show and its characters seriously – and if they're not, why the fuck should I?

However

Nisemonogatari is not interested in fanservice.

Nisemonogatari is a show *specifically about* sexuality, perspective, and the conventions of camera use (yeah, I know it's not an actual camera, bear with me).

Most fan service happens by making the camera take the perspective of an outsider, an intruder to the scene – or at “best” the perspective of the lecherous or hapless protagonist. Fan service is all about the male gaze, that is, women are framed in a way that accentuates their sexuality not because that's how they see themselves, but *just because the cameraman finds that sexy.*

In Nisemonogatari, the cameraman has got greater concerns than that. Every shot is purposeful, and from a specific perspective or mentality.

Example 1: the scene with Nadeko.

In this scene, Nadeko is specifically and obviously trying to seduce the oblivious Araragi. To that end, *Nadeko is in control of the camera*. The camera is portraying her exactly how she wants to be perceived, and most of the humor of the scene is drawn from the contrast between her fumbling, obvious advances and Araragi's upbeat obliviousness. This is the first of many scenes where a female character attempts to use her sexuality as a weapon, and Araragi's responses make it clear that the camera is not from his male perspective – it is portraying the way she is attempting but failing to be perceived. Additionally, this is the first of countless scenes where almost all the emotional content of the exchange is contained in the *direction*, not the script. This isn't surprising, considering this show is directed by the great  Akiyuki Shinbo, but it's clear even this early that Shinbo has a bone to pick with the way anime portrays sexuality, and his superior, winking control of the camera's eye comes up again and again.

Let's run through a few more examples. The next scene, Araragi meets his sister, and this is completely unsexualized – in fact, they even go so far as to incorporate a traditionally grossly fanservicey shot (a crotch shot), but because of her outfit and stance, it's totally neutral. At this point in time, neither of these characters consider the other sexually at all, so why would the camera? Shinbo knows what many directors fail to either know or care about – that the positioning of the camera both has a significant emotional effect on the viewer, and *always conveys information*. Information about tone, about self-image, about stakes, about the way one character views another... anime is a medium with literally infinite framing potential, and Shinbo is going to talk about that whether the viewer likes it or not.

The next scene we're with Kanbaru, and it's back to “fanservice” - but the context is entirely different from the Nadeko scene. In this sequence, it's a girl using her body to deliberately fuck with Araragi, because that's the rapport they share. Unlike Nadeko, there is no subtlety in Kanbaru's sexuality, both because that's more representative of her in-your-face personality, and because she just knows Araragi better. She uses her sexuality as a weapon, not to seduce Araragi, but to simply throw him off guard. But again, she is entirely in control of the camera's eye.

Skipping ahead, we have an episode where Shinobu is naked basically the entire time, but the tone and impression are completely different. The camera trivializes her nudity because to her, it is trivial – it is not sexualized, and is treated in a way very similar to Horo from Spice and Wolf – it doesn't shy away from it, but also doesn't fetishize or draw attention to it. Meanwhile, in a brief conversation with a fully clothed Hanekawa, the camera is *all about* the character's sexuality. This is because Hanekawa is an inherently seductive presence to Araragi, and they both know it – the sexual tension just barely unacknowledged between them is apparent in the camera's eye. Again, all these scenes contain the majority of their context simply in the framing of the character – while their conversations are more whimsical and plot or banter-focused, a *huge* amount of information about the relationship the characters share is conveyed through the camerawork alone. Intelligent cinematography is like a freaking superpower.

And now we get to the big one.

Episode 8. Dental hygiene. The last great point of this series.

To me, firstly, this episode is goddamn hilarious. The primary joke of the second half is, “brushing teeth should not be this sexy,” and that joke only works if the audience can feel how sexy it is for those characters. And this team is obviously gifted enough to know how to pull off a scene like that.

And that's impressive enough on its own. But what I really think this episode is doing, what I think the point is from the beginning straight through the end, is talking about Intimacy.

I think, and this is pure hypothesis, but it seems pretty reasonable to me, that Shinbo asked himself, “what do people who love fanservice get out of it? Why are they watching an anime, and not just porn? What does this show have that actual direct sexual gratification lacks?”

Intimacy.

The toothbrush scene is so erotically charged because of the *intimacy* involved, and everything in the show/episode leads into this. First, Karen and Araragi's relationship always has a weird, semi-flirtatious charge to it, as they've moved from younger traditional antagonistic siblings to one of those bicker-flirting couples. Then, everything Karen does at the start of this episode is designed to put Araragi off his guard and in a place of intimacy/discomfort. Her outfit does so much work here, and it's all *her intentional, meaningful decision.* First, it serves as a striking contrast against both her normal outfit and her personality – the bee exercise outfit is absolutely *her*, androgyny is absolutely *her*, carefree sexlessness is absolutely *her*, and putting her in such a constricting, gendered, sexually charged outfit serves to throw off all preconceptions Araragi has about interacting with her. Second, the fact that it isn't her outfit, and in fact doesn't fit her at all, puts her in a place of *vulnerability*, and this also throws off Araragi. Finally, it directly is designed to be sexy, and prove she's in control of her sexuality, which is something Araragi has clearly been struggling to come to grips with as he attempts to act like a role model for his sisters. All of these things further Karen's goals in this episode – make Araragi so uncomfortable he'll agree to introduce her to Kanbaru. All these are choices of the *character*, not the learing cameraman, and the effect these choices have on both Araragi and the audience is very much the *intended effect*. Everything else she does – the confession about how his insults used to really get to her, her basically physically assaulting him – all these further that one clearly understood goal.

But I was talking about intimacy. So, what the actual toothbrush scene does obviously builds off this place of discomfort/vulnerability/overt sexuality she's been intentionally provoking. It combines this with the relationship these two have been building, a great deal of bantering buildup, and a close monologue from Araragi to place the sex stuff in a position of complete *emotional honesty*. Sure, it's also played for humor – but the humor is mostly based on the fact that it's funny brushing teeth can be this sexy, and as I said, for that joke to work at all, the audience has to truly understand that *this scene is sexy to these characters*. Most powerful moments in most media are powerful not just because of the audience's emotional reaction to a situation, but because they can empathize with a character's emotional reaction to a situation. This effect drags us further into the text/film/show and girders our connection with the characters involved – at that moment, we feel for them more deeply than we do for ourselves. Thus, all the prep work of this episode works to help us understand these characters completely at this moment, and when they react to this scene as if it's incredibly erotic, we can understand it to be erotic as well. The connection between the characters is honest, and the way the show is conveying their emotions to the audience is honest as well – *intimacy* is really just another word for *honesty*. This honesty, which makes this scene so strong, is a part of why most fanservice is so bad – because it's dishonest to the characters, and portrays them as sexual objects when they're not actually feeling like sexual objects in that moment. But more than that, this honesty is almost entirely lacking in conventional pornography. Conventional pornography is generally a collection of soul-deadened actors performing a service for a fee – sure, they're naked, but it's the furthest thing from intimacy you could possibly imagine. To find someone disrobe *emotionally*, you have to look to art. And so the point of this scene is ""Even in a scene as ridiculous as this, honesty can make it ring true.""

One last tangent, but it was very interesting to me, and I never would have thought of it if not for the strong points raised by Nisemonogatari. I think this intimacy issue is a large part of why something like K-On is so damn successful. This is a kind of fractured and difficult point to make, mainly because the characterization in K-On is very difficult to describe as “honest,” but I think *from the point of view that these are valid characters*, K-On attempts to create a continuous mood of emotional honesty and friendly, unabashed intimacy. It invites the viewer into a safe, loving environment free from any of the hidden motives and defenses that characterize the real world, and is always completely honest with the viewer. For those who watch Community, K-On is basically like the ultimate Abed experience – a world based on rules you understand entirely that loves you unconditionally, and is willing to share all of its emotional secrets with you. Intimacy porn. I mainly bring this up because there was a thread a few days ago where someone said they like K-On because the characters feel “real.” Now, to anyone who knows anything about character writing or, frankly, human beings, that's a ridiculous statement – but I think what was really meant there was that the characters feel *honest*, which, though they are very fabricated constructions, is certainly true within the context of that show.

So yeah, the toothbrush scene forced me to reevaluate and perhaps legitimize the emotional appeal of “cute girls doing cute things”. And I think that's exactly the point Shinbo was trying to make – that sex will never be as appealing as honesty, and that intimacy is ultimately the core of the erotic. And that this, in addition to the issues about male gaze, camerawork, storytelling, and perspective he's already addressed, is why fanservice normally hurts shows - it's impersonal and dishonest.

So no, I don't think Nisemonogatari is a big fan of fanservice. In fact, I think it's the ultimate, staggeringly coherent statement against it, complete with endless demonstrations of the ways sexuality really can be used to enhance and augment storytelling. And I could not be more freaking impressed.

Why do so many people dislike mecha, to the point where they feel like it's necessary to specify their dislike when asking for recommendations?

I find it quite hard to think of many mecha anime that aren't Gundam and Macross, to be honest. Code Geass, TTGL, and Evangelion are no doubt the biggest three. Other shows that come to mind would be... Eureka Seven, Escaflowne, Rinne no Lagrange, MuvLuv...? At this point I'm tempted to mention Infinite Stratos to pad out my list because it's so damn short.

Good mecha anime are popular. Bad mecha anime are obscure, more so than bad shows of other genres. So what gives?

* Mecha isn't even that popular of a genre; how and why do people decide they don't like it?
* If a person has seen mecha anime and decided they don't like it, where are they finding these bad mecha shows? The most popular mecha anime are popular enough that I don't think they'd cause many people to develop a distaste of the genre.
* If a person hasn't seen any mecha anime, what leads them to be wary of the genre despite that? I suppose it does have a bit of a stigma, possibly stemming from some of the Gundam series, but shouldn't the popularity of Evangelion et al overwrite this?"	t5_2qh22	True

* [**Preoders Update**](http://i.imgur.com/kS2eKPl.jpg)

Since EP6, the show traded the first two places with Eva 3.33 for a few days. Now it's #3, because [there are a few non-anime titles topping the chart.](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/bestsellers/dvd/ref=zg_bs_unv_d_1_16378461_1) 

This will make SnK get less stalker points per day, even if its pre-orders are steady/increasing/decreasing. 

Here's a very interesting analysis on the relationship between [Median Rank and Vol1Week1 Sales](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showpost.php?p=2023195&amp;postcount=678). **As long as SnK keeps ranking among the Top10, it will get at least 30k.**

* Preorders Update 2

An hour ago, Vol 2 rocketed itself into the Top 10 of the general chart. The highest it has been so far.

Disregard that, ALL BD VOLUMES are rising like Colossal Titans. [All of them are in the Top ~~40~~ 30 of Amazon's Best Selling BDs/DVDs now.](http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/index_news.cgi). 3 out of the 9 volumes in the TOP10.

And Vol 1 is getting a new wave of preorders: it has passed the [Maou J-drama](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Maou). Back at #2.

I don't know how well it worked for Little Busters! but let's try this idea on this very popular show.

**This thread is meant for people who's not familiar with the manga** and want a thread that feels safer and with less spoiler tags. Manga readers are welcome but, please, try to keep the discussion anime-only (avoid manga comparisons, manga in-jokes, adaptation complaints, teasing upcoming moments, etc).

I'll report spoilers as soon as I see them in my inbox.

* [**Preoders Update**](http://i.imgur.com/ChoEp4o.jpg)

Since EP5, the show has ranked between #4 and #2 for 4 consecutive days now and counting. Even if Amazon Stalker is predicting almost 70k BDs, a more realistic forecast sets it around 30k BDs + 10k DVDs. Which is still a lot, and this is only EP5 numbers. This is pretty exiting. It's like Production I.G. decided to ""save anime"".

EDIT:

**Some Trivia**

Here's a Translation Note that's about Eren's catchphrase ""I'll kill every single one of them"". He says in such a way that reinforces the pure hate he ~~feels~~ felt towards the titans.

&gt;""It's been going on for a while now but in Japanese, Eren's way of saying ""to the last"" -一匹残らず- (ippiki nokorazu), uses ""ippiki"" (一匹), which is a counter for small animals and bugs, instead of the more appropriate ""ittou"" (一頭), which covers the big ones. This is a means to convey his scorn."""	t5_2qh22	True
