They both fired right up with a quick prime and fairly quick boil times. I got 23 minutes of run time on the Pepsi Penny. Already threw some Ramen on there to test em out.

I found a [wool sweater](http://imgur.com/pBCXG) at a thrift store, a few sizes too big. I thought that I could shrink it down using some advice from MFA but when I started looking for socks online I had a great idea...

I present to you, [the ghetto wool socks](http://imgur.com/NX5J5).

I've been wearing them all day with boots, trying to stink them up and rough them up so I can figure out if they need more work. They have held up pretty nicely.

I did an odd trial today where I wore one ""work sock"" from walmart and one of these. The wool sock was much more comfy but it was much MUCH warmer than the other sock. This is good if you're out in the cold... but on a decent day this just meant sweaty feet.

How did I do it? I tried looking up tutorials. I found one on instructables but I didn't want to cut out the pattern so I winged it. Started with a tube, made changes from there. Ended up with these.

I didn't want to spend the money on a 'professionally' made hammock, but then I found this [thread at HammockForums](http://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=15205). I figured I'd give it a shot as my first MYOG project.

I built the hammock yesterday in about 4 hours (including a trip to the store for materials). I had expected the project to be a lot more difficult, but it was incredibly easy to make a gathered end hammock. Since no one else seems to have posted this link before, i thought I'd share.

If you read through the comments there are a couple of additional mods you could do to improve on the basic design (most complain the sides are too floppy) but it's hard to beat the simplicity. There's almost no reason NOT to make you're own hammock.

I have read ALOT of quilt guides, and im pretty sure i can do it. But im in doubt about the layout of the quilt.
Ive ordered 250 g app 9 ounze of 700 cuin down.
2,5 meters 10d nylon ripstop
2,5 meters 38 g / m2 nylon taffeta.

My questions are.

Shoud i baffel ? its going to have about 1,5-1,7 inch loft. Would it give extra insulation, or just more work ?

Should i do a foot box or just ad a strip of velcro so i can make the it if i need it. Im afraid the velcro might tear the fabric, or get filled up with dirt and stop working. I was thinking of addring just strings to tie it together, but im afraid the fabric won't hold.

Is it worth it in a summer quilt to ad a ""neck string"" like the [katabatic](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Reviews/Katabatic-Gear-Palisade) quilt has it.

Do you guys have attachment system to tie to quilt to the sleeping pad ? do you use it. is it needed on a summer quilt ?

I don't know anyone who have a quilt i can try out, i made a prototype from a fleece blanket, but it didn't answer all my questions, so i hope you can help me.

1348844504.0	10mcvq	Distill cheap vodka into ~95% ethanol for fuel?	sprashoo	16	1	15	"Just an idea that occurred to me, considering how hard it is to get non-denatured ethanol in most of the world (the stuff we get in the UK stinks, stains things purple, and leaves purple residue inside alcohol stoves.) The basic principle is that ethanol boils at ~78ºC, while water boils at 100ºC. Heat up a litre of cheap vodka to just over 78º, collect the condensed vapor, and you should have nearly pure ethanol. Right?

Or is this totally impractical? Obviously you'll want to monitor the temperature carefully and probably use a non-flame heat source just in case. I recall a setup like this from chemistry class - it seems like something that could be done at home?

http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/solut/solut-images/distillapp-plain.jpg

He showed me a ""dart"" he made for it. he was using half of a q-tip attached to a small nail via electrical tape. It worked well, but I felt we could improve on the design.

We decided to instead use the hollow plastic q-tips. We cut them in half. Using needle nose pliers we shoved 17 gauge wire brads into the hollow ends. They're the little nails with the ""round"" head on them rather than a ""flat"" head for those who don't know. That's all it takes!

Lick the cotton end of the q-tip to create breach pressure and stick it in the end of the barrel, then ram it down with a thin wooden dowel and you're ready to go! These darts are actually pretty accurate up to about 100' and I have driven countless nails so deep into trees that they couldn't be pulled out by hand.

For added fun, the q-tips can be dipped in glow stick fluid so you can shoot at night and see where the dart is going.

DISCLAIMER: I do not recommend you use a nice pellet gun for this, because you risk gouging the inside of the barrel. Also, the glow stick fluid will gunk everything up. We were both using a Crosman Pumpmaster 760 .177 Cal. They are about $30 at Wal-Mart.

So I salvaged two interior dividers from a large tent the other day. Each is a trapezoid and has plastic tie in things on each corner. If I attach each down its long/base edge, It'll make a decent hexagonal tarp.

My question to you is, how should I go about attaching the two. I leave for a trip on Thursday and would love to take it along to test. I've never sewn before and don't have much free time to learn, so unless it's incredibly easy, it'd would be tough to pull off. Thanks!"	t5_2sclk	True

so far i have only been working with lightweight ripstop nylon and want to branch out into some heavier material. i made a backpack out of the nylon, but i'd like to make another one that will be a bit more durable. i have been searching some, but it seems that every site describes the same thing a bit different. the only consistent thing i've found is that the price really jumps up with the weight. i'd rather not blindly spend $15 a yard when i'm not sure about what i'm getting.

1365389193.0	1bw61c	Troubleshooting Cat Food Alcohol Stove - Flames Up Pot Sides	birdsbirdsbirdsbirds	12	1	23	"Hey guys, I've been searching around without much result so I've decided to ask here. 

I just made my first two cat food can alcohol stoves (AKA Fancy Feast stoves). I used the first two templates from the [Supercat Stove Page](http://www.supercatstove.com/docs/SuperCat_HolePunchTemplates.pdf) to punch the holes (one template for each stove). I used the Disney Aristocat's brand cat food, and I'm using Sunnyside denatured alcohol as the fuel. This fuel is at least 96% ethanol and less than 4% methanol. 

I've used two different pots with similar results. The first is an Open Country 2qt aluminum pot with lid. The other is a MSR Titan Tea Kettle with lid. Ostensibly the flames-up-sides problem is worse with the Titan kettle. Both pots are filled with 2 cups cold water and stoves have just over 1oz fuel.

My problem is that the flames from the stove tend to reach up the sides of whatever pot I'm using. My burn times are pretty similar between stoves: 9min for the one with fewer holes, 10min for the one with more holes. Boiling times are consistently around 7:30min regardless of stove. I have been using a MYOG aluminum foil wind screen at varying levels of tightness, but the flames still come up the sides. 

*My guess would be the fuel isn't getting enough oxygen.* The stove with more holes burns longer and tends to have a more contained jet of flame - which makes me think fewer holes isn't getting enough air. Because most people using pots of both sizes (2L and 850ml) without this problem, I'm guessing it's not a pot issue. It might also be a fuel issue... Suggestions and advice from MYOGurus is much appreciated!

**TLDR**; Cat Food stove has marginal performance and flames frequently lick up sides of pot regardless of pot size. My guess is air flow problem. Halp plz!

Edit: I realize this could also be a non-issue, and everybody else with this stove experiences the same thing. If so, that would be nice to know too!

Double Edit: [Just took pictures of the process](http://imgur.com/a/GZ71o), including the windscreen at various levels of tightness. Thanks for all the suggestions so far!"	t5_2sclk	True

I have a nice late 80`s Buck 639v survival knife. After contacting BUCK and looking on ebay for a week i decided i would have to make my own sheath. 

Got the leather from a old leather coat that i picked up for 3 bucks from a thrift store. I choose it over 3 dollar leather boots because it was thinner. 

Cut the leather out with a knife and used a 10 dollar cheap-o rivet type squeeze gun to attach the circular rivets. Inserted a couple of rectangular pieces of craft knitting plastic for stiffness between the layers of leather. The backing is actually 2 pieces of leather with the strap piece and plastic in the middle. Same goes for the top cover over the blade. 

Sewn up with nylon saddle thread from the thrift store and coated with gorilla glue without adding water to the glue. Made a nice thick hard coat on the sheath and secured the nylon from being pulled off or fraying. 

I secure the strap with velcro. I have another piece of leather with huge snaps on it to add in the future as a 2nd strap for extra protection. 

The leather was really hard to sew. I used a finish nail at first to make the thread holes but eventually ended up getting a big ass needle and just forcing it thru. After stabbing my finger with the needle repeatedly i made a popsickle stick / gorilla glue thimble. =-)

Though I've been using homemade alcohol stoves for a while, I need a new pot.  I'm retiring my aluminum mess kit that's been used since my cub scout days 20+ years ago.  It's very bulky and a little too dented to sit stable on a stove or stand.  A nice fancy nonstick pot sounds great since I hate dish clean-up in the woods, but money is too tight for that sort of gear.

It looks like I missed the boat on the Heineken keg cans (I read they're no longer imported to the US).   I do have a few small coffee cans on hand though...  [This kind](http://i.imgur.com/AwcMD.jpg), to be precise.

The can appears to be steel, and is a great size for holding the rest of my kitchen gear.

Is it safe to use for boiling water?  Or will I leach nasty stuff out of the metal or seams?  I don't think it's galvanized.

Are there other cans in the size range (16-24 oz) that I should be using instead?

I use a steel can lid I hammered into a convex shape with the lip retained, and it will get the stove going with literally a few drops of fuel dripped into the pan (the fuel flows around and forms a ring that burns for 30 seconds or so). 

Trying to prime in the recommended way, from the top, requires a lot of fuel, and I frequently see it all burn off without the stove getting started...

One issue is that the burner ring on my stove is more or less flush with the top of the bottom can, not a little below, as recommended. This could contribute to the slow priming from the top. But going by the directions on the JureyStudio site, it sounds like a lot of fuel is required for priming (he suggests filling the top of the burner ring, which is a lot more than just a few drops).

I have searched around myog with no luck, but I was wondering if anyone has had experience with modifying backpacks to fit larger torsos? If I could add an inch beyond the largest fitting by just adding extensions at the tops of the shoulder straps, that would be great - but I am not sure if that is worth the effort or if it will skew the loading in the pack outside a comfortable range.

1351607541.0	12c7fu	Tips on cutting/drilling ferrocerium ('firesteel')	sprashoo	9	1	3	"I bought a cheap firesteel from eBay and it works great, but it's quite heavy and longer than I really need. I decided to remove it from the plastic handle and cut it in half, to have two short, lighter firesteels.

The material (ferrocerium) is similar to aluminum in hardness - it's easy to cut with a hacksaw, and pretty easy to drill as well. The issue is the sparks. Not only does cutting  cause sparking (which I was afraid would detemper the hacksaw blade edge), but you end up with a pile of super flammable dust beneath the cut, which eventually catches on fire and flares up.

The trick seems to be just to keep the cut wet - after that, no more fire problems! Same went for drilling.

Anyhow, I now have two mini firesteels: http://i.imgur.com/Bpebc.jpg

I plan to fix it by adding a grosgrain stip folded in half and sewn around each side of the seam (using a large zigzag pattern).  Is this sufficient to fix it? It seems like the double fold hem is mainly to prevent fraying.

Since I recently tore a hole in the stuff sack for my tent (and possibly a new one for my stakes as well), that was a logical first choice for something to make - I mean, it doesn't need to be anything amazing, it's just a bag to hold a tent. Stitch the bottom and side edge together, roll down a lip for the drawstring, boom. Done. I would like to reinforce the bottom with a second piece of ripstop, though, not sure if that would alter anything.    

The second thing I figure could be a sleeping bag liner, as I scored some stretchy UnderArmor-type fabric (I think it's mostly nylon with some poly and spandex) on clearance a while back. Probably similar process to the stuff sack, even down to the drawstring I suppose, to be able to cinch it up? I've never used a liner, so I don't know how practical it'd be, other than the practice of making it.

Eventually, I'd like to make some hex tarps and some customized hammocks. While I don't see myself getting to the point of making my own tent or pack, I'm not going to rule it out. That'd probably be a good ways away, though.    

So, any ideas for projects to hone sewing machine skills? I currently have just shy of 1 yard (59"" wide) green ripstop nylon, and just shy of 2 yards (59"" wide) grey ripstop nylon.

Around the perimeter of the trace Ill cut short rectangles ( wide end on the perimeter), again, to fit the curve of my foot best. These extra strips of sole are going to be where I anchor some sort of material to. 

Winter in Colorado is wet, and cold. I need a outer layer that is waterproof, and can take the occasional scuff on the sidewalk, rocks, whatever. I'd like the inner layer to be something warm....
Can anyone recommend a good materials for this?

If anyone is interested in hearing more, here it is.
Right now I'm thinking that the best way to secure this to my foot is with parachute chord. Some how laced near the bottom of my toes up to my upper ankles. Water can seep into cracks, so the point where the  ""tongue"" meets the upper part of the shoe will be close to my lower ankle area...
I'm going to hand sew everything together with some thick solid thread, then use shoe goo on the inside and out to seal up the cracks and hopefully hold everything together a little tighter.

Before I make a quilt, I need to try to fix some comfort problems.

The nylon material is very loud when I move around, especially when my whiskers rub against it. It wakes me up sometimes, if I move in my sleep. I have tried using a small fleece blanket over my shoulders and face, which works but it usually ends up underneath me by morning.

I am wondering if anyone else has this problem and how they fixed it.

I am thinking about sewing some fleece on the quilt where my face rubs it. Do you think this would work?


Another comfort issue is that there tend to be cold drafts near my shoulders if I don't use a fleece blanket. I know one solution is to wear something, like a long underwear top. Is there another way to stop drafts? I was thinking about sewing a piece of fleece so it hangs from the quilt to the ground as a draft stopper. I would also like something to hide my head and face under, at least for a while to warm up and get comfortable until my bed warms up.

One crazy idea, cut the quilt long enough so it is a foot past my head so it hangs down to the ground forming a good seal from outside air, and cut an opening in the quilt that my face fits through. I have not tried this, and don't know if it would be comfortable, but it should be warm.

Or maybe I should just get used to the noise and wear a shirt at night?"	t5_2sclk	True

I've been looking around, and there are kits I can buy to cut my own poles to length but.. I've been unable to find any schematics which actually give the pole length to begin with!

1366170519.0	1cif8l	Best Material (fabric) to make a bike Frame Bag (or backpack?	sixtyfootersdude	3	2	9	"Good Morning!

I am planning on making a frame bag for my mountain bike in the near future.  Bought some cardboard last night to make a mockup.  I was wondering: 

a) What is the best material to use to make a frame bag?  Where should I purchase it?  I could go to a faberick store but there is nothing super close.  Something online would work or local could too.  Where do you by fabric?  What would you recommend?  

b) I also need zippers, foam (to hold shape and add padding) and velcro.  Good online choice?

Other info: 

 - I have a standard sewing machine that I borrowed from a friend.  I was thinking I will probably also need to get scissors, needles, thread, but will I need a special needle for the sewing machine?  
 - In Canada, so something with Canadian shipping would be swell.

Priorities for fabric: 

* Easy to work with -&gt; Maybe in the future I will make another one with a better or heavier fabric.  THis is my first sewing project so something easier would be good.  

* Waterproof

* Easy to clean - mountain biking = mud

* Durable 

* Non stretch fabric

* Other things I haven't thought of

This is what a frame bag looks like: [Image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_BhBOJtgtve4/S21ls_znU2I/AAAAAAAADKI/IOu-48k4_Os/s400/IMG_4472.JPG).  The frame bag is the bag inside of the main triangle.  

** Note: My the bottom bracket (pedals) on my bike is higher than that bike and my top tube slopes down so the total size of my bag will probably be about half the size of the pictured bike.  "	t5_2sclk	True

Does anyone know/have experience with making transit bags for rucksacks?  Very large rucksacks in particular.  I work abroad and have used a [Berghaus Vulcan](http://store.berghaus.com/p/packs/mens-vulcan-rucksack/461218) for the last few years - fantastic rucksack, but it's very large.  I've bought transit bags in the past for flights, but the only bags you can get for something this big are rather flimsy and last 2 flights at the best before they're so torn up I have to buy a new one.  It's worth the money - I'd rather they get torn up than my pack, but I'd like a more permanent solution.  I've seen duct-taping all the seams of the transit bag to really toughen it up as a solution, but that doesn't seem like it would help all that much.

I have dyspraxia, so I've always been terrible at making things, but if there's a template for making some kind of transit cover like this maybe I could twist the arm of a friend with a sewing machine to help guide my hand a little ;)

1371684097.0	1gov0e	Trying to locate 1.9 oz Ripstop for hammock DIY running into some issues. Anyone who has gone down this path and can lend some advice, please do	elevatedmovemENT	2	2	4	"I seem to be running into a translation error when talking to fabric stores.  When I ask if they carry 1.9 oz they transfer me to someone else or say something along the lines of, ""I don't know, we have stuff that feels like plastic, does that work?""

I want to be careful about ordering anything from afar before I order because if its not the right fabric I'm SOL.  

Anyway to get the point across, or do any of you know a trusted vendor?  I've looked at DIY gear supply, but I can see that there are vendors that offer ripstop nylon at around $3/yrd and I want to avoid paying more than that if possible.  

If they don't have the Denier rating or weight listed, is there a way to test it to find out?  I dont want to go into a store and do it by touch just to end up with a 1.3 oz that rips on the first trip..
