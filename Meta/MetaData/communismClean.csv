1371771136.0	1gremb	Brazil's protests have become fascist	starmeleon	278	88	163	"Hello comrades.  

I am here to give you information about what is currently going on in Brazil. I am brazilian, born and raised in the city of São Paulo, where I am currently speaking to you from.  

The first thing I will tell you is that you should not pay attention to what the rest of reddit is telling you about the protests, and from what I hear comrades around the world telling me about their media reports, do not listen to them either.  

The protests which are currently going on are severely dynamic, but they have taken a definite turn towards fascism.  

The context of the protest is as follows:  

The initial wave of protests were organized by the MPL, Movimento Passe-Livre, which is an autonomist anarchist movement, based primarily in public universities. [Their main goal is and always was free, public funded transportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_public_transport). The protests were organized in response to (left-wing, social democrat/liberal PT Worker's Party) mayor Fernando Haddad's and (right-wing, conservative, social democrat in name only PSDB governor) Geraldo Alckimin's hikes in bus and metro fares.  

The protests were instantly joined by communist parties PSTU, PSOL and PCB. The MPL, due their anarchist ideology, denounced party participation. This will become important later on.  

The media, at first, launched a total offensive against the protests, accusing it of vandalism, and of being made-up by extreme leftists. [This is a prime example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=luLzhtSYWC4). They justified the actions of the armed Military Police of Brazil (which is a Gendarme), which was, at the time, shooting rubber bullets at people's faces (which is lethal), beating up primarily women, using lots of tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the movement, as well as several intimidation tactics, such as baseless arrests (including the famous arrests for vinegar posession).  

The media realized that despite all of their efforts, the movement had a popular agenda and had been garnering support accross progressive sections of the population. [One very popular ultra-conservative pig-loving anchor attempted to ask the extremely loaded question to his viewers: do you support vandalism in ongoing protests?](http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/p480x480/600742_502485453138395_1652625808_n.jpg) only to have his primarily reactionary audience humiliate him live by voting yes. The media, realizing they could no longer discredit the movement, and noticing that their most reactionary viewers were ready to take the street, switched strategies.  

[As I predicted in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1ggzfy/stand_up_with_the_proletarians_of_brazil_spread/cakfwgv), the raging anti-communist pundit [withdrew his previous opinion and started favoring the protests](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/comentaristas/arnaldo-jabor/2013/06/17/AMIGOS-EU-ERREI-E-MUITO-MAIS-DO-QUE-20-CENTAVOS.htm), but also started claiming that the protests were about ""much more"", and started to tell his viewers that the protests were about the long running list of anti-leftist complaints that were traditionally presented by the media against the left leaning worker's party and used electorally by the right-wing PSDB. The rest of the media did exactly the same thing. They even set up the narrative on the [international level, using this video that became the means through which reddit became aware of the protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AIBYEXLGdSg). This would later serve to legitimize the fascist coup in the eyes of the international audience.  

Now here is the tricky part. As I said in a [previous post about that particular video](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1ggzfy/stand_up_with_the_proletarians_of_brazil_spread/cak6y5g) you will notice that there is nothing intrinsically socialist about the video. Socialists, just as much as conservatives, are loathe to corruption, wasteful spending and the degradation of public services. HOWEVER, this has to be looked at in the context that the media has built over the years that the semi-leftist PT government has been in the presidency of the country.  

Maybe one example most socialists here will be more familiar with is the [Venezuelan media and it's participation in the attempted 2002 coup against Hugo Chavez, who was a friend to pink-tide brazilian president Lula who was current president Dilma's predecessor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZajyVas4Jg). What was the Venezuelan media's strategy? To constantly pound on the viewer's minds the idea that all leftism is corrupt, to fabricate accusations daily and to create the general feeling of constant crisis. The same has been absolutely true of Brazilian media since 2000.  

In fact, Rede Globo, which has the near-monopoly of TV audiences, which is owned by the billionaire heirs of Roberto Marinho, who had a personal fortune of 60 billion dollars, had previously attempted in 2007 to spark an [artificial ""popular"" march against the PT government led by several celebrities on its payroll](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimento_C%C3%ADvico_pelo_Direito_dos_Brasileiros).  

[**I SHOULD ALSO STRONGLY REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE 1964 MILITARY COUP WAS PRECEDED BY A MILLION STRONG REACTIONARY MARCH ON THE STATE OF GUANABARA ASKING FOR FASCISM AGAINST THE REFORMIST SOC-DEM JOÃO GOULART**](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcha_da_Fam%C3%ADlia_com_Deus_pela_Liberdade). So to those who are simply enamoured by any public protest thinking its impossible that the right can muster popular support, stop being so fucking naive.  

Now, you're probably asking, ""how can you suggest that the current protests are fascist? You're out of your mind!"". Well you are reading this and you are probably not in Brazil, watching how giddy the media is with the whole thing. You are probably not aware that the agenda against ""corruption"" was [suggested by the military chief of police when negotiating with MPL](http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/brasil/sp/2013-06-17/comandante-geral-da-pm-sugere-politizacao-de-protestos-em-sao-paulo.html) You are also probably not aware that the large majority of the opposition to the Worker's Party does not come from the radical left, as I wish it did, as MPL does, but it comes from PSDB and half of their electors are nostalgic of our fascist dictatorship. So they are going out there and [asking for a new one](http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/q71/s720x720/972005_274587252681267_195263270_n.jpg).  

The sign says ""military intervention now. For the *democratic* government of civilians and military"" which is, I'm sure, how he remembers the 1964-1986 period to be.  

As I write this, thousands of right wing militants are [**BURNING RED FLAGS**](http://imgur.com/hHL7oPo) in Paulista Avenue and demanding the impeachment of brazilian president Dilma Roussef. These militants are those who think that democracy only exists when married to neoliberalism, so in her place they want to install PSDB or the brazilian equivalent of Pedro Carmona.  

Many leftists are only now waking up to this fact, there have been some interesting attempts to make people aware of the oncoming fascist coup by [some artists](http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/p480x480/936406_251728094965815_2063686524_n.jpg), which are [conscious](http://www.pirikart.com.br/image/53331393870) of the media and right wing hijacking of the initial protests.  

Context: The toucan is the mascot for the right wing party. The other comic shows how the protest's agenda was hijacked by right wing demands.  

Now, the leftist parties have attempted to reclaim their movement and to fight against the reactionary agenda which always masquerades as ""apolitical"" demands for the moralization of politics. The right wing and the media have as such appropriated the anarchist ""anti-party"" discourse to denounce the left-wing in the protests, and some radical right wingers are demanding the extinction of parties, much like the 1964 military dictatorship proceeded to do. MPL and the anarchists are failing to react to this and are fueling the right wing rhetoric.  

There are also sections of the left which are too isolated in their group of friends and comrades to realize that the majority of people participating in the marches are not their friends. The majority of people joined in after the calls of reactionary media pundits. In many cities which the protests were not started by the left the protests are solely about the right wing protesting against left-politics. Do not be naive, communists would not gather up and protest near [former president Lula's house](http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/manifestantes-protestam-perto-da-casa-de-lula-em-sao-bernardo-8739640).  

Meanwhile, the Federation of Industries of São Paulo State (a business owner union, if there was ever full fascism in an organisation, its this one) is [supporting the protests](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTydPLKxUbw). The brazilian Pedro Carmona sharpens his fangs.  

So I find it extremely upsetting that clueless redditors, especially those who claim to be socialist inclined, are basically providing international support for a fascist coup.  

So when the judiciary, which the media has built up as the great moralizing institution, its hero being the Supreme Court Justice Joaquim Barbosa, does some kind of maneuver to oust the left-leaning Dilma Roussef in favor of elections or whatever that bring back the neo-liberal PSDB to power, the international community will be ready to validate the coup. I should remind you all that this is the [textbook tactic of 21st century fascism, as taught to us by Honduras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_constitutional_crisis).  

Brazil is in danger of going fascist, and I am sick of clueless foreigners which find out about what is going on through some stupid youtube video sponsored by some think tank like the Millenium Institute or by the brazilian equivalent of Miami Cubans and think that this is an overall positive development.  

Reddit disgusts me.

1356391049.0	15e9cd	Twas the night before Christmas...	MrMcAwhsum	135	45	23	"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the land,  
The workers were stirring - the time was at hand!  
The councils were meeting, more attended than ever;  
The masses were ready -uprise now or never.  
The people were angry and prepared to fight,  
Cries of ""Revolution!"" rang into the night.  


And all of my comrades from Council 19,  
Both Party and movement and all inbetween,   
Took to the streets and rose up in a clatter,  
Bourgeois illusions were thoroughly shatterred.  
We marched down Bay Street with our fists in the air,  
Then a cadre behind me set off a flare.  


We knew by the light that it was time to go,  
So we donned our face masks, just partly for show.  
We shouldered our weapons- some rifles, some sticks;  
Disorganised comrades began throwing bricks.  
""The state's not a window""; this lesson we knew,  
Pigs fell back ahead, we advanced for round two.  


I thought back to our meeting some hours before,  
Where a communist comrade had taken the floor.  
""To Marx! To Hoxha! To Mao and to Lenin!  
To Engels! To Luxemburg! To Che and to Stalin!""  
we cheered all their names and pledged to create,  
A communist world by smashing the state.  


But now in the moment the pig lines had reformed,  
Bolstered by army; we'd been misinformed!  
I thought that the soldiers had all deserted,  
As into their ranks, comrades were inserted.  
But before me I saw, as clear as the day,  
Some soldiers had stayed and had entered the fray.  


I drew my last breath, I thought we were done.  
Political power; it grows from a gun.  
Without an army the people have nothing;  
Could it have been that the Party was bluffing?  
But to my delight, as more shots rang out,  
It was only the pigs who started to shout.  


As the confusion and piggies began to die down,  
From the army ahead we could hear a sound.  
Songs as red as the blood that the workers had shed,  
Were carried up-street and entered our heads.  
The song they were singing we knew right away,  
The Internationale had carried the day.  


And Council 19, we advanced again,  
The soldiers, we found, composed Council 10.  
The battle was won, the war just beginning.  
Against the state and the bosses we clearly were winning.  
Main Street had been cleared, our objective was won,  
In the distance I saw a rising red sun.  


But if this night sounds too good to be true,  
I'll pause and I'll say: It could happen to you!  
Nothing written above should seem like fiction,  
If anything it should be viewed as prediction  
The masses of workers are angry and waiting,  
The people just need some more agitating.  
And so I propose: get off your tush,  
As Lenin reminds us, history's worth a push!  "	t5_2qolz	True

1363826566.0	1ap9gy	There's a nice little cold war brewing in my high school. 		117	26	83	"Gee, where to start...

A few months ago, the majority of people at my high school first discovered that I was a communist. I usually bring socialist/communist books and wear an assortment of soviet pins every day. I even made a bust of Lenin in my sculpture class. It is of no surprise that many people took notice. My classmates would ask me softball questions about communism and things of that nature. They would always be surprised that the things they were taught in school were a lie (although, communist education was limited to one or two questions on a test.) Since more and more people were asking me questions, I could hardly keep track of them all. So I decided I would ""publish"" a one page communist newsletter that would hopefully shed light on the truth about communism. 

The first newsletter was about capitalism. It just layed out all of the problems with capitalism and all of the harm it causes to the workers and the environment (for the ""green"" kids that were reading.) Apparently, a student or two showed an economics and history teacher. The rat who showed the teacher said that the teacher called my paper ""shit communist propaganda."" I don't have to telly you, but that really rustled my jimmies. 

My second newsletter was about the fundamentals of communism and debunking its misconceptions. Since those two papers have been released, history and economics teachers have been stepping up there anti communist lesson plans. More and more people come up to me and repeat the lies their teachers have shoved down their throats, i try to resist the best i can. Things have become very interesting around my high school and most of the teachers in my grade have heard of me and my ""cause."" 

I am *very* excited to see what is going to happen next...

The thread that was made at the time in r/socialism, along with the liberal population of r/socialism resort to sophistry in self-justification and charge that our criticisms of the ""subreddit of the whole people"" are allegations ""far removed from Marxism"", betray ""isolation from the discourse of r/socialism"" and are a demand that they ""return to the past"".
     
Well, let us ascertain who is actually far removed from Communism, what r/socialist discourse is actually like and who actually wants r/socialism to return to the past.  
     
Let us look at the activities of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements in the r/socialism threads owned by the ""whole people"".
     
&gt;""I believe Feminism has gone too far. I demand equal rights for all genders, especially Men!""
     
&gt;""We should ignore gender differences, what matters is class and class alone!""
     
&gt;""Communism can only come through peaceful means. Past Revolutions were failed and totalitarian, as you can read in the Black Book of Communism. Also, human rights were not respected""
     
&gt;""Socialism? You mean State Capitalism right? Only in Spain and in Ukraine has there been true socialism. Also, Stalin should have listened to Marx and build socialism with peasant communes instead of collectives""
     
&gt;""Hey dudes what's up? I just came here to ask why you want to take away my Freedom and Liberty. I will defend it to the death by the way and fuck you commies""
     
These examples show that the threads which have fallen into the clutches of such degenerates are part of a socialist subreddit only in name, that in fact they have become capitalist threads by which these persons propagate their ideas. The relationship of such persons to the socialists has turned into one between exploiters and exploited, between oppressors and oppressed.
     
The comments cited above are only a part of those published in the threads of r/socialism. They are enough to shock people, but there are many more which have not been published, many bigger and more serious cases which are covered up and shielded. We have quoted the above data in order to answer the question whether r/socialism has significantly deviated from Communism. This data is readily available and even the revisionist r/socialism clique are unable to deny it.
     
Under the rule of the r/socialist clique, there is no democracy for the Communists and Marxist-Leninists, there is democracy only for the handful of people expressing hegemonic and counter-revolutionary beliefs, for the privileged stratum and for the bourgeois elements, old and new. r/socialism's ""free speech for the whole people"" is nothing but out-and-out bourgeois democracy, i.e., a despotic dictatorship of the Opportunists, revisionists, sexists, racists and capitalists over the Communists.

http://www.psmag.com/magazines/pacific-standard-cover-story/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135/

It tells the story of a group of three academic colleagues, an anthropologist and two psychologists, whose work is challenging core assumptions on ""human nature"" within western academia.  What is interesting for us is on what grounds this challenge is being mounted.  But first, some background.

For anyone who has argued with vulgar liberals on political issues, I'm sure there have been at least a few instances where the charge against socialism degenerates into some variation of, ""but it goes against human nature!""  The argument usually goes that, by nature, *all* human beings are selfish and so seek the maximum benefit from whatever thing they are doing.  This idealized notion of the 'thing they are doing' usually means economic activity, and so for westerners this means the capitalist system is the greatest because it allows people to compete with each other under equal auspices of the law thus allowing for maximum personal development and individualism and so on until *Atlas Shrugged* itself has been vomited from the mouth of the liberal you've decided to converse with.

Marxism has taught that human behavior is not something innate to human beings (i.e. ""human nature"") but rather something wrought from human social interactions and interactions with the environment itself, the most fundamental forms of these interactions being economic production (environmental interactions) and trade (social interactions).  Such is the materialist conception of history.  As Engels wrote in the first paragraph of chapter III in *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*:

&gt;The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought, not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch.

The argument for a ""human nature"" polemic against socialism is the exact thing that Engels said we shouldn't be doing, ""the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice...""  At best, such an argument comes from a vulgar, pseudo-materialist perspective that looks solely to the basis of social interaction in which the person making the argument comes from, that being the west, which has a social structure that is very well built on selfishness and exploitation.  It is of no surprise then that in the academic west social scientists have sought to prove through their research efforts that everyone the world over acts as westerners do, because, like, you know, we're the best and stuff.

It is in this context that makes the above linked article so interesting.  Why?  Because the evidence the studies have gathered point to exactly what Marx and Engels had been saying as being correct.  Let us take interest in some quotes:

&gt;He [the anthropologist] knew that a vast amount of scholarly literature in the social sciences—particularly in economics and psychology—relied on the ultimatum game and similar experiments. At the heart of most of that research was the implicit assumption that the results revealed evolved psychological traits common to all humans, never mind that the test subjects were nearly always from the industrialized West.  
...  
Economists and psychologists, for their part, did an end run around the issue with the convenient assumption that their job was to study the human mind stripped of culture. The human brain is genetically comparable around the globe, it was agreed, so human hardwiring for much behavior, perception, and cognition should be similarly universal. No need, in that case, to look beyond the convenient population of undergraduates for test subjects. A 2008 survey of the top six psychology journals dramatically shows how common that assumption was: more than 96 percent of the subjects tested in psychological studies from 2003 to 2007 were Westerners—with nearly 70 percent from the United States alone. Put another way: 96 percent of human subjects in these studies came from countries that represent only 12 percent of the world’s population.  
...  
As Heine, Norenzayan, and Henrich furthered their search, they began to find research suggesting wide cultural differences almost everywhere they looked: in spatial reasoning, the way we infer the motivations of others, categorization, moral reasoning, the boundaries between the self and others, and other arenas. These differences, they believed, were not genetic. The distinct ways Americans and Machiguengans played the ultimatum game, for instance, wasn’t because they had differently evolved brains. Rather, Americans, without fully realizing it, were manifesting a psychological tendency shared with people in other industrialized countries that had been refined and handed down through thousands of generations in ever more complex market economies. When people are constantly doing business with strangers, it helps when they have the desire to go out of their way (with a lawsuit, a call to the Better Business Bureau, or a bad Yelp review) when they feel cheated. Because Machiguengan culture had a different history, their gut feeling about what was fair was distinctly their own. In the small-scale societies with a strong culture of gift-giving, yet another conception of fairness prevailed. There, generous financial offers were turned down because people’s minds had been shaped by a cultural norm that taught them that the acceptance of generous gifts brought burdensome obligations. **Our economies hadn’t been shaped by our sense of fairness; it was the other way around.**

(emphasis mine)

If Marx were alive he would have just shat his pants and in a bearded rage shouted,""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN SAYING ALL THIS TIME!?""

Furthermore, from their research these social scientists have produced a paper that indicates the behavior of westerners is actually far from the norm when it comes to the global population as a whole, and that Amerikkkans are on the extreme end of this particular spectrum of behavior (which they have aptly dubbed *western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic* or, WEIRD).  

Neither the paper nor the article says anything about the means and methods by which people have become WEIRD, but you can't expect these things from non-Marxist academics.  It is just nice to see bourgeois academia fly in the face of the (bigoted) assumptions of bourgeois academia, especially when it validates things that Marxists have been saying for over a century now.  

The bottom line is that culture is shaped by the world we live in (a social construct) based fundamentally on the given mode of economic production.  The next time some liberal tries to talk to you about ""human nature"" tell them to stop being a fucking WEIRDo and to see human society as it exists in its complex wholeness. ☭☭☭"	t5_2qolz	True

In line with proletarian youth revolt in France 2005 and the England in 2011, the suburbs of Stockholm have erupted in rioting after the police murdered an elderly man and apparently provoked youth by calling them ""monkeys"" and other derogatory terms.

What started off as a reportedly 50-100 youth from Husby burning cars, breaking windows and throwing rocks at police, has turned into three days of rioting which has spread significantly through the suburbs involving hundreds if not thousands of poor immigrant youth.

Last sunday, Yoani Sanchez - cuban blogger and ""political dissident"" against the ""castroist dictatorship"" arrived in Brazil. Her arrival was met with [protests](http://ujs.org.br/portal/?p=12713) from socialist youth and other radical groups. Monday she went to a public university in Bahia where a reactionary documentary about Cuba by a brazilian film-maker would be displayed. There, in a conference with the press, another protest happened and she refused to sign a [letter against the embargo](http://youtu.be/AktqSgcDUrk).  

There's also proof, most of it coming from wikileaks, that she's [sponsored by US operatives in cuba](http://ujs.org.br/portal/?p=12753) and the Millenium Institute - a brazilian free market think-tank financed by a big conservative media conglomerate, and there's also proof of other frauds on her supposed popularity in twitter. Here's [one of the cables](http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=07HAVANA622&amp;q=parmly%20sanchez%20yoani) showing her contact with the CIA. Here's [another text](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2009/lamrani111209.html) in english about the lies surrounding her blog.     

Of course the big corporate media oligopoly declared war on us. All TV news and newspapers are portraiting Sanchez as some sort of saint and martyr for freedom of speech and declaring open ideological war agaist the left. Their subterfuge is pretending that left-wing protesters are naive, that there's no left or right but ""democratic and anti-democratic"". Yesterday one of the biggest brazilian newspapers - the monarchist O Estado de São Paulo - published a piece on her two first conferences and wrote stuff like ""these college factions support the Landless Worker's Movement (which mainstream media considers a criminal organization) NK and Qaddafi"" (in an attempt at assassinating the character of Sanchez adversaries via association with ""scare words"") and ""they plot to command the workers to overthrow the bourgeoisie and install an unconstitutional dicatorship"", they also mentioned that ""all the protesters seemed to be less than 25 years old"". The headlines of the same newspaper were sucking up to the personal history of brazilian royal family that ruled during the 19th century, and interviewing one of their living descendants and claimants to the throne (yes this exists and yes, it is absurd), who wrote books advocating the restoration of monarchy and supporting the traditional agricultural land owning class, and other stuff such as calling environmentalists mentally ill and writing global warming denialist books. Another horrible magazine, Veja, which is extremely reactionary but is sadly the most widely circulated magazine in the country, published an article saying that Sanchez was being persecuted by a ""PT(worker's party)/Havana network"".    

It's a really disgusting to go through so many lies. Sanchez is a shameless liar, reproducing typical cold-war propaganda.  

If there's other brazilian comrades in here, I'd like to encourage them to protest Yoani Sanchez if she's passing by their cities or nearby and not let the lies of capitalist scum obfuscate the truth.  "	t5_2qolz	True

I'll begin with my favorite:

**Why, despite all the shortages, was the toilet paper in East Germany always 2-ply?**

Because they had to send a copy of everything they did to Moscow.
	

Also, here are some Radio Yerevan jokes (popular in the Soviet Union, they were in the form of people calling in to Armenian radio, asking various questions, and receiving ""newspeak"" type responses).

**Q: Is there a difference between capitalism and communism?**

A: In principle, yes. In capitalism, man exploits man. In communism, it's the reverse.

**Q: Is it true that there is freedom of speech in the Soviet Union the same as there is the USA?**

A: In principle, yes. In the USA, you can stand in front of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC, and yell, ""Down with Reagan!"", and you will not be punished. In the Soviet Union, you can stand in the Red Square in Moscow and yell, ""Down with Reagan!"", and you will not be punished.

**Q: Is it true that the Czechs called on the Red Army to help them?**

A: Basically, yes. But it took the Red Army until 1968 to follow up the Czech request from 1939

R/communism is not america.  

This should be obvious of course. But I say this because some communists, while discussing their pragmatic support within the context of american policy, forget that a lot of us (myself included) do not hail from your land. Do not ask that we be understanding about this or that reason for which Obama is better than Romney or whatever. Some of us outside of america have been directly harmed by his policies. Some of us outside of america have been historically fucked over by the President of the United States, whoever he was at the time.  

You just cannot, YOU MUST NOT, expect other communists to sympathize with your choice when Obama or whomever is going to be ordering hir and hir family's death tomorrow, or that he already did. Communists are fighting against the President of the United States all over the world now. They have already lost many loved ones to him. DO NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOUR CHOICE MAKES SENSE TO US.

For those looking for the essential bio on Lenin, [Tony Cliff's biography](http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/lenin1/index.htm) is the standard. Also, actually reading Lenin cannot be substituted by meta-analysis. (marxists.org, ftw)

Out of these Chris Read's work comes highly recommended.

As someone on Kasama explained to me, you don't really have many options because mainstream media don't cover protest activities. I don't watch TV (either Western or Russian), but there are some things that I am aware of and you are probably not.

Russia Today was created as Kremlin propaganda tool in 2005 when our government decided to 'improve' so-called Russia's image in Western countries. It's pretty much common knowledge. Why when RT covers recent anti-capitalist protests? In my opinion, because Kremlin is trying to troll its partners who blame Putin for surpressing human rights. Usually they (Putin and the West) are getting along just fine though.

I understand when comrades post links to RT videos, maybe there are some useful info there, I don't know, but I can't stand to see those fat journos who get money from Kremlin who brutally suppresses opposition and at the same time they talk about human rights and other shit and support Occupy.

**To the the male audience, particularly new members:** Here are some important points you should take into consideration. Pay attention.

(1) Not everyone is a ""bro"", ""he"", ""him"", ""guy"", ""dude"", etc. Please don't assume gender unless you are certain. Instead, use [gender-neutral pronouns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun). When addressing a general crowd, we are **comrades** and not ""guys"".

(2) ""Mens rights"" are counter-revolutionary. Men are not oppressed in any regards due to their gender. You cannot be a ""mens rights activist"" and a communist simultaneously.

(3) Pornography is exploitation and oppression against women, queer people and children. Don't be a creep.

(4) Prostitution is not liberating but cruel exploitation of women and a social ill which needs to be terminated.

No communist movement can be successful without the participation of women. In the on-going people's wars, women form bulk of the most heroic and dedicated fighters while men are more likely to be cowards and desert in face of repression. 

In Bangladesh during the liberation war, Maoists bombed the headquarters of pornographers. 

In Nepal, women squad leaders encouraged women to publicly beat and humiliate rapists, abusive and drunk husbands, adulterers, and so forth.

In Peru, the ruling class was so terrified of the power of women that stories were spread about the cruelty and abusiveness of women guerrillas who, supposedly, slit the throats of men who cried or were cowards. See ""[Shining Path Women: So Many and So Ferocious""](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/world/lima-journal-shining-path-women-so-many-and-so-ferocious.html) from NY Times.

Long live proletarian feminism!


**Note: To clarify further on points #3 and #4, I draw mainly from and am most influenced by Andrea Dworkin who had a very subtle but nevertheless clear influence on Maoists in the west. Please refer to some of her works such as [*I Want a Twenty-Four-Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape*](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIE.html) and [*Pornography Happens to Women*](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/PornHappens.html).

Personally, I find the third article by Mehrotra and Clawson the most compelling. It illustrates with lots of data that throughout the 1960's and 70's, the USSR engaged in a great deal of trade with the third world, especially India, and that the Soviet Union profited both from trade with and aid to India. An effect of Soviet trade and aid policies was also that production in India became focused around what would be beneficial for the USSR. Moreover, the USSR *exported capital* to India, which is the fundamental criterion for judging whether the USSR was imperialist in the Leninist sense.

As I said though, the first two articles argue against the social-imperialist analysis, and although I think the case for the USSR being social-imperialist is made pretty convincingly in the second two articles, you have enough info in this publication to make up your own mind, I think."	t5_2qolz	True

We emphatically state that /r/communism did not participate in the drafting of ""An Open Letter"". Neither the mods nor the community weighed in on the opinions contained in this text.

Our official stance on ""An Open Letter"" is that it merely validates the fundamentally anti-communist opinions that MaoistRebelNews has expressed in the past.

MaoistRebelNews for his part merely repeated his long-running anti-communist stance.

We release this statement in order to clarify /r/communism's position which has been mischaracterized by the parties involved, as reflected in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1fp91y/maoist_rebel_news_responds_to_critics_reply_to_an/).

It is /r/communism's long running position to stand in solidarity with queer struggles and to denounce homophobia wherever it exists.

By way of introduction, I'm the chairperson of the uOttawa Marxist Students' Association. This June, we'll be hosting the Second National Conference of Revolutionary Youth and Students in Ottawa, where students from a multitude of different locales (Quebec City, Rimouski, Toronto, Guelph, and New York just to name a few) and revolutionary organisations will come together. What we're trying to do is build a student and youth movement that is actually combative and capable of fighting back against the Canadian ruling class' reactionary offensive, in a way that the current social-democratic student organisations haven't been able to.

So here's where r/communism comes in:

We're hoping to have participants from an even wider variety of cities, towns, campuses etc. than we did last time. If you're a student and you're reading this, and you think the development of a revolutionary student movement is important, **please get in contact with me**. Or, if you aren't a student but know revolutionary students and youth who you think would be interested in this, **please have them get in contact with me**. I'll hopefully be travelling throughout Ontario in mid-April to try and promote the conference, so the more people I can speak to along the way the better.

Here's more information for people that want it:

I'm currently a 17 year old kid about to go 18 (so maybe it's my youth that makes me a little too idealistic). I used to be a right-libertarian for some time. My favourite class was AP macroeconomics and after the class economics became a bit of a hobby of mine, but politics never interested me. In my view politics only got in the way of economic progress (as French Utopian socialist Henri de Saint-Simon says, political science should mean the science of production). It was only until I read P.-J. Proudhon's *What is Property?* that I realised what capitalism actually was. After that I regarded myself as a libertarian socialist, a bit of an anarchist. Soon I became interested in Marx' *Capital* wanting to understand the deeper analysis of capitalism. Thus far I'm doing a pretty good job of understanding it all, it's just that I get really sad while I'm reading it. I just graduated a couple days ago and it really sucks knowing that that's the true nature of the world, that I'm going to have to struggle to look for work in a declining job market. It's such a depressing read. I was just wondering if anyone had the same experience as mine?

**tl;dr**
Marx' *Capital* is a depressing read and further shows me the injustices of the world; anyone have the same experience?

I also would like to recommend this text by a radical trans feminist which express some good points and I generally agree with everything she said (as I myself subscribe to a non-exclusionary radical feminism): http://radtransfem.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/sex-educations-gendering-and-regendering-women/    

There were a recent debate in a local blog between such sects, unfortunately handled by a mostly liberal pro free speech feminist and she could not deal with this debate very well, to the point of even calling the radfems ""misandric"" for despising men and masculinity. The trans-exclusionary radfems also made unfortunate comments about transexuality being a disorder. Besides this being utterly wrong, this also contradicts the main stance of radical feminism which I'll explain below. On the other side, some trans people where saying that they aren't oppressed by patriarchy but by cis women specifically, also they claim cis women aren't ""that oppressed"" which is also unfortunate and untrue.    

To make it easier for us to handle such debate when it appears, I'll list the main points of both radical feminism and trans activists, their flaws and try to come up with a materialist approach on the subject.     

**These are okay:**    


Radical feminism   
* gender is a social construct, not a biological fact.   
* there are specific issues of being socialized as a girl/woman that need to be addressed.  
* Patriarchy oppresses female bodied individuals and promotes hate against female bodies.  
* in the current society, the definition of womanhood is oppressive.    
* denouncing LGBT movements that exclude lesbians and bisexual women.   
* rejecting so called ""sex positive"" trends in feminist movements and adopting anti-pornography line.    


Trans activists    
* trans women are actual women and they belong in the women liberation movements.    
* acknowledgment and visibility of trans(*) identities.    
* one can have physical incongruence with their genitals and other characteristics used by patriarchy to assign sex to individuals, feel they are ""wrong"", sex dysphoria etc.    
* there are specific issues of not identifying with your gender assigned at birth and these need to be addressed.
* denouncing LGBT movements that exclude transgenders.

I think all those points are correct and they aren't mutually exclusive in any way.    

**These aren't okay:**   
 

Radical feminism    
* identity politics. (in this case, they are guilty of treating feminism as a closed club with no practice in reality)    
* ""transwomen are men trying to hijack feminism"".      
* gender essentialism: one need to to have XX sexual chromosomes and to be female bodied in order to be considered a woman. (those who support this are not only completely wrong, but they are also being contradictory, since the main base for radical feminism is that gender is a social construct)    
* ""apolitical"" alignment, saying marxist-feminists want to hijack feminism.      
            

Trans activists    
* identity politics.      
* ""born this way"", biological arguments.      
* oppression olympics (saying that ciswomen are SO MUCH more privileged is really absurd, also claiming a person from any oppressed group has privilege over another is not okay. As a white person I'll not claim facing racism, but as a woman I have to deal with misoginy in a nearly daily basis, but it's not a competition of who has it worse, women or people of colour.)     
* misogyny disguised as identity statements. (example: I remember a person in SRSgaming saying their queer friends would make ""vaginophobic"" jokes in their world of warcraft party, this is really awful in face of the majority of women have serious body image issues and disturbing realities such as genital mutilation.)     


Both sides lack of a proper structural approach.    
Here are some quotes from the article that I thought useful and pretty much express my opinion on this subject:   

&gt; Radical feminism understands gender as an ideology of male supremacy, serving as one of many tools which uphold patriarchy and other dominant orders, and radical feminists consider any attempt to explain gendered behaviours as “innate” to be antifeminist.     

I wholeheartedly agree with this. It's necessary to abolish gender, this does not mean we are erasing people who want to identify as any gender, it's not a matter of discourse and how you personally interact with given discourse, but how the patriarchal ideology is real and present on our lives. Patriarchy is a systematically oppressive reality that puts women in a submissive role.     

&gt; Cisgendered violence isn’t necessarily ‘more’ or ‘less’ violent than gendered violence – I would like to reject these terms as absolute properties of violence, since the hurt is in the experience of violence, which varies with the survivor – but it is violence with a different purpose and it will be applied in different ways. None of this is an appeal to “oppression olympics”, in which transsexual and cissexual women can compete to decide who had the most unhappy childhoods. Cissexism and sexism are not comparable, are both tragedies, and cannot be traded off against one another.     
 
This is very important. It's not wise to reject the experience of cis-women as women and victims of the patriarchy, you also can't really say trans-women at some point had male privilege. I'd add that the concept of privilege while useful to deal with the typical sheltered neckbearded basement dwelling redditor, it's still a liberal concept at the core and very complicated to be applied in real life.    

&gt; Who owns the term ‘woman’? I’m not interested in defining it biologically. As a feminist, I view ‘woman’ as a political category, tautologically defined as ‘a target of the oppression aimed at women’.    

This also applies to race. The ""black race"" is a political category, it does not exist as a biological fact and no person in good conscience would use these same arguments that are being used to define gender biologically (example: male brain/female brain bullshit) to explain race. Only racists would say there's a ""black brain"" and ""white brain"", so what does this tell about people who use this same argument to explain gender?     
Despite that, racism is a real oppressive ideology that people of colour experience in their daily lives.    

&gt; In writing this essay, I’ve looked to dispel simplified views of transsexual women’s experience held by trans* and queer-theory thinkers and by radical feminists. Transsexual women are not identical to cissexual women, because our histories and gender educations (and reeducations) are different. But neither are we completely distinct from cissexual women, in that many of our oppressions are identical or similar and we are both exposed to, and absorb, sex role education about what we – women – should be and do.      
&gt; Gender ideology is sufficiently potent that it is able to bring both cissexual women and transsexual women to some extent under the influence of the female sex role. This is done using a variety of tactics, with different tactics applied to cissexual and transsexual women, but the goal – however successful it may be – is to gender all women as women, i.e. to place us in a position of submission to patriarchy so that male power can be upheld.     

In short, all women should work together aiming to destroy patriarchy and thus, gender as it is in the current society.     

As I said, I place myself as non-exclusionary radical marxist feminist and I believe my stance is congruent with a proper materialist analysis of the subject.     

First of all, as a materialist one should reject identity politics and non-structural post modern theory. Further, one should also reject biological explanations that use any kind of human nature arguments. There isn't a state of nature for society nor the individual. At this point I should observe that while one is not born with gender, sexuality, race, etc, one has those cast upon them from early age, still children can interact in different manners with the social stimuli from this early age and are able to perceive and describe themselves according these stimuli.     

As a communist, the means of action aren't also the same of identity groups or liberal activists. While we aim for liberation of oppressed groups, this liberation does not happen through the bourgeois legal means in the form of specific politics aimed to attend a certain group of people. We aim to overthrown the current system, it's moral values and its mechanisms of reproduction. We aim for all oppressed people to be fully integrated in the proletarian society through the elimination of oppressive superstructure (practices, behavior and speech).    "	t5_2qolz	True

&gt;Communists do not fight for personal military power (they must in no circumstances do that, and let no one ever again follow the example of Chang Kuo-tao), but they must fight for military power for the Party, for military power for the people. As a national war of resistance is going on, we must also fight for military power for the nation. Where there is naivety on the question of military power, nothing whatsoever can be achieved. It is very difficult for the labouring people, who have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary ruling classes for thousands of years, to awaken to the importance of having guns in their own hands. Now that Japanese imperialist oppression and the nation-wide resistance to it have pushed our labouring people into the arena of war, Communists should prove themselves the most politically conscious leaders in this war. Every Communist must grasp the truth, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."" Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. Yet, having guns, we can create Party organizations, as witness the powerful Party organizations which the Eighth Route Army has created in northern China. We can also create cadres, create schools, create culture, create mass movements. Everything in Yenan has been created by having guns. All things grow out of the barrel of a gun. According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power. Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the ""omnipotence of war"". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed. We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun.

How relevant do you think this reasoning is to the United States today? There is no revolutionary class hegemony, so how could the private ownership of guns be productive? So much of the liberal-conservative back and forth I've seen in light of today's shooting in Connecticut seems intent on finding the perfect degree of gun presence in any given society, but isn't the need and proper role of fire arms conditional on the material state a particular society is in at the moment?

Months ago, the CivCraft server was formed with the goal of experimenting in societal organization, in Minecraft. On the first day, the Libertarian Socialist International Federation was founded. It's goal, to create the perfect society in Minecraft.

In the unfolding months, empires have risen and fallen, cities have been built and burned. The LSIF has seen war, peace, chaos, and most of all progress. And we are looking forward still. We want you to join, fill the ranks of leftists who have already come to love CivCraft.

**What is CivCraft?**

The CivCraft server was made with the intention of experiment. As a result, plugins and mods have been added to encourage city building and stimulate trade and co-dependance. You can read about the plugins here. Among them are; Bookworm, allowing for written books, copying, and making use of bookshelves. MineralVein, which localizes the distribution of ores into hundred-block veins. And Citadel, a plugin which adds block-by-block reinforcement to guard against greifers and thieves.

**Who plays CivCraft?**

Many factions play on CivCraft, hundreds of people in total. Some large number are Anarcho-Capitalists. There is a failing ""Feudalistic"" faction. There are Statist Leftists, who mirror the USSR. Most of the successful cities are home to some mix of Statists and Anarchists, Leftists and Capitalists. And of course, there is the LSIF: A broad coalition of the radical left, ranging from Marxist-Leninists to Anarcho-syndicalists. We even have some Mutualists.

**If you're interested in joining...**

CivCraft's Server IP is ""untamedears.com"". Contact myself or another LSIF member for where to get started once you're ingame. We'll also be adding a subreddit, called /r/LibSocMC_Talk, to manage new applicants. Just state your ideology, In-game name, and any other relevant experience you'd like us to consider in a post there, and it'll be handled. We rarely turn down serious applicants.

Comrades I would like to tell you why I'm very critical of the function of charity. Especially consumerist driven charity. Where you for example buy fairtrade products which cost more, but they pay poor farmers in Latin America a little bit more. So the very act of egotist consumption, includes in its price the opposite. 

Well what is wrong with this model? Am I against helping poor people? No I am against the underlying idea behind charity. Of course it is better than nothing that starving children, poor peasants and so on get at least the little help people are willing to give. But just think about the hidden message and brainwashing there is in these acts of unselfishness. 

Today I bought some products and gave a little to charity, now I can feel good about myself and my life in the capitalist society I reside in, basically it is emotional porn, that acts to not prevent or change the system which allows these horibble conditions to exist, but to keep the global capitalist system that are the cause of these problems to not be the issue, so the consumer goes home and forgets about the poor starving children, why should he/she think about it? They already did their duty and they can go on and live their life in content in the capitalist order. 

""Aha"" says the capitalist, ""it is not the system that is the problem, we just need to give more to charity!"" So the thing that is the cause of the problem, is telling us, it is the solution to it. 

Be wary comrades of these kinds of sophisticated brainwashing, which acts to keep the masses content with the poverty and misery, things that exists because of capitalism. "	t5_2qolz	True

1352082931.0	12n975	A critique of liberal feminism.	atlol2	57	19	13	"There are several important demands for a society where equality is sought after in the objective relations of people, women's rights (and the rights of those other historically oppressed groups, such as people of color and LGBT) are near the top of the list, and its something I read and study about a lot.     

There is something that bothers me about the majority of blogs that I read about the subject (which I must confess, is a limited amount, as I read just a few american blogs and a few from my home country), which is the excessive liberal discourse. Such blogs make several important complaints and demands, but they hardly ever offer solutions, or will leave the solutions to the field of philosophical speculation or fighting in the bourgeois judicial system, under its own terms. This kind of feminism also tries to pretend to be apolitical, as if the conflict between left wing and right wing could never solve the question of women's oppression. Yes, there are several men in the left which are sexist, especially within the ""moderate left"", or the right wing that calls itself the left, such as the american democrats. Nevertheless, the third-wave of feminism, with its post-modern goals of being post-political and post-structural, ignores that historically the left has always been for women's rights (even in victorian times, an extremely problematic age, Marx and Engels took up the cause of women. So did Marx's daughters, who were keen to study their father's works, and were political militants against oppression and inequality, what can be considered by itself a feminist position) and that there was a much greater equality between genders in socialist countries before this agenda was even taken up in the west. In the 1950's, a particularly sexist decade for the United States, in the USSR there was full employment for both sexes (and all women worked), access to free higher education, free universal healthcare, creches where people could leave their children during work hours and women receiving military honors and titles for their heroism in the second world war. Feminists today should not look at what Eastern Europe has become after the disaster of capitalist restoration and project that into the past, because that was not the reality of socialism. That is an incorrect approach.    

Of course, criticism should and must be applied to those countries and their respective political and economic systems, but we cannot ignore the historical contribution of socialism for the improvement of women's rights, including in capitalist countries. I advance the view that many rights were granted in western countries not just because of civil rights movements, such as those that took place in America in the 1960's, but also because the great disparity between capitalism and socialism would become very evident otherwise. In the case of civil rights, we can just look at propaganda from socialist countries, which praised the joint efforts of all races in building a socialist nation, we look at their anti-racist laws, and we must remind ourselves that at the same time this propaganda was being produced and promoted by socialist countries there was institutional racism in the US and the South African Apartheid was being supported by the capitalist block. Today, after the disappearance of actually existing socialist nations, we see that the old opinions on race and gender from the beginning of the 20th century are making their return at full speed, ignoring well established studies in the fields of anthropology and other social sciences, and being supported by pseudoscientific ""evolutionary-psychology"" think tanks, which use faulty methodology and statistical research, combined with neuroscience and genetics, in order to reestablish ""scientific"" support for patriarchal, white supremacist chauvinism.    

Going back to my original criticism of post-modern liberal feminism, I am going to cite two more points that peeve me the most:    

1) The demand for more ""women CEOs"", or for equality in bourgeois terms.    

I see many blogs complaining that the majority of CEOs are men and that women should have more high hierarchy jobs.One of the authors that mentions this is Naomi Wolf in her book ""The Beauty Myth"". Demanding for more women CEOs ignores the negative aspect of the existance of CEOs. I do not want to be a CEO, a capitalist manager, and I do not want men to be CEOs or capitalist managers either, I want the capitalist class to be destroyed. Why would any women act differently from men if she became a capitalist? We do not believe in gender essentialism, that there are innate biological characteristics that grants any gender a propensity for goodness or extra dilligence. Historical materialism teaches us that society produces the consciousness of the individual. Margaret Thatcher is not going to be good for anyone. What difference should we make from Thatcher or Reagan? In the latest hollywood produced propaganda, the Iron Lady, the historical context of Thatcher and Britain is abstracted so that only her own personal history becomes relevant, and thus they can attempt to turn her into a feminist icon who faced and dealt with the sexism of the men around her (I don't deny that this happened). This is the distortion of liberalism and liberal feminism, that fails to mention that Thatcher was the oppressor of millions of british women who lost access to several guarantees to essential items for their livelihood, and who also oppressed argentine women through her imperialist military incursions, not counting the labor of other third world women which for centuries and to this day is used to prop up british capitalism. We should not wish for women to reach equal status as oppressors within the capitalist system.    

2) Extreme anti-violence posture.  

Some feminists (a very vocal example is Anita Sarkesheen of the Feminist Frequency blog, who was recently harassed by a bunch of chauvinist pigs, but that's another story) adhere to a kind of pacifism of excessive proportions that often borders on gender essentialism. We know that in our society emotion and peaceful solutions are often (mis) characterized as something feminine, while stoic and violent solutions are seen as masculine, and due to the fact that society is patriarchal, these masculine attitudes are more often than not seen as the positive ones. The conclusion of some people, mainly those who aim to be critics of popular culture, is that if a woman is stoic or uses violence to solve a conflict, she is adhering to masculine values, which while they are seen as positive in the greater context of our society, liberals (both in general, but in this case also as critics of popular culture) will always consider it negative, and turn this pacifism into a kind of moral judgement. We should see violence as one of the many revolutionary tools available at our disposal.     

We should question the assumption that women who solve conflicts violently are adhering to masculine traits or values. Does that mean that all the women who were soviet war heroes, those who fought bravely against imperialism in vietnam, revolutionaries all over the world who took up arms to fight their oppressors are anti-feminist, because they are inadequate examples due to their violence and thus undeserving of our admiration?     

It is evident to me that this kind of liberalism that claims to be apolitical fails to account for real life examples in which women have fought and won battles towards their liberation. In fact, many people will consider revolutions as something intrinsically masculine, due to the fact that it is a conflict solved by means of armed struggle. I find it disappointing to see feminists endorsing this kind of opinion and dismissing revolutionaries such as Jiang Qing or the Cuban Federation of Women as unfeminist.    

Liberal equality falls short, because they merely aim for the tolerance that institutions can offer, but never really critically addressing such institutions. Liberals are satisfied in promoting the so called ""equality of opportunities"" in which an individual can compete within the capitalist meritocracy and that's why they wouldn't be able to eliminate the inequalities of our society. Some sucessful self-made person anecdotes among women or people of color can not change the fact that their majority would still be poor and oppressed because of their disadvantaged place in society and this is endemic of the capitalist system."	t5_2qolz	True

1368271915.0	1e4h9y	Pop Stalinism in Russia today and why it sucks	cave_rat	51	19	13	"The modern Russian state is anti-communist and rabidly anti-Stalinist. For example, on Victory Day (9 May in Russia) the state officially 'congratulated' WWII soldiers who endured much and 'suffered in Stalinist concentration camps' (!). President Vladimir Putin uses every occasion to publicly denounce communism and Soviet past, especially Stalin era.

On the other hand, Putin and his clique are also trying to capitalize on Soviet achievements, and especially on victory over fascism, but they are saying, of course, that it was 'Russia' who defeated the Nazis, though modern Russia and those betrayers who came to power in 1991 have nothing to do with victory of Soviet people. Kremlin doesn't support the so-called revival of Stalinism, for example, Stalin buses, monuments etc. but neither it hinders it.

Why is that? Obviously, Putin cannot rely on liberal ideology alone to support his power, because it is highly unpopular inside the country. His anti-Stalinist rhetoric is aimed mostly on the West and on liberal Russian bourgeoisie. For the rest of population, he uses a mix of rabid nationalism, religion and old Soviet ideology, which sometimes takes rather disgusting forms, as with pop stalinism.

What exactly is pop stalinism? This is a 'rehabilitaion' of Stalin, who is now portrayed not as a great proletarian revolutionary, not as a Soviet leader and a communist, but as an 'effective manager' (literally!), 'great state leader' and a 'moderniser' (who modernised the economy). Comparison with Putin is obvious: 'Putin is Stalin today!'

Pop stalinism is extremely reactionary. The radical Russian Left (except for Trotskyites of course, who use this phenomenon as an another argument against Stalin and Stalinism) doesn't support it."	t5_2qolz	True

1366232483.0	1ck514	Why is the US population (perceived as) particularly reactionary?	bolCHEvik	49	11	22	"I think it is a common diagnosis that the US is particularly more impervious to leftist ideas than other countries today. Generally we have this explained by weekly reposts of that John Steinbeck quote in /r/socialism. I would like to discuss this.  

First of all, how unique is this phenomenon to the US? And is it a contemporary phenomenon or more or less a historical constant since the 20th century? Was this a unique phenomenon even in Steinbeck's time?  

We know that liberalism is the dominant ideology in most of the world today, so we would expect that most people believe in the promised class mobility achieved through merit that capitalism promises but doesn't deliver. So this belief alone wouldn't make the US particularly more anti-communist.  

There is of course, the historical record of the cold-war, with, for better or worse, the US representing the international bourgeoisie and the USSR representing the international proletariat. Undoubtedly curtailing the expansion of the USSR was in the interests of the international bourgeoisie in a way that curtailing fascism never was (the international bourgeoisie was great with Pinochet, Franco, Salazar, Saddam, the Apartheid, and everything else, according to their convenience), but had united in an unprecedent way in the age of imperialism to contain the eastern bloc. Truly though, the biggest conflicts of the cold war were perhaps not the open military engagements that took place, but the ideological war within the great powers themselves, the attempt to guide class struggle towards or away from revolution everywhere.   

So in the context of the cold-war, there was a propaganda effort that was more longer lasting and more effective in the US that ultimately led it to reject socialism more than other countries. This means propaganda in education, from children's education to academia, in every news channel, in cultural production, in grassroots political organizing, and so on, in a manner that wasn't so thorough in other countries. That is one possibility. We would have to ask ourselves why this was particularly stronger in the US. Was it due to its status as the leader in the fight against the eastern bloc, and as such, it led and developed strategies and pioneered their implementation first?     

There is also the theory of labor-aristocracy. The US, as the dominant imperialist center, bribes its working class with superprofits from capital exports to the periphery. But this is not a unique phenomenon to the US in the first world, other imperialist nations are very nearly the same in this regard, arguably with small differences (slightly higher or lower wages, the presence welfare states, different consumption habits).  

Perhaps the way that US society is organized, I don't know, suburbs being an urbanisation method that, in general, generate more individualism than densely populated areas. Perhaps it is the US's ""unique"" historical background that prevents it from considering leftist ideas in the same way, with the liberal founding fathers and their cult of personality being more emphasized? Perhaps it is nationalism?  

I suppose I am just looking at all these variables and trying to look at the hypothesis that the US is special in it's anti-leftism. There are several of these that seem to have some validity to them, although it isn't clear to me why these variables themselves are unique to the US. I just figured this was a worthwhile discussion.

ERT is not only a TV station, it's a lot of cultural organisations that employed thousands of people. There has been cultural controversy too, since ERT is a cultural benchmark for Greece.

They who truly live cannot help but to be citizens and partisans. Indifference is apathy, parasitism, perversion, not life. That's why I hate the indifferent.

Indifference is the burden of history. Indifference operates with great power on history. It operates passively, but it operates. It is fate; that which cannot be counted on; it is that which twists programs and ruins the best-conceived plans; it is the brute matter that chokes intelligence. That which happens, the evil that weighs upon all, happens because most of humanity renounces its own will, allows laws to be passed that only revolt can nullify, and leaves men that only mutiny can overthrow to achieve power. Thanks to indifference, few hands weave the fabric of collective life unsurveilled, and the masses ignore it because they are careless; then it seems like it is fate that runs over everything and everyone, it looks as if history is but an enormous natural phenomenon, an eruption, an earthquake of which everyone is a victim, those who consent as well as those who dissent, those who knew as well as those who didn't, the active as well as the indifferent. Some whimper pitifully, others curse obscenely, but none, or very few, ask themselves: if I too had fulfilled my duty, if I had tried to impose my will, would this have happened?

This too is why I hate the indifferent: Their wailing as if eternally innocent is a nuisance to me. I hold every person liable to how they fulfilled the task life has given them and continues to give them every day, of what they have done, and especially what they have not done. And I feel I have the right to be unrelenting, not to squander my compassion, of not having to share my tears with them.

I am a partisan, I am alive, and in the conscience of those on my part I feel the pulse of the future city we are building. And in it, the social chain does not rest on a few, nothing that happens in it is a matter of luck, nor the product of fate, but the intelligent work of citizens. In it, nobody is looking out their window while the few sacrifice and drain themselves. I live, I am a partisan. That is why I hate those who don’t take sides, I hate the indifferent.

1361029819.0	18n2k5	What do folks here think of veganism and the animal rights movement?	RageoftheMonkey	49	13	66	"In the anarchist circles I've been involved with animal rights is a huge issue, and many people hold up veganism (and to a lesser degree vegetarianism) as some sort of grand moral choice. 

Though I haven't spent as much time with Marxist groups, I definitely haven't seen the same sort of emphasis. Since I haven't seen much mention about it here, I'm interested in starting a discussion in this subreddit about the issue. 

I personally view any sort of animal rights struggle as coming far behind human class struggle in importance. It only really seems to exist in the most privileged sectors of the first world and in my mind detracts from a focus on combating capitalism. That said, I think that in a post-capitalist society we should use as few animals as possible in order to minimize suffering (and use resources as efficiently as possible). This would probably include a shift towards vegetarianism and veganism in the countries that could do so more easily. 

I think at this point the decision to eat meat or not is a personal choice often dictated by class, and we should not think of it as meaning much more than that.

Thoughts?

Some consider Romney and the Republicans to represent unrestrained laissez-faire capitalism, while Obama and the Democrats represent 'Keynesian' liberal capitalism, so we should vote Democrat and at least get some sort of social safety net. I want to point out that this interpretation is erroneous for anyone who does not yet understand.

Obama is right-wing. He has extended the Bush tax cuts under his administration. He has filled his cabinet with conservative advisers, many of them from the Trilateral Commission. He appointed an ex-Monsanto executive as Senior Advisor to FDA. The rich-poor gap has continued to increase under his watch. Although he appeared to champion the idea of universal healthcare, his first choice for Secretary of Health was someone who lobbied against it for years. Obama also announced that he has cut $1 Trillion from domestic spending, and vowed to cut $4 Trillion more in his next term. Him and Romney both agree on this. It may also interest some comrades to know that 600,000 public sector jobs have vanished under Obama. Even under Bush, 800,000 public sector jobs were created.

As for ""allies of the working class,"" trade union rights have eroded under the Obama administration. One need look no further than their decision to host the DNC in Charlotte, North Carolina, a city and state notorious for its anti-labor actions in an attempt to make it a more lucrative spot for business. Obama is also a close friend of Ralph Emanuel, the mayor who opposed the Chicago teachers' strike. Even Romney sided with Emanuel on the issue of the teachers' strike. Some big difference between the parties, alright. Not only that, but Obama's ""Race to the Top"" legislation is more of the same ""educational reform"" bullshit that demands merit pay and teacher evaluation based on testing.

Now to civil rights, the true disaster. I'm sure we all know about NDAA, the act that essentially declared martial law by giving the government the authority to arrest citizens without trial. It's also interesting to note that Obama wrote a letter encouraging the Supreme Court to approve of cavity searches. The Democrats have also approved of drone strikes and extrajudicial executions anywhere in the world. Do I even need to mention the $3.7 Trillion sunk into Obama's conquest of the Middle East? $68,000 per missile, if I'm not mistaken.

As for Obama's supposed success at revitalizing the failing capitalist economy, America needs to create 9 million jobs in order to cover up for jobs lost during the Great Recession. Obama has produced 100,000. That is 1 percent of what is needed. Not that the bourgeoisie are suffering or anything, because corporate profits have reached record-breaking highs under the watchful eyes of the Democrats while wages and jobs continue to plummet.

None of this information is secret. Comrades who have been following the US election closely will know most of this. I only hope that I've given those undecided comrades something to consider.

So I'm reading a Trotsky biography written by Robert Service, other than being really impressed by the man, I thought this letter written to Natalia Sedova is worth sharing. Not only is it really dirty, it reminds us all that other than a historic revolutionary, he was also a man. It was allegedly written in 1937, after Natalia found out he was having an affair with Frida. It also contrasts with Trotsky's usual seriousness. It almost makes me wonder if it was truly him who's written it. The biography I'm reading is in French, so let me attempt to translate the letter in English:

&gt; *Since my arrival here, my poor dick hasn't even once gotten hard. It seems that it doesn't even exist. It too is resting, after the tension of the past few days. But there isn't only that - I also, with all my heart - I think with tenderness about the softness of your dear old pussy. I want to fuck it, and push my tongue in its depths. Nataliochka, my dear, I will fuck you with all my strength, with my tongue and my cock.*

They had some fine radio equipment. They were going to set up a base here in Albania. At that time my brother was in the Central Committee and said he thought we ought to be ableto have some fun out of the CIA too. Everyone agreed. After all, we’d gotten their radios and their codes and all the rest of it. So we informed the CIA in Rome that the revolt was going fine. All we needed was more weapons. And the CIA flew in bazookas and gelignite and all kinds of weapons. And themore they sent, the more successes we reported back. We let the CIA fly in one consignment of weapons after another, and as soon as they came flying in, we snapped them up.
They were good weapons. And cheap, too. But in the end even the CIA noticed something was amiss. They’d flown in masses of weapons and still nothing was happening in Albania.Then we told them how we’d been putting them on.Transmitted it in their own code. And then we tapped out Ha-ha-ha.”

1370377866.0	1fob2i	The Social Function of Job Interviews (a Marxist-Feminist critique in plain language)	boleroinferno	39	10	4	"I tried today to give a female friend advice about interviewing for a job. My advice went along the lines of 'act confident', 'be assertive', 'shake hands'. I was somewhat knocked over when she replied that the opposite behavior is most likely to land her a job. Now my friend has a great deal of experience at landing jobs, so I believed her when she said that male interviewers prefer her to act shy and non-assertive during the interview. I had never considered what it must be like for a woman in a job interview, and moreover in retrospect it seems that all the advice I'd ever heard was directed at an audience which was assumed to be male.
Naturally I wondered: what are the expectations of women in job interviews? Moreover, why are they different from men and what does this tell us about the social function of job interviews? The Forbes article entitled “Dress For Interview Success” states that,

""According to a study by Frank Bernieri, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at Oregon State University, within the first 10 seconds of meeting your interviewer--otherwise known as the meet-and-greet--that person has decided whether or not you're right for the job.""

So if a job interview lasts 10 minutes when the hiring decision was made in 10 seconds, is 98% of the interview simply wasted time? Moreover, even though the decision may be made in 10 seconds, is it necessarily an accurate decision and to what standard? The author of the article seems to think it's meaningful as she further asserts that,

""Those who come across as polished and pulled together are quite simply more likely to be hired than those who are seen as putting in less effort.""

Let's think about this for a moment. How many of us have 'failed' a job interview in favor of someone comparably well-dressed and prepared? What does “pulled together” even refer to? The key phrase 'who are seen as' of course descends the whole prescription into subjectivity. This is quite important to note since a person with money certainly can make arbitrary judgments about who to hire (anti-discrimination laws are never sufficient to eliminate discrimination). In order, however, to have a meaningful discussion we will assume that multiple employers are generally making consistent decisions about who to hire.

The second half of the article is an extended discussion of what to wear to an interview with such suggestions that women 'dress conservatively' with 'absolutely no cleavage' while decrying 'casual ensembles' as sloppy-looking. The crisis of women who don't know what to wear is apparently so great that it has spawned a separate industry whose job it is to (arduously) look past the shallowest surface of a prospective employee:

""Zoller, who used to work at a staffing agency, started her business because ""I saw women coming in to this agency, and they had great résumés, but they weren't getting jobs because they didn't know how to dress.""""

My god, what a horrible predicament! If a woman does not understand which clothing she is expected to wear in the office, how could she possibly be intelligent, industrious, or competent? This is not only a pathetic admission because it shows how important dressing to company norms and dressing 'to one's gender' is. It is also a statement about business-as-usual in an economy with a perpetual army of unemployed workers. The employer-employee power relationship allows the employer to often make arbitrary decisions about hiring or firing based on personal bias or irrelevant factors such as political views or minor differences in fashion sense.

""Multiple accessories and bright colors should be reserved for an evening out with friends. The idea is to give the interviewer the impression that you are already part of their company.""

Besides giving the not-entirely-untruthful image of corporations as gray warehouses packed with thousands of uniformly-dressed employees chasing tiny slices of cheese on hamster wheels, this statement also tells us something about the way workers are meant to relate to their job. If one is to give the impression of being “already part of their company,” what comes with looking like a 'part of the company' besides the willingness to obey the orders of its bureaucracy?
It is obvious that a company looking to hire on this basis is not looking for hirees with any sort of creative perspectives or non-standard processes. Companies sometimes advertise for 'self-directed' workers, but this seems to me a simple euphemism for “submit without requiring supervision.” The company seems to place foremost value on the willingness of workers to conform to somewhat arbitrary dress &amp; behavior norms. Because full discussion of applicant skills &amp; perspectives is omitted from the important 2% of the interview, workers are also being judged on their willingness to accept some level of alienation from their produce. How could an interview be passed without discussion of the work itself unless the relationship of a worker to her work is perceived as irrelevant?

Specifically he lived in Zurich from the 1880's-1921. When Vladimir Lenin was exiled from Russia one of the many places he went was Zurich, Switzerland. There was a big to do about the fact that an exiled revolutionary from Russia was in Zurich. My great grandfather found out and then went and got transcripts of Lenin's speeches that  proceeded his exile. My great grandfather read the transcripts and then went and sought out the works of Marx and Engles. After much research he became a communist. After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 my great grandfather decided that his family would move to the first Soviet to participate in the social revolution that was to follow. However before he had pulled the trigger on that decision the Russian Civil War broke out. Fearing for the safety of his wife and children my great grandfather waited in Switzerland for 3 years (until mid 1921) for the civil war to end. Doubtful that the civil war would end or that the Soviet would be in ruins upon its conclusion, he capitulated to his wife's suggestion that he instead move the family to New York. So in mid 1921 he moved his family from Zurich to New York and thus my family became Americans. Shortly after (not more than a year and a half after) the civil war ended. As the family story goes, my great grandfather always regretted the decision to leave Switzerland instead of waiting for the Soviet to reach a peaceful state, and vocalized his regret until his death in the 1950's.

1347419531.0	zqwy7	Allende's Last Speech		37	8	5	" Santiago de Chile, 11 September 1973, 9:10 A.M.

This will surely be my last opportunity to address you. The Air Force has bombed the antennas of Radio Magallanes. My words have neither bitterness but disappointment. They should stand as a moral castigation of those who have been traitors to their oaths: Chilean soldiers, titular commanders-in-chief, Admiral Merino, who has designated himself commander of the Navy, even more señor Mendoza, the cringing general who only yesterday manifested his fidelity and loyalty to the Government, and who also has named himself Director General of the Carabineros. In the face of these deeds it only falls to me to say to the workers: I shall not resign!

Standing at a historic point, I will repay with my life the loyalty of the people. And I say to you that I am certain that the seed we have surrendered into the worthy conscience of thousands and thousands of Chileans, will not be able to be reaped at one stroke. They have the power, they can make us their vassals, but not stop the social processes, neither by crime nor by force. History is ours and is made by the people.

Workers of my Nation: I want to thank you for the loyalty you have always had, the confidence you placed in a man who only was the interperter of great yearnings for justice, who pledged his word to respect the Constitution and the law, and who did so. In this final moment, the last in which I will be able to address myself to you, I want you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital, imperialism, united with reaction, created the climate for the Armed Forces to break their tradition, that which they were taught by general Schneider which was reaffirmed by commander Araya, victims of the same social sector that today will be be expecting with an alien hand to reconquer the power to continue defending their profits and their privileges.

I address myself to you, above all to the modest woman of our land, to the campesina who believed in us, the mother who knew of our concern for the children. I address myself to the professionals of the Nation, to the patriotic professionals who continued working against the sedition overseen by their professional academies, classist academies that also defended the advantages of a capitalist society.

I address myself to the youth, to those who sang and who brought their happiness and their spirit to the fight. I address myself to the man of Chile, to the worker, to the campesino, to the intellectual, to those who will be percecuted, because in our country fascism has now been present for several hours; in the terrorist assassinations, blowing up the bridges, cutting the railways, destroying the oil and gas pipelines, in the face of the silence of those who had the obligation to behave.

They are in jeopardy. History will judge them.

Radio Magallanes will surely be silenced and the tranquil metal of my voice will no longer reach you. It is not important. You will continue to hear it. I will always be together with you. At least my memory will be that of an upright man who was loyal to the Nation.

The people ought to defend themselves, but not sacrifice themselves. The people ought not let themselves be subdued or persecuted, but neither should they humble themselves.

Workers of my Nation, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men will go beyond this gray and bitter moment when treason tries to impose itself upon us. Continue to know that, much sooner than later, we will reopen the great promenades down which free men pass, to construct a better society.

 Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!

These are my last words and I have certainty that my sacrifice will not be in vain, I have certainty that, at the least, I will be a moral lesson to castigate felony, cowardice, and treason.

I know that posting US specific news in this subreddit is frowned upon, but I think that this particular case is worth discussing as it has major implications for the US and the world. 

In the last couple days, as I'm sure most of you know, major revelations have come forth about the vast extent to which the US government is spying on our people -- everything from the NSA to major corporations like Google and Microsoft collaborating with the government to expose every single thing that we do online and on the phone.

This is no surprise. But what is interesting to me is that traditionally liberal subreddits like /r/politics, /r/news, /r/technology, etc are absolutely enraged by these new findings. The sentiment has turned overwhelming against not just the government in general but the Democrats who have pushed forward this domestic spying. Top comments have literally been calling for revolt against this unjust system that is fucking everyone over. These subreddits, populated mainly by middle class white Americans, are calling for the end to the current US government. In my opinion, that's a pretty big deal.

I think that this is worth discussing, as it provides an opening for communists to agitate. How best can we engage with this?

On a similar note to the internet security culture links that have popped up in the last couple days, I saw this great comment today on /r/technology that I think folks should see:

1361343088.0	18vh75	On r/communism's need for more lively discussion and debate	RageoftheMonkey	43	14	24	"I initially wrote this in a comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18v4a6/lenins_tomb_on_male_privilege) but it is something I've been thinking about posting for a while and figured it deserved its own thread.

I've been thinking a lot in the past couple weeks that more controversial things need to be posted and argued. I feel as if this subreddit has fallen into somewhat of a rut where most of us agree on most things and many posts turn into some sort of upvote frenzy of (often pretty basic) Maoist analysis. If all we do is agree, what good is this forum?

We need to have more lively debates and discussions. This means posting things that are controversial and that frequent posters here might have differing analysis of, but that are still very much related to the broader topic of communism. Note that I do not mean posting liberal arguments or anything, just different Marxist analysis.

For instance, that was actually my explicit intention when I posted [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18n2k5/what_do_folks_here_think_of_veganism_and_the/) about veganism and animal rights a few days ago (though I of course am also very interested in the issue and people's responses to it).

As /u/JustAnotherBrick reminded me in the first thread I mentioned, the discussion about North Korea in the past week or so has been very interesting, if for no other reason than that many people here have different opinions about it and we could have a lively debate.

Tl;dr Let's avoid getting stuck in an uncritical rut. We need to consciously strive to promote good, varied discussion and debate so that we don't unconsciously devolve into a Marxist version of a traditional Reddit circlejerk.

Edit: Or here's another way to look at it. Instead of just posting controversial things, look at something like [this recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18v7t4/are_3d_printers_the_foundation_for_localized_post/) on 3D printing. Instead of just downvoting it into oblivion, let's discuss it! If nothing else it would be interesting. Let's put some new life into this subreddit."	t5_2qolz	True

See, I have become used to making passionate speeches and to be emphatic about the struggle of the working class. So when I see reactionary bullshit and wrongheaded claims which aim to undermine this struggle of course I will react very passionately. I used to find this powerful - I think revolution itself is not a dispassionate affair - I think that communism as a whole is something meant to deeply move people - for it is their liberation which is at stake.  

And yet, when I make passionate arguments in the middle of discussions which are pertinent to working class interests I get constantly chastised for not being dispassionate and stoic - as if these are the highest qualities one should have. It seems that a passionate argument cannot be rational. Even when there is nothing wrong with what I said, and what is worse, when the interlocutor IS wrong and I am able to point this out, it seems I am at fault simply because (even in writing) it seems that I am not completely emotionally withdrawn?  

Is this what we should require of socialists? That we distance ourselves completely from that which we are discussing, which is so pertinent to our lives? Is that even possible? It seems to me that those who are able to do so do not really have a stake in the whole thing. I generally find this attitude to be more prevalent amongst pacifists - but should we really chastise anger amongst comrades?  

I mean, ""let the ruling classes tremble"", but will they tremble at the sight of stoic masses, who will rise up dispassionately?  

If rationality is not determined by appearance, why should we care about appearance so much? Why is it more important than content? Why is passion not persuasive anymore? Should I be overly concerned about not offending the precious sensibilities of those who are in the wrong?  

Tell me comrades, are we allowed to be angry?  

I need to know, because if we are, then chastising anger is just an excuse to run away from a fight.  "	t5_2qolz	True

&gt; The New People’s Army adheres strictly to the principles and instruments of international 
humanitarian and human rights law. We must expose as false and malicious the propaganda 
campaign of the enemy that the NPA is systematically recruiting children who are less than 15 
years of age to become combatants.

This is in stark contrast with the resolution reached by the PCP Shining Path, that 'human rights' is just a liberal idea made to mask every day oppression.

What do you think about this? I think it's positive as it builds counter-hegemonic support for the PPW among more liberal-minded sectors of society, and I don't know enough about it, but this is arguably a lesson from the failure of the Peruvian experience. Or is this right-opportunism? Should we care what liberals think?

I wound up writing like 12 pages double spaced in Word about the subject, so I figured Id come post it over here and see what people thought about the subject matters. Ill post the intro here and a Mao and Stalin post each. I would greatly appreciate my comrades input, disagreements, further insights, comments, and thoughts. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

First realize that Stalin and Mao very very different people, in different countries, with different supporters, and different cultures. Its a vast over simplification to say ""communism"" where in reality both are dealing with their adopted form of communism for their particular state. Maoism and Stalinist (a morph of Marxist-Leninist).


Additionally before we begin I would like to make a personal note. The capitalist west has long tried to hold onto the moral high ground. Where this sense of superiority comes from I have no idea. The capitalist west is largely built on slave labor, with the deaths and suffering of BILLIONS OF PEOPLE on its hands. You think all those fancy things and all the money and capital and goods weren't extorted and raped out of the rest of the poor ""uncivilized"" word? You think it doesn't continue to be so? If you truly think that the West's hands are coated in any less blood you are very very mistaken. I dont say this to justify anything that happened under the Soviet Union or the PRC, but when approaching the topic of ""evil and vile men"" its always good to realize that your position is built off of such evils, and your way of life is fed by the blood and suffering of millions of people worldwide. The true difference I see in most peoples interpretation of the moral question, is that in the SU you died without a choice, while in the USA you choose to die, or that the dying takes place somewhere else by someone else. In the case of the SU the perception in the west was that power was completely invested in one person, so all the guilt must fall to that one person, where as in the USA and other western countries we elected our leaders and thus our guilt is distributed. The argument for Stalin and Mao is as much a practical one about proving some degree of innocence (or at least not total guilt) as it is an ideological one on educating the audience enough for them to get past the preconceived notion of absolute power in one person, as well as the historical contexts of the time.


Lastly, about myself personally. Its always good to know the angle of the person you are getting an answer from. I am a communist, the science is one of beauty the more you investigate. Interpretation of history is always done through the lenses of your own personal beliefs. My investigations into the history of the Soviet and Chinese administrations, and the historical (and that includes pre-communist rule) context of actions gives me enough proof to be mitigating factors in my judgement of Stalin and Mao. Maybe what I show you after wont be enough for you, but do consider your own judgments and where they come from and why. I dont believe that looking away from things changes them, but I think that the closer you look the more things start to differ from the ""approved"" version.

*Person was asking if failures of past communist states mean that Communism is a failure*

this is a common misconception regarding communism; largely stemming from the idea of the ""end of history"" by Francis Fukuyama that since the soviet union fell, capitalism wins forever and everyone is happy, in addition to remnants of McCarthyist fear-mongering. If one reads the works of Marx one would know that a communist government has never existed in history. Communism is the end result of years of work and systematic change which has never yet been realized (mostly because capitalists *shockingly* like to hold on to their power and will fight any change with a vengeance). 

just a quick explanation of communist evolution. some people on this subreddit may not agree, but it is commonly held (and espoused by Marx) that only a country with a developed system of capitalist production will be fit to enter the transition stage towards Communism, that being Socialism. Marx believed in a Socialist system of Direct Democracy where the common man had direct influence in all matters (which was established in Russia before the betrayal of Lenin by Stalin &amp; the bureaucratic elite). in this state many systems of governance and society would be administered by the public (thereby being held accountable to the people). such a Socialist system has already taken root in many successful nations and is proven extremely effective. 

with many lower functions of society administered by the state (all citizens ensured public health, education, welfare and other rights of society) people; not having to worry about weather they will be able to feed their family that week or what have you, become more free to pursue higher goals and self fulfillment (see [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg/450px-Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg.png) )

that end state is communism, in which the state ceases to exist as a coercive force and humans are free from bondage to seek higher goals.

Now getting back to the USSR and China, Imperial Russia at the time of the revolution was a feudal society and not ready for the transition to classic socialism, but Lenin and his compatriots sought to augment Marx's theories to fit Russia's unique situation. In the end they were marginally successful in setting up a proletarian democracy (the term ""soviet"" comes from the various democratic communes that made up the nation), but soon they where bombarded not only by Imperial forces but also Western invaders. following Lenin's death, Stalin used his influence to pervert the soviet bloc model into a bureaucratic dictatorship with himself on top.

From this point on, the Stalinist USSR began suppressing all foreign communist movements that where not Stalinist in nature, leading to the rise of a number of ""Communist states"" influenced by the Soviet Union (more or less). As for Russia's eventual fall there are a myriad of reasons, from overexertion Militarily, to bureaucrats making uneducated decisions ext...

I guess my point is that ideas cannot die, and like anything else we learn from what we have done right and wrong in order to improve the system (remember democracy was thought dead time and time again for thousands of years before the modern era)

In fact it is not communism that suffers from inevitable failure but Capitalism. Capitalism by its nature is ultimately unsustainable. The West only continues to trudge along the way it is because of the large scale exploitation of developing nations. Capitalism can continue to attempt to fudge the numbers and pull it self out of its periodic crashes (which have been getting larger &amp; larger since the 70's mind you, culminating with today) but this is getting more and more difficult, and will eventually become impossible. Not to mention rapidly declining resources as well.

1340678487.0	vlwwc	The beginning of a new idea concerning an analysis of North Korea.	bradleyvlr	42	9	15	"As a Marxist, I typically detest the idea that an occurrence, especially where a society is concerned, happens as just an anomaly. However, I, and several other comrades, push the discussion on North Korea to the side without much of a thought saying something to the effect of ""North Korea is a strange place."" Now I do not consider myself an expert on North Korea, nor do I consider myself even an expert in Marxist analysis. I had an idea recently while trying to research a bit of North Korean history that may or may not be of merit.

It is important when concerning a matter dialectically to begin with where a society is coming from. Korea is historically a nation (or two or three) that has ranged from regional empire to victim of imperialism to several centuries of isolation. One would think foreign rulers might be talking about modern North Korea, but the Korean Empire for a good deal of the 15th through 18th centuries was dubbed the ""Hermit Kingdom."" Korean self-reliance is a cultural trait that extends a long time before the advent of Juche. Now at the beginning of the 20th century Korea was occupied by Japan with brutal conditions forced on the workers who were exploited to create wealth for the Japanese empire. The Japanese empire tried to suppress the Korean language and destroyed many cultural artifacts to combat the independent spirit that had become ingrained in Korean culture. This occupation continued through several uprisings until the end of World War II.

After World War II, Korea was taken from Japan and divided into North and South Korea meant essentially to serve as colonies for the victors. The rather arbitrary division and the former inter-connectedness of the Korean economy exacerbated the contradictions between the newly developing socialist north and the newly developing capitalist south. This began the Korean War in 1950 barely 5 years after the creation of the two states. The end of this war brought with it isolation between the two Koreas which was necessary due to the incompatibility of the two systems. 

Kim Il-Sung became a popular figure in North Korea especially due to the idea of self-reliance, which was, to a culture utterly raped (both figuratively and literally) for the past 50+ years, uniting and hopeful. Due to objective factors such as 1950's Moscow style bureaucracy providing the blueprint for political development, and the ever-present existential threat posed by the nearby imperialist nations requiring the massive expansion of the state and military, the North Korean bureaucracy (largely with the support of the population) grew quite large. Over the next few decades, with imports of resources and technology from the USSR and China, the planned economy was able to industrialize North Korea very quickly. It wasn't until the seventies when the South began to receive imports of capital from imperialist nations that it was able to match the North in industrial capacity. It was also around this time that North Korea was having trouble managing its economy with a centrally governed authority, so its development plateaued, though still at a very high level with a decent standard of living.

In the early nineties, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the complete collapse of the economy in North Korea. North Korea relied heavily on oil (as does every industrialized nation) and the sudden embargo from all imperialist countries shut down all manufacturing. Even fertilizer in North Korea was produced by machines requiring oil (just like all industrialized nations) so a famine swept through the country. Immediately following this, Kim Il-Sung died, leaving the North in a crisis of leadership. As happens in every country faced with a deep economic crisis with a state apparatus in crisis, either there is a revolution or the state consolidates even more power. So Kim Jong-Il came to power on top of the now massive state apparatus and decimated third-world economy. An interesting side note here, is that the rates of starvation and malnutrition at the worst point in North Korea were still not as bad as decent years in India and some other capitalist nations.

As much as I personally hate quoting Zizek, I remember him saying something about when an economy stops working is when the state needs to portray leaders as super-heroes. This explains largely the cult of personality developed around the dear leaders (though that did begin before the economic collapse just not in as disgusting of a manifestation).

Now this is nothing new, though I just recently learned most of it, but here is where my analysis is going to differ from typically advanced notions of North Korea. Following the collapse of both the means and modes of production, North Korea had three resources, those being a rather large population/workforce, land that is somewhat fertile, and an immense, well-armed military and state apparatus. The important thing for both the survival of the state and the people was to end the famine and begin production of food on any scale; desperation was a key factor.

Now other areas of the world where unworked land was settled and no technological advancement had begun, what developed tended to be a slave society. Look, for example at annexations of the Roman empire and, most notably the colonies in the southern part of what is now the United States. The southern part of North America was, similar to North Korea, where the three main resources were guns, laborers and land. The development of resources relied on vast amounts of compulsory labor with the minimum advancement of capital. The class system in these instances developed differently, however. It is important to note that there is no slave owning class in North Korea, so the fact that it developed without private property does make it qualitatively different from these past slave societies. I will assert, however, that the modes of production, and most importantly the development of the slave class, mirror those societies closely enough that North Korea can most correctly be identified as a new slave society rather than a socialist, state capitalist, feudalist, or any other description.

The most obvious incarnation of the slave class is in the prison camps, where malnutrition and human rights abuses are reported from even the anti-imperialist sources (to be fair, the lack of knowledge of North Korea makes every source unreliable). This is where a steady stream of dissenters, criminals, and people disliked by the regime are sent to labor under horrid conditions for no pay under physical compulsion, that is slave labor. These slaves are watched over by government officials, or people without power themselves, carrying out the interests of those above them. These people and their class interests mirror those of the paid overseers in other slave societies.

Now, the more interesting, and less clear cut, case is that of those in the DPRK incarnations of the iron rice bowl. Under Mao, the iron rice bowl would be a fairly self-contained society, where people would farm and be provided for on the basis of each collective. That is, people would get health care, food, shelter and other necessities through the collective and even be provided for in retirement. In the instance in the DPRK, the rights of the workers in these collectives are suppressed to the extent that their work becomes exploitative and compulsory. And the general lack of food implied the theft of the workers in the iron rice bowl to provide food for those in the government and the model city Pyongyang. 

Now, what marked past slave societies as progressive in their time, such as Greece and Rome, was the development of a class freed from the draining requirements of mundane labor. In the past, this led to an explosion in art, literature, philosophy, and science, due to leisure time given to those in positions of privilege. In the case of North Korea, there are many brilliant scientists, military professionals, health care professionals, and other academics. While these people all operate under the control of the state, their academic achievements are possible on the basis of being provided for by the legions of those under compulsory labor. And though it is difficult to gauge the successes of those due to the isolation of the new ""hermit kingdom,"" the fact that many of the missiles used by Iran, and other developed capitalist nations are made by North Korean technology and manufacturers implies a good deal of competency by those granted privilege in the DPRK. 

Unlike Rome, Greece, and the 18th century southern United States, the DPRK is under an ever-present existential threat. Consolidation of political power was far less important in other slave societies (especially because the slave owning class had all of the political and economic power already). This is why these classes are manufactured and controlled by the state apparatus. This removes the typical manifestation of class contradictions and renders the oppression due to the bonapartist regime (bonapartist because it is defending the interests of the privileged class, which, without the state wouldn't even be conscious enough of their privilege to maintain it over those in the communes and prison camps). 

Thus, North Korea is a neo-slave society kept functioning by a powerful bonapartist regime.

This idea occurred recently while reading about North Korea in an attempt to understand what is going on in that odd country. Clearly this is not a well developed theory, and I would like input from others before attempting to develop it more. Of course, I am completely open to the idea that I am wrong about everything I said. Maybe I'll be on to something, or hopefully, at the very least, I can serve as a catalyst to generate discussion on the path of the new hermit kingdom."	t5_2qolz	True

I've recently taken the time to read through it and whilst doing so I found Sayers' discussion on the Hegelian tendency for existence to be looked upon in terms of the ideal quite interesting. I apologize for the lengthy quote:

&gt;The existing order is regarded as the imperfect and partial embodiment of the Notion or Ideal which is its real essence, truth and ultimate destiny. The established order is measured against this Ideal and found wanting. The scientific attitude of studying what is, is abandoned, and the world is judged and criticized in the light of how it ought to be.

&gt;I will illustrate these points with some recent examples; for the
Young Hegelian approach has not been confined to Hegel’s disciples
of the 1840s. It has had an enduring influence, and appears in some
unexpected places. For example, in the Marxist tradition; and even
amongst the hardest of hard-liners, who would be horrified by the
thought that they had much in common with the early Marx, let
alone with Hegel! It is particularly evident in the discussion of what
used to be called ‘actually existing socialist societies’, like those of
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (Bahro 1978). Often it is said
that these societies were not ‘genuinely’ socialist, that they were not
‘true’ workers states. Of course, they existed in fact; but, in true
Hegelian terms, what is being said is that they were not as they ought
to have been, they did not embody the concept, the notion—the
ideal—of socialism: they lacked ‘actuality’ and ‘rationality’. Some
people now say that since these societies had nothing to do with
‘true’ socialism, their demise has no implications for Marxism.

&gt;The manifestly non-ideal character of ‘actually existing’ socialist
states was, and is, one of the major problems for contemporary
socialist thought. An all too common response on the left has been
to try to evade this problem by discounting these societies as
‘exceptions’ in the ways described. But this is clearly not a satisfactory
response. It involves abandoning altogether the scientific approach
to history and adopting instead a purely moral one. There can, of
course, be exceptions in history; but when history comes to be entirely
composed of them they cease to be exceptions and become the stuff
and actuality of history. The ideal is then revealed as unreal, utopian
and subjective.

&gt;Not that this style of thought is any monopoly of the left. One of
the stranger products of the American far right is a writer called Ayn
Rand, who propounds an extreme and simplistic brand of laissezfaire
individualism. Among her works is a book with the arresting
title, Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. However, the title is designed
not simply to capture attention; it accurately reflects the theme of
the book. The ideal of capitalism is ‘unknown’, she believes, because
it has not yet been tried! The essence and the ideal of capitalism is
the free market. Capitalism, as it has existed for all these centuries—
‘actually existing’ capitalism—has never realized this ideal. Laissezfaire
and the free market have always been restricted and
compromised, she thinks, by excessive state interference under the
influence of muddled and weak humanitarian do-gooders, etc. The
destructive features of capitalism—the exploitation, stagnation, alienation, oppression and misery associated with it—are all the mere
aberrant and monstrous products of the mixed economy. Pure
capitalism, the ‘unknown ideal’, would not be like this.

&gt;To write history in this way is, of course, absurd. Socialists,
however, are in danger of precisely similar absurdities when they
reject actually existing socialist societies as ‘exceptions’, and persist
in thinking of socialism as an ‘unknown ideal’.

&gt;It is not the job of history or of the social sciences to criticize or
condemn societies according to ideal standards: rather, they should
seek to understand and explain the real world as it has in fact
developed. The social sciences, that is to say, must reconcile themselves
to the world, and avoid what Carr calls the ‘might have been school
of thought’ (Carr 1964:96). Socialists, in particular, must confront
the real world of socialism and come to terms with it, rather than
dismiss it as an aberration. In saying this, I must stress, I am not
suggesting that they should abandon all criticism, and simply endorse
everything that has gone under the name of socialism.

Cults of Personality, such as those that surrounded Lenin, Stalin and Mao in Actually Existing Socialism, are frequently used by liberals to demonise socialism, communism and even Marxism, placing them alongside the abhorrent and anti-People ideologies of Nazism and Fascism in the dubious political category of 'totalitarianism'.  

The reasoning behind these personality cults from liberals (and this includes anarchists who make use of liberal, idealist analysis) is that they are a necessary consequence of the Vanguard Party, conjured up by the new political elite to enslave the minds and all other aspects of life of the people and consolidate political power for its own sake. As Marxists however, I think our analysis should be considerably more developed and rigorous. 

Thus, I think this discussion should not just be about whether CoPs are 'good' or 'bad' - though that should certainly be discussed - but how they arise, how; or whether, they should be combatted, whether they are in keeping with Marxism and the historic struggle towards Communism, whether they are necessary or desirable in the Developed World or a phenomena belonging to the Developing World; where the remnants of feudal culture and social relations are stronger than in America, Britain etc. and the effect it has on the formation of the Dictatorship of Proletariat are also interesting issue to discuss. 

Comrades may also wish to take a look at [this](http://www.massline.org/SingleSpark/Theory/P-Cult-Ranga.htm) and [this](http://greatleapforwardspeed.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/the-red-herring-of-the-cult-of-personality/) for some further insight into the topic, but be wary of the fact that the former is considerably longer than the latter.

...

&gt;&gt;These measures will of course be different in different countries.

&gt;&gt;Nevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable...

&gt;&gt;[measures one through nine]

&gt;&gt;Ten: Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &amp;c., &amp;c.

So let me get this straight: the liberals were all for [Malala Yousafzai](http://www.marxist.com/imt-sympathiser-shot-in-swat.htm) going to school (btw follow the link for proof that she is an IMT sympathizer, which is not mentioned at all in most coverage of her). But if she was made to work in a factory 20 hours a day, they'd be all for it?

These people are disgusting. If not even children can be spared from exploitation, then what chance do adults have?

In reality however, the Communist Parties of India are gaining ground. Their reactionary political coalition is losing ground every day and it's getting to the point where the leftists may actually overtake the reactionaries in terms of popularity:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_general_election,_2009

Look at the results. Back in 2004, the Communist Parties only had about 7% of the vote. In 2009 they won 21%. They are severely marginalized politically in India, where the current perceptions still pretend that there are only two major parties/coalitions. Please be sure to express solidarity with the plight of our Indian, Bangladeshi, and other developing nation comrades whenever the issue is raised. I'm sure it would mean a lot to them if their existence is recognized and our support for their causes are given. They have done a lot when it comes to women's empowerment and anti-racism efforts (against caste systems and racial stratification, which were largely [invented/supported by British imperialists](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/38426/WP03_BATES_RaceCaste_and_Tribe.pdf)).

Letting our comrades abroad know that we exist and that unlike some liberal fools, we actually support their efforts to combat child exploitation, would be very reassuring to them. The UN estimates that over 2 million Indian children die from malnutrition every year before reaching the age of 5. Here's to hoping that the ones that DO survive can actually go to school and get an education instead of being kept illiterate and impaired both physically and mentally in factories.

If anyone has any further questions about the situation in India feel free to inquire.

Although I believe that communists should be agitating amongst the masses in order to grow a revolutionary organization: a) an internet forum (especially reddit) is not a place where a successful revolutionary organization can be built; b) the primary stage of agitation should concentrate on the ideologically advanced section of the proletariat and it's pretty clear these questions come from a petty-bourgeois positionality (i.e. like the recent peaceful transition crap worrying about revolution). As Engels said about the petty bourgeoisie: ""This class is entirely unreliable except when a victory has been won.  Then its noise in the beer saloons is without limit.""

So what do we make of these questions that, if anything, belong in r/debateacommunist?  A concerted liberal attempt at trolling?  Grumpity liberals-who-think-they're-radicals parachuting over from r/socialism?

(Also, as an important aside, those of you who are involved in revolutionary organizations that do practical work amongst the masses, be careful with these questions.

1332717565.0	rdbsh	So today I met a Libertarian...	JustAnotherBrick	36	7	37	".. and he gave me a bunch of books!

But let me start from the beginning.

My family enjoys going to the NC Fairgrounds to walk around the open air market there (the ""flea"" market). I also enjoy this, and am looking specifically for a copy of State and Revolution, so I take my time looking through every bin of old books I find. After a few hours, I go inside (there is a gigantic indoor complex for more permanent businesses, or businesses with lots of merchandise), and find a libertarian bookstore. I figure I won't find anything, but I look around anyways. The bookstore is attached to a pet shop which is also owned by the same person.

There is an entire section of the store dedicated to Ron Paul and other Libertarian writers/works. As I start to snicker with my family about Ron Paul's bravery (r/circlejerk shoutout!), I spot a corner that is simply classified as ""The Enemy."" I waltz over, and it is filled with books about Communism. Not just those critical, but mostly books by actual communists. It was a great moment.

I could feel the beat of my heart rising. I began visibly sweating. My brothers asked me what was wrong, and I shoved them away. They ran. My father worried, but I was undeterred. I grabbed about ten books (If only I could have grabbed more!) and made out like some sort of sweaty, shaky bandit. It was an absolute steal.

Twenty five bucks later, I came out with this fine selection of books:

[Essential Works of Chinese Communism, The Communist Manifesto, An Essay on Marxian Economics, On Socialist Ideology and Culture, Some Questions Concerning the International Tasks of Our Party (Le Duan), Capitals One Two and Three, Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung, and The German Ideology](http://imgur.com/a/TM9RD)

along with a long list of Libertarian Websites and Causes. I also got a business card.

I couldn't find any Lenin or Trotsky or Stalin, but I would totally recommend the place to anyone seeking Communist Literature. They still have lots of it left. Just piles of it. And its all cheap. About $2-3 per book.

1331933718.0	qzyte	Educational Post: What is Capitalism?		32	5	25	"Hello comrades!

This is a mod-approved *educational self-post.* It is intended to be a platform for discussion about a particular topic of Marxian theory. I do not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I have been asked to start what is meant to be an ongoing series. I'm going to open up a discussion about the Marxist definition of Capitalism. This is obviously truncated for space. Also I'm probably going to make some mistakes, and feel free to offer corrections or thoughts. This is meant to generate discussion! For the full definition, please see Marx's completed works and all Marxist theoretics generated since he stopped doing it himself.

One of the things I've noticed about discussions of Capitalism on leftist reddits is that the definition is often vulgarized and reduced to a single condition. The most common of these single conditions in my experience is the ""ownership of the means of production,"" which takes some form similar to a claim that under capitalism the means of production are in private hands but under communism they are in public hands. Another common reduction is to an equation of capitalism with a market for goods. None of these reductions are correctly Marxist. For Marxism, Capitalism is an aggregation of instances and conditions, some of which work in concert, and some of which are in opposition. The phrase for this aggregation is ""mode of production,"" a fancy term for the way a society makes things and reproduces itself.

The Capitalist mode of production is a system where relations between people are based on the production and exchange of commodities. A commodity is a useful thing that is produced for the purpose of exchange. The point of the exchange is to realize the value created in process of making the useful thing. That value is not realized and collected by the majority of the people who made the useful thing. Instead, the majority of the people who do the work making the commodities sell their labor power to someone who owns the stuff that the people who work need to use to make the commodity. That stuff that you use to make the commodities is called the ""means of production"". 

The people who sell their labor power are called, as a group, the proletariat or the working class. The people who buy labor power are called, as a group, the bourgeoisie or capitalists. Labor power is traded on a market like a commodity. Labor power is applied to the means of production (sometimes called fixed capital) and the stuff that is made is alienated from the people who exerted the labor to make it. That alienated labor is then, in part, sold by the capitalists back to the workers from whom it is alienated.

As the workers labor on the means of production, value is created. All of the value created beyond the amount of value needed to reproduce the workers (provide for the stuff that keeps them alive) is called *surplus value*. When the commodities are sold, this surplus value is realized by the capitalist as profit. That profit is then re-invested into the system in order to make more profit. Thus, Capitalism is as system where the amount of value is *expanding*. It needs to grow or it ceases to work.

Again, this is a brief summary. But it's important to remember that all of these things are part of Capitalism. For the Capitalist mode of production to function, all of these conditions are going to be operating. This is important to understand as revolutionaries because it helps us to envision what socialism, the transitional mode of production between capitalism and communism, can look like.

1369677233.0	1f5c4a	There has always been one thing about capitalism that bugs me.	CanadianCommunist69	40	13	13	"One of the things that bugs me about the capitalistic way of life is the amount of investments you're forced to make to supply yourself with food and shelter. You have to invest in your future career by paying thousands of dollars for college level education just to end up being worked over by the bourgeoisie. All that happens is someone is investing in their career to pay back their student loan which leads to a load of high paid workers only working for money and not working towards the betterment of the citizens. In many socialist societies, education is free on all levels which eliminates the doctors, lawyers, etc, working to pay off their loan and not working to better the community. It's no surprise that some socialist countries have the best doctors and workers because they are doing it to better themselves and the community instead of hoping to earn enough to one day pay off the debt they've accumulated. It's no surprise that there is such a gap in the class levels when the citizens are forced to invest in an education.

Everyone always says that upper stage communism will not work due to humanity's inherent greed but that is nothing aside from capitalistic drivel. The capitalist society in which we live in make us feel this way because we are forced to care for no one but ourselves and immediate family. If we eliminate the need for capital in our society, we become better people that work for the good of the nation, not our wallets."	t5_2qolz	True
1369433276.0	1ezx8o	Why I'm No Longer An Anarchist	JokeTwoSmoints	49	22	61	"so after being a communist for a little while when I was around 14 after reading some theory, I eventually ended up compromising my beliefs to the point of being a typical Democrat and liberal by the time I was 16. I embraced capitalism and all things to do with private ownership to try and 'open my mind' and fit in to my community, in a way. But I started reading Marx, Engels, Lenin, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Proudhon and soon became an anarchist because I thought that strong central government could do anything right, even in the right hands and led by competent leaders. In a rejection of what I saw as the 'evils' of statist communism, I became an anarchist. Until the other day, however. I really stepped back and looked at what anarchism offers and what communism offers. They both want a classless society run by the workers. However, anarchism has no viable methods of taxation, military, social services or ways to guarantee that the principle of 'from each according to their ability, to each according to need' is in place and protected. Anarchist societies can only work in a peaceful, small setting as long as everyone agrees to cooperate. The idea of no government is a tantalizing fantasy, but it would not work very well for the most part. So I went back to look at Lenin's ideas and theory of government, and I've seen the light! His ideas are more practical than anarchist theorists' philosophies, and he understood how to govern in a way that would actually be effective. I don't like some of his ideas or how he ran the USSR, but I think that overall Leninism is the approach towards creating a communist future that has the most potential.

TL;DR Was a communist, changed my mind a few times, realized that leninism lays the best groundwork for a classless, worker run society. Anarchism is foolish shit"	t5_2qolz	True
1369127126.0	1er65y	How can capitalism overcome this crisis?	ksan	38	10	20	"This might seem like a silly question, but I'd love to hear your opinions.

The basic premise is this: assume this crisis is caused by an intense fall in the rate of profit. You can also, if you will, assume it's caused by an overblown rate of profit that cannot be put to use productively (what I think the Monthly Review folks say). I think in either case the fundamental problem is: the cycle of capital accumulation is not working. People with capital are not being able to make (enough) money, and when they are it's usually through unproductive schemes that end up exploding in their faces.

OK.

So the question is: assume capitalism can do anything it wants to fix this issue. Further exploitation of the third world, proletarianization of the first world, wars, you name it. What can it *actually* do to fix this mess?

It seems a clear trend right now is to transform into proletarians large masses of the first world (Southern Europe, etc), but I fail to see how this won't backfire through a pronounced drop in the demand for consumer products. Surely their problem wasn't a lack of cheap of labor before? This could be countered by making the remaining ""consumers"" fall deeper into debt, but I'd say we just came out a huge crisis where that kind of strategy was the last step before the collapse, so it seems unlikely at this point. What else? Wars? Physical destruction of capital? I've heard people saying banks in Spain are thinking of actually destroying houses to maintain their prices.

Be creative! I'd love to have solid answers to this question."	t5_2qolz	True

And I posited to wonder why people don't see that as propaganda (well, the majority of Americans, not all people, of course, we see it for what it is).  They would berate all the Soviet Propaganda posters but fail to see that they're awash in propaganda from every second of their lives.  It's due to the political hegemony of the current system.  

And I was thinking about this car dealership in the same neck of the woods that have 3 humongous flags (like, they bought out the 9/11 Supply of Uber-Mega-Giant-Patriot-flags or something - it makes Donald Trump jealous), and why that's not considered propaganda, and of course - they would argue that it's private action, not government sponsored (again - hegemony - at least that's how I see it).

But you know that if these same Americans were to see Soviet flags hanging out of a Soviet house that they would say it's all ""State Propaganda"" and people don't *really* believe in the Soviet Union and they are displaying it because they're forced to or are afraid to not display it (or something of that nature).  

So I was actually wondering about this.  There's this really perverse flag-flying thing in the US, and I don't know how other countries are in that regards.  And more specifically what about the Soviet Bloc... Was there a lot of ""private"" flag displaying going on in the Soviet Union?

There's been a group of strictly sectarian third-world maoists who have been critisizing our postulates to increase the minimum wage, because in the third world they earn a lot less. They call us nationalists for wanting a better life in our own country, which is allegedly part of the richest 20% of the world population, and ""ignoring"" what happens in the third world, despite remembering and celebrating important dates in the workers' movements in the third world, altough they critisize even that, because ""remembering revolutionaries like Ibrahim Kaypakkaya by a first-world bourgeois organisation like this is hypocritical"".

The problem is, they literally have no life. They spent 24 hours on Facebook trying to argue with leftist organisations, and they write (or as I suspect, they copy and paste) large paragraphs about how fascist we are. They live in large mansions, they are themselves part of petty-bourgeoisie, they deny fighting for workers rights in our own country, and they boycotted the general strike which happened today.

I am quite confused. Should we basically ignore them or try to argue with them? Most of our members work and it's really hard to find time to argue with people who are prepared to never go off the internet. And it's really discouraging to listen to critisisms by self-called communists on everything you do.

Maybe you have some good articles which would help in polemics with them? Or maybe some good arguements to prove that they are nothing more than dogmatic sectarians who only stop our working class from being conscious? Anything would help, really..

Recently I was banned without warning from r/communism. Upon messaging starmeleon asking what the deal was, he said ""it was a mistake."" I thought that was very strange timing because at the time I was in a debate where I was trying to explain my views on division within the US working class, particularly with regards to racism. I know my viewpoint has never been popular here but I always thought that I could still engage and debate users so we could mutually benefit and learn some new things.

I think I can safely say I've always been extremely polite to other polite when chatting with them, and even when users were expressing opinions that were totally wrong like support for Obama I was very careful and kind to help them learn. I thought I could expect the same attitude from my comrades, but upon explaining my views on racism within the working class, here are some of the responses I got: http://rcomrades.blogspot.com/2012/12/marxism-and-oppression.html#comment-form

""Nah, you're just a racist, bro. You can try and use bad social investigation to defend your white power politics, but that's what they are. White workers don't benefit from racism, what a joke! I'll go to my job tomorrow and watch the minimum wage guys all drive out to job sites, and I will note that they are ALL Latino and black (no seriously, ALL you motherfucker. One hundred fucking percent.) while all us white people in the office make multiples of that. As I bicycle home from work, I will notice that 95% of the people with nice bicycles on the trail and who wear racing kits are white, but that 95%, (yeah 95% you racist piece of shit) pf workers riding shitty bikes in old tshirts or contractor shirts are latino or black. And then, since I'm not a motherfucker, I won't come home and try to convince other radicals that white ain't no material thing. But you, you are a motherfucker. Fuck you. I think I know who you are on reddit, and I've asked you nicely to open your eyes before, about men and non-men, and you refused. In fact you lazily googled to try and find reactionary shit to support your nonsense. I have no more patience for you. You are obviously a two faced evil fuck who thinks a romanticized imaginary working class is more important than the real working class. I have no time for people like you, people who use radical theory to justify white power structures. You literally make me sick. Bro."" - thechurl

""Yeah LH needs to be fucking banned from here and the subreddit. Remember that this is a person who when faced with a very cogent argument for third worldism, freaked out and went to RevLeft to seek counter arguments.""- DZDZ

Since thechurl is a member of the moderation team, I can't help but assume that he's probably the one who banned me. And even if he didn't, I'm sure he would most certainly like to judging by his comments. What great irony that someone with a Maoist flair would rather ban users without warning than adhere to the principal of self-criticism.

It makes me fucking laugh that these two people accuse me of trying to uphold when privilege when **I literally did not say a goddamn thing about upholding white status in capitalism, nothing, not a single, I only pointed out that trying to say white workers were not qualitiatively proletarians was erroneous. I even said that black workers had the right to be suspiscious of white workers, and that all victories won by the working class have crossed gender and racial lines. It's hilarious that people cannot confront my arguments and must instead resort to making character judgements about me. I remember thechurl told me to google statistics on female labor, and when the statistics I found contradicted his viewpoint, he totally ignored me and said I was a brainwashed male.**

It also makes me laugh that they try to use my Revleft membership against me, as if that somehow can substitute for a counter-argument. **Yes, I went to Revleft to expand my knowledge on Marxist theory, I'm such a white supremacist asshole!** The funny thing is that, for all their sectarian bullshit, the userbase of Revleft actually know a fuck of a lot more about Marxism then about 70% of the people here.

Despite whatever slander may be thrown upon me, **I have never tried to justify the ideology of white supremacism. All I've done is gather factual statistics and economic information to prove that the concept of white workers being materially different was wrong. I've even admitted several times that whites do face less oppression, but my point (As you can see in my debate in Bradlervr's pacifism thread) was that this did not expand their class power and bit them in the ass overall. If anyone says I have defended white supremacism, then they're either stupid or lying.**

I've sensed that /r/communism has been going down the path of third-worldism for a while now. This board is full of people who have probably never even read Marx's Capital and probably prefer to spend their time reading Maoist blogs about how evil white people are. Ever since our cooperation with SRS we've had an influx of users from that board who don't know anything about Marxism and are instead molding the theory to fit their own preconceived notions of race and gender. It makes me sad because this place used to be one of my favorite places to discuss communist theory and I found the userbase very insightful, but it looks like those days are over. I'm not going to stick around in a place where I'm harassed as a person, where my viewpoints are misrepresented, and where not believing that white people are evil exploiters makes you racist against black people.

I'm sad that it has to end on this note. I've met many people whom I consider very intelligent and good friends, and I'll always remember what they taught me. I want to tip my hat especially to people who may have disagreed with me but still managed to speak to me in a comradely manner and conduct civil discussion like JMP, because that's how it should be done. And for the people who prefer to spam images of South American rebels instead of talking about theory who are probably glad to see me go, well, fuck you too.

Whatever happens, I still wish you all good luck in your educations, and when the revolution comes I hope to see you (Unless you're trying to kill me for being white)."	t5_2qolz	True

Guess what asstrumpet, after the doxxing of that fascist violentacrez and the exposure of his close personal ties with the reddit admins, the fact that it is part of a huge private corporation, the several websites that sell voting manipulation products and other services to help advertise on reddit, the utter refusal of the admins to handle the pedophilia, racist, misogynist forums and their open defense of them as free speech, you don't get to pretend none of it happened, pretend you're uninformed, and try to spin it like you do. Reddit is a cesspit and you're defending the cesspit. At least you were honest enough to do it while openly out of character, but you're still an awful fascistic loser.  

[So I don't know what a reactionary is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/147fx8/i_took_this_spy_photo_over_in_rcommunism_pinko/c7apny2) You should look at yourself in the mirror. Reactionaries are those that advocate a return to a prior mode of production, along with its superstructure. Now you don't even have to accept the premise that socialism is more advanced to realize that your mates constantly reproduce a bunch of feudal prejudices. But I don't blame you, you probably went to the same shitty school as the guy above. (wait until the loser complains and gives a dictionary definition as the ultimate theoretical explanation)   

[You can't tell if I'm being facetious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/147fx8/i_took_this_spy_photo_over_in_rcommunism_pinko/c7akcns) Well guess what, WE CAN TELL THAT YOU AREN'T! And that's the saddest thing. You are legitimately offended at leftist politics, you are just a juvenile right wing loser who thinks that they are a genius because they reproduce the most banal dominant discourse. All of you losers claim victory but you can't get over the fact that you didn't manage to take us down. You are truly offended by my post and by the resilience of this forum, a place for leftist politics, a place for dissent. And you won't have any dissent will you?  


You could never be so sophisticated enough to notice the irony of what you are doing.  

Anyway, guess what. You LOST. You now have a tarnished sidebar which has to claim that you do not advocate downvote brigades and you [had to retreat to IRC](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/147d3z/mod_post_new_operating_instructions_for_all/). r/MURICA HAS RETREATED.  

Whine some more, losers. It just proves my point. You are just offended and trolled by the existance of this forum, which challenges your hegemonical rightist discourse. /r/communism still standing is the biggest in your face FUCK YOU you can get.

This is the kind of shit that you see all the time on there nowadays. For a while there seemed to be a remission where it was actually okay to be a Marxist-Leninist, but now the so-called ""Anti-Stalinists"" are back in full force. There's really not even any discussion of theory on that website, it's just, ""How do we convince people that Marxism-Leninism is a bourgeois ideology?""

Look, I know the USSR wasn't perfect. I don't think I ever said it was perfect. In fact, I would criticize anyone who called it perfect because no society is a perfect realization of an ideal. But for ultra-leftists, the failures of the Soviet Union aren't opportunities to learn, they're proof that they're much smarter than those dumb Marxist-Leninists and their state capitalism.

The above is a table and two graphs, both put in one large PDF file.

Hello, I am a Non-Sectarian Communist. I have seen some very seen some very bad Sectarianism, which made me want to look into the other Leftist Subreddits out there. It is my hope that through this report, we can each come to terms with each others differences, and unite to combat capitalism. **Please Read the Personal Plea at the bottom.**

Here are my findings.

**Procedure:** 

* I used Metareddit to find as many Leftist subreddits as I could.

* Here, I define Leftist as Social Democracy and anything farther Left than that. I realize some joke subreddits were caught in my net. Just go with it.

* Once I had my subreddits, I found out the number of posts in the last 29 days, and the number of comments in the last 29 days, as well as the size of the subreddit (in subscribers).

* I used 29 days instead of one month because when a post is labeled ""one month old"" on reddit, it could actually be 30-56 days old, and I was worried about outliers messing with the data.

* In my report I have eight fields: Name, Subreddit Rules/Sidebar, Personal Commentary, Size, Posts in the last month, Comments in the last month, Comment to post ratio, and Activity Index.

* Name: The name of the subreddit.

* Subreddit Rules/Sidebar: The official rules or statement.

* Personal Commentary: My own interpretation or observation of the subreddit. Note that many of these I am a complete foreigner to, so my commentary is either poor, small, or missing entirely.

* Size: The size of the subscriber base.

* Posts in the last month: Posts made in the last 29 days.

* Comments in the last month: Comments made in the last 29 days. This data will be slightly off, due to ignoring recent comments in posts older than 29 days.

* Comment to Post Ratio: The Comments divided by the Posts in the last month. the Specific formula is Comments/(Posts + 1). One was added to posts to prevent a Divide by Zero error. It did not impact the data enough to justify its removal.

* Activity index: This is a ranking of the most active subreddits. Each was given a number based on the activity of submitting and discussion. The specific formula is (Posts/29)+(Comments/29)

**Findings:**

**/r/communism**

* Size: 3129

* Posts in Last Month: 261

* Comments in Last Month: 2020

* Comment to Post Ratio: 7.11

* Activity Index: 78.66

I am proud to call /r/communism my home subreddit. It is the one I check eagerly everyday. Even though I am not the most perfect communist, whenever I slip and fall, the community always picks me back up and helps me learn from my mistakes.

**Fun Facts**

* Total Subreddits analyzed: 87

* Highest Activity Index: /r/Anarchism

* Lowest Activity Index: Too many tied for this position. Many Subreddits have just stopped.

* Highest Comment to Post Ratio: /r/Pyongyang. I experienced some weirdness when investigating this one. I reviewed all the subreddits multiple times, and when I came back to this one, the amount of posts was always changing. This data reflects two posts, each post having over 200 comments.

* Second Highest Comment to Post Ratio: /r/DebateaCommunist. One of my Favorite subreddits, it will always be in my heart.

* Lowest Comment to Post Ratio: Again, too many tied for this :(

* Largest Subreddit: /r/Anarchism 

* Second Largest Subreddit: /r/FirstWorldAnarchists

* Third Largest Subreddit: /r/socialism 

* Smallest Subreddit: /r/SRSAnarchism

* Weirdest Subreddit: /r/PonyAnarchism. It was a tie between this and /r/Capitalist_Communism

I believe that we can revitalize some of these smaller and more inactive subreddits. To this end....

**Some Smaller, More Inactive Subreddits that /r/communism Might Like**

Just as a note, I realize that some of these are not that small or in active.

* /r/Agitation: Here, users post links to reddit threads. The point here is to go to those threads and engage the users, who are usually in need of education about Socialism, Communism, or Anarchism.

* /r/alltheleft: Trying to unite all the left!

* /r/Debateacommunist: Another beloved subreddit, it can be fun debating!

* /r/Anarchy101: Like /r/Debateacommunist, but with more anarchists!

* /r/askacommunist: Very small, but has great potential.

* /r/CPUSA: In the United States? New to Communism in the states? CPUSA is here to welcome you!

* /r/Hoxhaism: Could use more content and users.

* /r/IWW: The international Workers of the World! A great organization, their subreddit isn't too bad either. But it needs help growing!

* /r/Leninism: Same as Hoxhaism.

* /r/marx

* /r/Marxism: I feel that we should take better effort to improve the quality of this subreddit.

* /r/PrisonReform. Seriously, why isn't this more populated? Who doesn't want this?

* /r/redstatereds: I know your out there. I'm stuck in the South, who else is with me?

* /r/RuralLeft: Same as /r/redstatereds, just more dead.

* /r/RiseoftheSovietUnion: I haven't checked this place out too much other than preliminary research, but it appears to be a series of lectures about the Soviet Union. Might be worth checking out.

* /r/ShittyDebateCommunism

* /r/smallrevolutions: Revolution in the palm of your hand! With more activity and users, this could be a great subreddit for organizing communes and coops.

* /r/Socialism: we could use some more representation here.

* /r/SPUSA: This place is dead, but I know some of you SPUSA members are on here. Go fix it up!

* /r/anarchocommunism: This one has a brand new mod. Get in there and support him. Even though we are Marxist Communist, I feel that we could add to this subreddit.

* and many more!

**Personal Plea**

I know that those of us who favor /r/communism do not have the best reputation. I seek to change that. The only way to Revolution is if we go together. Live together or die alone. That is the hope behind this report. A hope that the left can unite.

If you have seen my thread on /r/Socialism, you know what is coming. I think that we should go out there, and in a civil manner engage our detractors. We have a great subreddit, that actually has had good moderation. I have never been banned for disagreeing with the group. I don't think that I have even seem this happen.
We should go out there to places like /r/Marxism, /r/Marx, /r/Socialism, and /r/Communismforall and others and show that /r/Communism is not only dedicated to Marxist discussion, but it is also for *everyone* to come and learn from that discussion. It is our duty, as members of /r/communism to cooperate and organize with other communists, even if we disagree on things. Solidarity is our most powerful weapon, and we need to arm ourselves.
I realize that most of the people who are turned off from /r/communism are turned off because they disagree with the rules. We must continue to educate them, but also to welcome them into our forum. In my opinion, we must thrust these people to the front of the revolutionary movement, for surely they are in great need of education. To that end, I suggest we relax. Just to be clear, I am not suggesting a relaxation in the moderation policy. The mods have been firm, and that is why we are a success. Look into my report, and look at the activity indexes of most Anarchist subreddit. It is clear that the mods have done an excellent job. I feel that we need to in crease our efforts to treat visitors with respect, to keep it clean, and to deal lightly with those who break the rules. If we are to teach and correct those who make a mistake, we must do it with good character. We must be kind and courteous, even to assholes. If they are not kind and courteous, they will be banned, but we must make them understand that we are not the aggressors in that situation.
Well, thanks for letting me ramble! I hope something good comes of this.
I am sorry, I am not trying to tell /r/communism how to act, I am merely trying to heal the wounds and division in our Leftist Community.

Ultimately, what I want is to unite us and heal this division.

I am sorry if I offended anyone, or otherwise caused a negative reaction. That was not my intent.

Prepare, comrades. A new dawn is upon us. When the masses reach /r/communism, how will it turn out?"	t5_2qolz	True

""When the delegates from Germany arrived, probably at the beginning of September, they were to find the atmosphere in the Soviet capital transformed by the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the approach of the German October. The city was covered with posters appealing the young Russians to learn German
in order to serve the coming revolution. Passionate meetings were being held every day in factories, schools and universities on the theme of the help which the German workers would require. Bukharin was applauded by the students when he called on them to throw their books aside and take up rifles. Resolutions passed by mass meetings in factories declared that Russian workers were ready to give up increases in pay and even accept reductions in order to help the German Revolution. Units of the Red Army declared themselves ready to fly to the help of the
revolutionary Germany, to do their duty as the 'vanguard of the world revolution', and addressed resolutions in this sense to the German workers. Two special funds were opened, a gold reserve, and a grain reserve. For the first, they were asked women to give up even their wedding rings. For the second, the commissariat for
trade planned the formation of a 'German reserve' of 60 million poods, to be stored near the western frontier. The Political Bureau ordered the Party units to seek out members who knew German, in order to set up a military reserve that could serve as 'international brigades' in Germany. The Communist Youth enthusiastically prepared for the revolutionary struggle; it would be the battle of their generation. The press coined the slogans and hammered them home: the alliance of the 'German pile-driver' with 'Soviet bread' would conquer the world, and create a power of 200 million people, against whom no war would be possible.""

- The German Revolution, Pierre Broué, pages 758-9

The revolution failed. Germany, with the help of the bourgeois class, would eventually be dominated by Fascism, and less than 20 years later would invade the Soviet Union in a campaign of extermination against its people.

We can try, though, and one way of roughly defining their character would be to say that Left Communism is the pure, vibrant, no-compromises, no holds barred version of your old run-of-the-mill Communism. For instance!

- All Power to the Soviets! Organize all of society through federated working class councils! No power to the Vanguard Party, no Democratic Centralism!

- Permanent World Revolution! Workers of the world unite! No bourgeois national self-determination! Destroy all frontiers and barriers, they are just the shackles the capitalists have fastened your feet with!

- No cooperation with capitalists, reformists or centrists! Down with the reformist trade unions, out all moderates from our organization!

- Down with Parliamentarianism! Elections lead nowhere but to gradual reform and decay, don't play into the hands of the ruling classes.

So, that was a bit tongue-in-check, but you get the idea. Famous Left Communists, who didn't necessarily agree with all those ideas, include [Rosa Luxemburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg), [Karl Liebknecht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Liebknecht), [Antonie Pannekoek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_Pannekoek), [Amadeo Bordiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeo_Bordiga) and many others.

Were Left Communists vindicated by History in their early criticisms of the Soviet Union and other socialist states? Do you support the self-determination of oppressed nations, even if it's through a purely bourgeois revolution?

Obviously given the choice between a pro-Saudi Sunni Islamist government or a pro-western military coup a nationalist left-wing government would be the best choice. But as communists how much should it be supported? And I guess there has to be some examination of Nasserism of Nasser's day and Nasserism today. The historical version of Nasserism, and Arab Socialism generally, seem like an Egyptian version of Nehruism/Congress but less liberal and missing the elitists trappings left over from Fabianism. I don't think it is a petty-bourgeois movement(An insult which is over used against left-wing political movements) because the drive to a national economy delinked from Europe would be harmful to and not in the interests of Egyptian small business owners. Maybe on some level it is an Egyptian interpretation of pre-Cold War, but post-1917, social democracy. This view I think ties it closer to Congress in Indian, explains its domestic anti-communism, and accounts for the degradation into Mubarak which makes the prospects of a new Nasserist government seem less than hopeful. But then modern Nasserism might be purged of any neoliberal tendencies thanks to the failures of the Mubarak and having to reengage the masses. At the same time the economic program he implemented was far closer to the Soviet system than anything even old school Social Democrats would be willing to accept.

Also as somewhat of a side topic, I think a large chunk of explicitly left-wing movements today are more the children of Nasser than Lenin. Specifically the ones in Latin America. Also, while he is obviously not on the left, Putin's regime has elements of this ideology I think but this is not a thought I have given a great deal of attention to.

&gt;The opponents of communism have always described it as a process of sharing things out equally. They declared that the communists wanted to confiscate everything and to divide everything up; to parcel out the land, to divide up the other means of production, and to share out also all the articles of consumption. Nothing could be more absurd than this notion. Above all, such a general division is impossible. We could share out land, horses and cattle, money, but could not share out railways, machinery, steamboats, and various other things of the sort. So much for that. Furthermore, such a division, as far as practicable, would not merely do no good to anyone, but would be a backward step for mankind. It would create a vast number of petty proprietors. But we have already seen that out of petty proprietorship and the competition among petty proprietors there issues large-scale proprietorship. Thus even if it were possible to realize such an equal division, the same old cycle would be reproduced.

&gt;Proletarian communism (or proletarian socialism) is a huge cooperative commonwealth. It is a sequence of the whole development of capitalist society and of the condition of the proletariat in that society. It must be carefully distinguished from the four following things [I've omitted the other three]

&gt;1. Lumpenproletarian socialism (anarchism). The anarchists reproach the communists on the ground that communism (so they contend) will maintain the State authority in the future society. As we have seen, the assertion is false. The essential difference consists in this, that the anarchists are far more concerned with dividing up than with the organization of production; and that they conceive the organization of production as taking the form, not of a huge cooperative commonwealth, but of a great number of 'free', small, self-governing communes. It need hardly be said that such a social system would fail to liberate mankind from nature's yoke, for in it the forces of production would not be developed even to the degree to which they have been developed under capitalism. Anarchism would not increase production, but would disintegrate it. It is natural that, in practice, the anarchists should advocate the dividing up of articles of consumption and should oppose the organization of large-scale production. They do not, for the most part, represent the interests and aspirations of the working class; they represent those of what is termed the lumpenproletariat, the loaferproletariat; they represent the interests of those who live in bad conditions under capitalism, but who are quite incapable of independent creative work.

I thought that was very thought-provoking. What are your thoughts?

1354511126.0	146p92	Reactionaries are always the same.  	bolCHEvik	126	99	37	"You know the type. These losers from other subreddits who keep inciting invasions after their genius isn't recognized by r/communism's audience and they get banned for their pitiful shitposts.  

The kind that thinks that we are ""suppressing dissent"" in this forum. What the fuck do these people think dissent is? If it is deviating from the norm, from that which is officially supported by the government or even by what is deemed ""common sense"" by the status quo cultural norms, then this forum is fucking dissent. But these geniuses think that they are being brave dissenters by making use of their majority, with their brave ""socially accepted opinions"" (which is usually sexist, racist shit, or just capitalistic ramblings), and forming big invading mobs to shout us down.  

Yes, true freedom of expression for redditors is shouting down political minorities like they did to our subreddit, downvoting all of our content for the past 10 days out of the forum. And people wonder why we don't take these fuckers seriously or why we shove it in their face that their valued ""free speech"" is just a tactic to ensure that the majority (awful) opinions on reddit are always the ones heard, and the others silenced. That it is just an excuse to parade reactionary opinions on this forum.  

Nevermind that our latest invaders hide behind the pretense of being a parody filled with reactionary, sexist ""humor"". As anyone can see, its not just fake haha humor. When one of their own users [innocently suggests](http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/145fl8/liberation_missions/c7a2vsh) that the worst aspects of the sad, imperialistic terrorist state of America be made fun of (the whole point of their usual parody) - their prevalent real world islamophobia - someone runs in and reminds them that their serious, reactionary mccarthyist agenda is incompatible with that. We are dealing with more traditional cold warriors here who, when it comes down to it, are very serious about some kind of juvenile conservative, nationalistic internet activism.  

And what of the reddit admins? I'm sure their own policies against downvote brigades and this kind of practice that completely disrupts day to day activity in a political forum doesn't matter to them because they are a bunch of reactionary shits, who only after a huge community and real world outcry will timidly remove pedophile, creepshot, racist and other awful communities that their fascist audience breeds and upholds. I wonder if /r/murica invaded those awful subreddits all of the reddit reactionaries would take it in stride. Well I know they wouldn't, we saw how they defended these communities up until the last second as free speech.  

So we get it reddit. You have made it clear that when you mean free speech you mean reactionary, commonly accepted, majority speech, and nothing else. Any dissent from this is going to be reviled by the wider community and, as we saw in this latest forum invasion, effectively censored.  

And some of you in this forum will still try to score points with reactionaries in other boards when they complain about any moderation whatsoever. Do you think these fuckers would ever have anything positive to say about our community otherwise? The only compliments they would give us would be whenever we decided to drop any semblance of a communist ideology and accept their shitty uninformed arguments. For those comrades who rather than be principled and stand along with your comrades, instead try to score buddy points with the fascists in other forums when they complain about this one, a big fuck you.  

What all the efforts of these reactionaries reveal is that they are legitimately bothered, ""trolled"" if you will, by the existance of this forum. These fuckers are constantly offended at the existance of /r/communism , and this is by far the best aspect of it. And this is the most satisfying of all. They may hide behind their appearance of humor and parody, but they are just bitter, angry and frustrated (as it is often revealed after they are banned and they keep harassing us in private, and as is revealed by the threads in their forums, and by the politics in their posts).  

So to all the little proto-fascists out there, I suppose I don't have to say anything else, because this forum is the biggest fuck you to you all."	t5_2qolz	True

1351582343.0	12bu0r	I'm no stranger to positionality and privilege, but after reading some Dworkin and Fanon today I can honestly say I've never been so shaken down at the soul level (in a good way)	nathanielray	61	36	22	"* Background note: I'm a PhD student in a geography program which involves more social theory that you might have ever though possible. And I love it—one of the reasons I chose the program I did.

As per the recommendations in the recent [this-is-a-feminist-forum post](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/129qew/rcommunism_is_a_feminist_subreddit/) (yay us!) I checked out Dworkin's ""I Want a Twenty-Four-Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape"" and I also stumbled upon Frantz Fanon's *The Wretched of the Earth*. This has come after weeks of reading Harvey, Gregory, Gramsci, Rose, Smith, Thrift, Pred, and a whole bunch of other social theorist geographers of many flavors (not just Marxist, although many are). But nothing prepared me for the soul shakedown I got from the Dworkin-Fanon one-two punch.

Something in Sartre's preface to Fanon struck a nerve:
&gt;Fanon reveals to his comrades—above all to some of them who are rather too Westernized—the solidarity of the people of the mother country and of their representatives in the colonies. Have the courage to read this book, for in the first place it will make you ashamed, and shame, as Marx said, is a revolutionary sentiment.

The shame I felt was overwhelming, particularly after reading Dworkin's assertion that anyone who does not stand up against the currents of our rape culture (because that's what it is) are complicit to it: it's not enough to just *not rape*. For as long as I've been a critically-thinking being (which happened at some point in college), I've identified with feminism and social justice and equality. At the conservative university I attended, even expressing that sentiment was met with bewilderment and incredulity, and so I thought that that was enough, to say that Yes, I'm A Feminist—Ask Me About It like I was a member of some weird cult wearing a sandwich board on a corner downtown.

But that's not enough, and Dworkin awakened me to that; she shamed me to that conclusion. But, while it hurts or embarrasses or whatever the right word for the self-analysis that follows shame is, that has only brought me to action. Shame is a revolutionary sentiment because it causes a person to act (and what is the revolution without action, praxis?). Even though this first action is small—a self-post thread on a medium-small subreddit—it's something, and that's definitely more than the nothing I was doing before. (Well okay, not nothing. I do try to heap all kinds of revolutionary thought upon the freshmen that I teach in hopes of getting them to think more critically about the world and challenge the narratives presented to them [including mine.])

Fanon, which I read when I was already raw from Dworkin, had a different effect on me. Granted, I haven't read that much of it yet (just the conclusion, Sartre's preface, and the first few pages of chapter 1), but it has already helped address some issues I've had in the past. As I became socially conscious in college, increasingly aware of the myriad social inequalities around me and in my experience, I was strictly tied to the nonviolent revolution. Disclaimer: I've long since abandoned that vow but I've had long talks with my comrade who is a major part of his university's RSU about violence and what violence does and the nature of violence and the place of violence and everything wrapped up in it. My own research has even touched on some of these themes. What Fanon did for me though was to literally *wake me the fuck up*. 

When the revolution comes, when the revolution is brought about, of course it is going to be violent. That's the whole idea. Even the language of the communist revolution (both on-the-ground and in theory) utilizes violent language: overthrow, rise against/up, destroy, banish, oppressors, seize, struggle, losing and winning, reproach, haunt, exorcise—I could go on and on. But the point remains: when the exploited and downtrodden have reached that point where we cannot endure one more injustice and we will destroy the means, tools, symbols, and structures of our oppression, we will be met with fervent opposition; our violence in routing an entire system of abuse is born in the violence of those that have exploited us—they have sown the wind, we will be the whirlwind. Even if no one is killed, the revolution will be so utterly and transformatively *violent* in its realization that no stone of our society will be left atop another.

To be frank, the more injustice and inequality I see, the angrier I get and the more willed to action I become and at my most raw, unfettered, honest, and empathetic, I cannot fucking wait."	t5_2qolz	True

1336607171.0	tfkb9	Today, I found out my friend was a communist.	Technologenesis	37	12	19	"So, for most this will be a TL;DR, but I had to get this written.  It may not be well written.  My apologies in advance.

I'm 15 and in the 9th grade.  Years ago, I had the best group of friends I could ask for.  One of them was this really funny guy who was also an asshole now and then, but who I got to know because he was really good at drawing, which I was interested in at the time.  Then there was the super tall friend who was literally the most intelligent person I've ever met.  It's a close call between him and the Talented Asshole (in case he's reading this, I mean that in the nicest possible way).

Anyway, back then I was a Christian, and so was Tall Kid.  Talented Asshole was an atheist, and he was the first one to really make me question my beliefs.  Tall Kid and I would talk about our religion, and our lives, and our futures late at night before going to bed, and those are the times I remember most.  Often, Talented Asshole would join in as well.

Eventually, my tall friend changed.  He started hanging out with people I'd never really spent any time with.  He started saying and doing things I'd never seen him say or do.  I was forced to separate myself from him, and ultimately from the Talented Asshole as well.

Flash forward to September 2011.  September 8th.  I've just suffered a break-up with my first girlfriend.  My faith in God is crumbling and has been for months.  My faith in everything else is starting to crumble as well.  A man enters my engineering classroom.

After the years of friendship, the nights of hour-long conversations, the laughs, the companionship, the ultimate separation, had all culminated in this moment.

My Tall Friend was dead.  He had shot himself that morning between 7 and 8 A.M.

I broke.  The entire world changed from a bit on the cranky side to a full on douchebag, doing everything it could to pound my soul in.  I mentioned that I'd broken up with my girlfriend?  Who could give a shit now?

I began to realize God was not showing up for me.  The Talented Asshole and I were back on friendly terms, so I talked to him a bit.  Eventually, he asked me what I thought of communism.  I gave the usual ""looks great on paper, doesn't really work"" response, to which he replied that communism as it was intended hasn't really been put into practice yet.  At first I was tentative in my acceptance of socialism, but I came to accept it eventually.  Communism, to be honest, isn't something I'm ready to accept yet, but I may be based on what I learn in the future.

My newfound disdain for religion and hope in socialism caused me to see the people around me with new eyes.  I had changed, and I was starting to drift apart from the people around me.  I started even becoming angry with them when I would try to talk with them, because they weren't interested in what I had to say; they were just interested in beating it down.  Eventually I lost all motivation, all sense of belonging, and nearly all hope.  But the Talented Asshole and I remained friends.

Today, we were sitting in the locker room during athletics.  Discussing school.  Teachers.  The people around us who hated everything we believed in.  We talked about how everyone seemed to instantly reject what we said.  Eventually, we talked about our late Tall friend.

""He was a communist, you know.""

I looked at him.  I was realizing that My Talented Asshole Friend hadn't started communism in my city.  It went farther than that.  The people that were rejecting him and me, the teachers that made me feel like a piece of crap every day...  He experienced it too.  He too had drifted away from the people he knew.  He too lost his motivation.  Suddenly, the person I saw as moving from nice guy to hoodlum became more than that; a guy who saw the flaws that I hadn't and whose ideals I hadn't understood, but that I now did.

He was a communist, and the ones who were torturing me..l ultimately killed him.  And I had been one of them.

Anger welled up inside me, and still is.  I look at this world and see nothing but a floating ball of shit anymore.  The beautiful world of Jesus and capitalism had become... Well, a horrible world of Jesus and capitalism.  It hadn't changed.  I had.

They killed him.  They're damn close to doing the same to me.  But they won't.  The sacred war is going.  I'm not letting them win.

TL;DR: The guy I was friends with for years and who later killed himself my freshman year turned out to be a communist, and it pisses me off to incredible levels that it was people like me who killed him."	t5_2qolz	True

RedSolution	31	4	3	"""At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality. Perhaps it is one of the great dramas of the leader that he or she must combine a passionate spirit with a cold intelligence and make painful decisions without flinching. Our vanguard revolutionaries must idealize this love of the people, of the most sacred causes, and make it one and indivisible. They cannot descend, with small doses of daily affection, to the level where ordinary people put their love into practice.

The leaders of the revolution have children just beginning to talk, who are not learning to call their fathers by name; wives, from whom they have to be separated as part of the general sacrifice of their lives to bring the revolution to its fulfilment; the circle of their friends is limited strictly to the number of fellow revolutionists. There is no life outside of the revolution.

In these circumstances one must have a great deal of humanity and a strong sense of justice and truth in order not to fall into extreme dogmatism and cold scholasticism, into isolation from the masses. We must strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into actual deeds, into acts that serve as examples, as a moving force."" - Che Guevara"	t5_2qolz	True

We can more fully comprehend the present by studying the past. 

Both revolts, like the one in Sweden, are reactions to the anti-proletarian effects of neoliberalism, cuts, hopelessness, etc, on the one hand, and the oppressive state apparatus on the other. All three were launched after police murder and harassment.  

I would like to bring attention to two excellent, oft-cited MLM articles, [France's Proletarian Youth Erupt](http://www.aworldtowin.org/current_issues/32France.htm) by the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committee) of Canada, and [London's Burning: The Revolt of the Youth](http://www.revcom.us/a/242/AWTWNS_london_burning-en.html) by A World to Win News Service. 

The World People's Resistance Movement on France 2005:

&gt; It serves no purpose and is beside the point to dwell on the ‘imperfections’ of their rebellion. This is a spontaneous revolt of those at the very bottom who have taken the stage of history even though they have not yet had the opportunity to fully develop their political understanding, establish their political leadership and define a strategic course. Of course they are making some mistakes and of course the cars parked on the streets of the cités are not the true enemy. But… it is their way – for now – of showing this system, and those who run it, that they do not intend to abide by the rules nor allow their voices to be silenced.

Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committee) on the ""wrong targets"" of revolt in France:

&gt; Some “leftist” activists claimed that the rebels should not be supported because they hit “wrong targets”, and burned down schools. It’s no surprise that youth burn down schools when you hear stories like this one, from a young Algerian woman: “Right now, I’m looking for a school training programme. I went to see a guidance counsellor. She suggested that I become a maid. I’m 17 and she tells me to become a maid – that’s ridiculous!” In fact, even a union bureaucrat realised that “these actions are symbolic. A lot of trust is put in the school system, which is supposed to be a social elevator. To burn it down means that it doesn’t work. [Youth] turn against it because it deceived them.”

A World to Win on international influences in 2011 revolt:

&gt; But at the heart of this welter of contradictions, the force driving these rebellions is a sense on the part of the youth that it's a chance to strike back at the larger forces dominating their lives and oppressing them, and they're running to seize that chance. A group of four British-born youth of Somali origin heading for the fighting in Hackney Monday night talked of how they felt that they had no one that they could count on but themselves and their mates, that they might have to drop out of college due to the recent massive hike in education fees, and that they considered themselves ""revolutionaries."" One question in the air: how much were the youth influenced by the rebellions in the Middle East and North Africa?

On the contradictions and solidarity which emerges through common struggle:

&gt; The masses taking part in this revolt or out on its fringes are full of the contradictions that come from being part of capitalist society, but being in its most oppressed sections. In one housing estate in the center of the fighting in Hackney, one Afro-Caribbean mother lamented that the youth were getting away from the original cause of justice for Mark Duggan, and was especially upset at the looting of local shops, but when her son and his mates showed up with a bag of new clothes for her, she was delighted: I'm on benefits, we've got nothing, she explained. Mothers struggled with their young sons and daughters not to go out, but shouted with glee when they saw projectiles strike home on a police van. A middle aged Iraqi political refugee clutched to his chest his valuable personal documents that he’d salvaged, and worried that the car burning in the street might ignite his flat just above, but was torn by sympathy for the youth, who were up against the very same forces who'd turned his own country into a killing ground. An Afro-Caribbean woman and her daughters gathered around a burning dumpster singing Bob Marley's song ""Burning and Looting.""

EDIT: There are many more gems from Maoists who support popular revolt including in Brixton 1981, Los Angeles 1992, etc. I also recommend reading the articles in their entirety.

Petty bourgeois ideals of non-violent resistance are cute, but they operate on a few very disgusting assumptions. For example, look at the factory fire which happened in Bangladesh recently. 112 people were killed and the New York Times reports that the fire could have been avoided had Wal-Mart not blocked an improvement in safety conditions.

Now, if I were to kill 112 CEOs, I would get a death sentence, and liberals would suggest that I most likely deserve it because I am being violent in my opposing rich white males. However, nobody will ever call for a death sentence of the people at Wal-Mart responsible for the deaths of 112 innocent Bangladeshi workers. The assumption is that the wealthier privileged section of society has a higher valued life than the poor who are their victims.

(Marx - [Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 136](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm))

""The bourgeoisie, fully conscious of what it is doing, conducts a war of extermination against them. The workers will wreak terrible vengeance on the bourgeoisie no matter whether it wins for the moment or is defeated at once. After a battle like that of the three June days, only terrorism is still possible whether it be carried out by one side or the other."" (Engels - [Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 28](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/06/28b.htm))

""Above all, during and immediately after the struggle the workers, as far as it is at all possible, must oppose bourgeois attempts at pacification and force the democrats to carry out their terroristic phrases. They must work to ensure that the immediate revolutionary excitement is not suddenly suppressed after the victory. On the contrary, it must be sustained as long as possible. Far from opposing the so-called excesses – instances of popular vengeance against hated individuals or against public buildings with which hateful memories are associated – the workers’ party must not only tolerate these actions but must even give them direction."" (Marx and Engels - [Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm))

""It appears that the defeat of the Parisians was their own fault, but a fault which really arose from their too great honnêteté [decency]."" (Marx - [Letter to Wilhelm Liebknecht](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/letters/71_04_06.htm))

There's a lot more, but hopefully this will be enough to see Marx and Engel's position on the use of violence and terror during and after a revolution. These men were not ""respectable"" critics of bourgeois society, they were ruthless revolutionaries that understood the role that violence plays in the history of class struggle.

Most of the bans related to sectarianism have had long winded discussions about how it is justified or whatever and we waste a lot of time trying to be nice to people who actually haven't bothered to read our policies so we're making this easy.  
**If you say Stalin or stalinists aren't communist, you get instantly banned!**  
This counts for Lenin, Mao, Trotsky, Left-Communists too, but 80% of the time it's Stalin. So this is where we draw the line to separate us from the other leftist forums on reddit. Now when we ban sectarians we're just linking here and pointing to how instructions in the sidebar weren't followed, so it's their own fault.  
Help us fight rampant sectarianism that hinders discussion comrades!  
Let us criticize history and attempts to build socialism without resorting to cheap debating tactics, scare quotes, individual caricatures, and actually apply our critical thinking and knowledge.  
So people don't get to call whatever they don't like stalinism, denounce everything Stalin's government did uncritically and generally be an ass to other people who are welcome in this subreddit.  
**I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR**  
**ಠ_ಠ**  

Edit: **CRITICAL, POLITE ARGUMENTS ARE ALLOWED FOR EVERY DISCUSSION**  
What we want to avoid is people who triumphantly declare something that they disagree with ""This is Stalinism!""  
Or ""Ha! This is as shitty as Pol-Pot!""  
""Lol @ North Korea!""  
""Mao killed half of the living things in China!""
""Trotskyists never did anything!""  
""Leninists are authoritarian and thus we should reject them!""  
We DO NOT want to stifle discussion. We actually want people to discuss things, rather than keep denouncing them without presenting good arguments. Our policy is not meant to support Stalinism or whatever. You are free to voice your opinions that disagree with Stalinism so long as you do it from a marxist perspective and you aren't an asshole to Stalinists while you do it. The same goes for anything else you don't like, such as the IRA, Communist Party of Japan or whatever.  
  
Edit 2: To make this clear  
**R/COMMUNISM DOES NOT SUPPORT STALINISM OR ANY OTHER LINE**,  
we merely want discussions to escape the common place shitslinging that goes on in other forums and turn every conversation into something a little richer by forcing arguments to be more sophisticated.  
so **WE ARE NOT SUPPRESSING DISSENT**, we merely want you to voice opinions on the things you disagree with using more tact and more sophisticated arguments. **IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY, IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT**. You can present your criticisms of Stalin, and even complain about the people he killed, without merely pointing out ""Stalin killed a lot of people! If that isn't enough for you to not support him you're insane!"" and other assorted arguments about any other line that is also not stalinist that you disagree with. You can say ""Well, stalinism probably went more overboard with the killing, I don't know if that ended up being more important than whatever good the regime did over it's lifetime and ultimately stalinism was hurtful for the cause, but I understand that one can still rescue theoretical principles present within it"" or w/e. Get it? The point is not being an asshole.

I have a response I've been working on in my head, but I feel like it is still kind of muddled, and I was wondering if anyone had any insight or knew of any authors that have explored this concept:

Basically, it is my opinion that ""Communism doesn't work"" is really saying that ""Communism cannot compete with the output of Capitalism.""  Capitalist countries have never allowed communism to coexist - it's always been a competition to prove the other wrong and somehow push them out of existence (e.g. Cuba).  - Our blockade on Cuba has no purpose other than to hurt them economically as much as we can so we can then declare ourselves the victor.  But was communism ever intended to outproduce capitalism?  

To me it's kind of like a world in which everyone can take anything by physical force so they spend 8 hours a day in the gym.  If a small group of people say, ""hey it really is a waste of time spending 8 hours a day in gym - what if we just stop working out and instead spend our time doing things we value instead of endlessly trying to increase our muscle mass."" They are then left vulnerable to the body builders who can physically dominate them.  Does this prove we should all spend our time working out?  It seems like it is the existence of the brutes that forces everyone else to compete on the same terms.

1360648091.0	18d2hc	My thoughts on N. Korea and Western Views. Share yours	bowei006	31	7	29	"As we all here know. North Korea by definition isn't communist. But then again, besides maybe Laos and Cuba, the majority of states that identify as communist aren't that either. All states in the world use policies from various other systems.

But N Korea is often associated with Communism(as that is what they officially have) and so I think we should have an opinion on it.

My opinion on matters of the world are to be 3rd party viewership. To be babylonian. An eye for an eye. Right and wrong.

I personally believe and have seen that Americans really do not know the actual story of Korea.

Let's go back in time. In the 50's, N. Korea was actually by worldly views, the good guys. They were importing and getting good relationships with world super power to develop their economy for the betterment of their people. The South however was piss poor and under autocratic rule by a U.S backed dictator. N. Korea was a highly advanced state at the time undergoing industrialization and modernization.

What happened at the 38th parallel wasn't fair to the N Koreans. They liberated themselves from the Japanese and now they won't be able to get their country back? The term 'puppet' army has been used a lot during that time and in the films today. That term would best be applied to the S. Koreans at the time. Who were at the mercy of the dictator and U.S forces to fuel a proxy war that was ultimately wrongful imperialism.

So let's go into IF's right now. IF the PRC took the ROC and the DPRK took the ROK. The number of tensions would not be here right now. Right now the ROK and ROC and SOJ are pro U.S. But if that wasn't the case, the starvation in DPRK may not have happened.

Here's why. The Soviets and the Chinese more or less dropped support of N Korea after its failed war. It was too expensive. The Western powers would then go on to embargo DPRK and not give it oil. A needed substance that their industrialization needed.
This all happened because the war was not won. If the war was to happen without U.S intervention, it would have finished in a month.

With an unified country, the sporadic descisions of the DPRK may not have happened. With each blow to the DPRK after the failed war, their orders were more and more uncertain. If the ROK was taken, such anxiety would not have happened.

Those are my thoughts on N. Korea. Where Western Imperialism and hipocrocies in dealing with DPRK caused the current mess. Millions of soldiers and citizens would not have had to perished and the current situation with DPRK may not even happen as the DPRK would have more bargaining rights before the west illegally embargoed it.
---

Just today, I see 'media' reporting on how 'bad' and how evil it was for the N Koreans to set off the bomb. The views in the thread on N Korea's nuclear test all have good questions, but few actually make a point that I would like to see.

A unbiased view where you look at the issue as a 3rd party and not an American. 

They are mearley trying to get more bargaining power, secure their borders, and also get a nice alliance together.

But in Western Media views, it has all but just been twisted to seem that they are evil.

The Government has done some questionable things, but a crazy government wouldn't run. 

All to often, Westerners talk about reading between the lines, new info on how Hitler wasn't crazy, and War isn't about who is right but who is left. But when we get to a present debate, they read directly from the media, they call the government crazy, and that they are evil bastards.

The problem isn't actually with biased media. It's with media that doesn't care to give the facts of the other side. The info that is reported IS true. But it is so clean of info that it leaves the readers thoughts on that country to take over their senses.

This is something enviromentalists do. For example they can talk about millions of gallons of water used in fracking. The average reader would perceive this as being so much water being wasted and bad. They will thus rise up. But the actuality of it is, that the info was so clean that it will of course cause sensationalism. In this case of fracking, the water used  for fracking is 1/6th the amount used to feed animals and mine in the same amount of time while producing much more valuable resources and cleaner.

1357595189.0	1655fa	"Stalin and the ""British Road to Socialism"""	ksan	33	9	18	"Comrade [mza66](http://www.reddit.com/user/mza66) recently submitted to our reddit a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/15af28/george_thomson_from_marx_to_mao_tsetung_a_study/) to the book [""From Marx to Mao Tse-tung: A Study in Revolutionary Dialectics""](http://www.bannedthought.net/MLM-Theory/MLM-Intro/Marx2Mao.pdf) (PDF), by British communist [George Thomson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Derwent_Thomson). First of all, I finished reading the book today and I have to say this is an *amazing* introduction to Marxism. Thomson covers a lot of ground from an anti-revisionist perspective, his prose is clear, his style didactic and there's plenty of relevant and illuminating quotes by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Easily the best introduction (the book is about 100 pages long) to modern-ish Marxism-Leninism(-Mao Tse-tung thought, keeping in mind this was written in 1971) I have ever read.

But anyway, that's not what I was going to talk about. Reading his wikipedia page one thing caught my attention:

&gt; In 1951, he was the only member of the Communist Party's Executive Committee to vote against the Party’s programme The British Road to Socialism, because “the dictatorship of the proletariat was missing”.

""Interesting!"", I thought, a rare case of strong commitment to one's principles. Intrigued, I kept reading about this, jumping to the page about the [CPGB's programme itself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain%27s_Road_to_Socialism). There I found that, apparently:

&gt; The first edition of the document received the personal approval of Joseph Stalin prior to publication.

Considering the document called for things like:

&gt; Britain's Road to Socialism proposes that socialism can be achieved in Britain by the working class leading the other classes in a popular democratic anti-monopoly alliance against monopoly capital, and implementing a left-wing programme of socialist construction. Part of this strategy involves winning the labour movement for a left position, through struggle in the existing democratic bodies of the working class, such as Trades Unions, Trades Union Councils and tenant's associations.

it seemed odd for Stalin to support such clear case of Western revisionism. So I kept reading, until I hit a [marxists.org page](http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.postww2/index.htm) with a link to [some letters between Stalin himself and the Secretary General of the British Communists](http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.postww2/stalin-pollitt.pdf) (PDF). There, in one of those letters, Stalin advices Pollitt:

&gt; The draft of the programme correctly puts forward the task of utilising the traditional English institutions (Parliament) in the struggle for socialism. It is well known that the English Communists are being accused that they will establish Soviet Power in England. Hence it is imperative that in the draft of the programme it should be very clearly and definitely stated that the English Communists are not going to delegitimise Parliament, that England shall come to socialism through its own path and not through Soviet Power, but through Peoples’ Democracy
that would be guided by peoples’ power and not by capitalists; peoples’ power representing a coalition of working class as the leading force of the coalition, working intelligentsia, small and middle strata of the cities as well as farmers. The Communists must declare that this power shall act through the Parliament.

This seems pretty damning, and definitive. My investigation ends here, I just wanted to share with r/communism an interesting case of a communist leader known for its protracted fight against revisionism in the USSR openly endorsing an extremely obvious case of revisionism abroad (it really gets worse than this, with Stalin endorsing other practices such as voting for Labor in districts where the Communists could not present their own candidates, etc). So what do you think? Is this another case of people falling for ""Western exceptionalism""? Was Stalin just doing a bit of realpolitik, pushing for un-Marxist policies because they would benefit the USSR in the short term? Is there more to this that I'm missing?

They have talked a lot about great education, health care, working conditions, even the ordinary people were a lot nicer to each other. I was a bit confused, in my school the teachers told us that communist party were evil and only cared about themselves, when my family has said exactly the opposite, that the party cared about the people, and even lived in ordinary buildings (unlike today, when the party members live in separated villas), they kept repeating ""They cared about the people, not money"", and ""the commune' times were better"" all the time. I have discovered that my mum has been a teacher and my dad was a plumber in Poland PR, where as after counter revolutionists' takeover my dad had to immigrate to Germany, and my mum has been pretty much unemployed. Over 2 years ago they have divorced, and resulted in me, my brother and my mum immigrating to the UK. Around one year ago I found Polish communist youth website and read a lot of articles on it, and then I started asking myself a lot of questions - Would this all happen under socialism? Would all the wars and poverty exist under socialism? The answer was obvious - No. 
So I bought communist manifesto, and other books made by Marx and friends. I have joined the communist youth, and today I am working hard to prepare a good base for obvious revolution in the future.

DerRotarmist	30	7	13	"I'm a long-time lurker, rare poster, and member of a ""communist"" organization at my university.  I put quotation marks because, although everyone in the organization claims to be communist, I'm frustrated with how uninformed they are, and how uninterested they are in correcting that.  Normally, uninformed isn't a bad thing - it's just an opportunity to educate others, and learn something myself in the process.  But I can't get them to study basic theory or history, and it's rather embarrassing.

Here's what happened yesterday that prompted me to post: I was talking about my studies of the Russian Civil War with some other members, and got replies like, ""I didn't even know Russia had a civil war!"" and, even better, ""Wait, were the Bolsheviks the Communists or the Tsarists?""  I was taken aback, but suggested that we dedicate a meeting to studying the civil war, focusing on Lenin's, Trotsky's, and Stalin's writings on the matter.  Nothing too formal, just an introduction that wouldn't take longer than 30 - 60 minutes (our meetings are an hour.)  Some of the leaders in the group shot down the idea, saying, ""We're not a history class,"" and ""Theory is great and all, but we're about getting results.""  I argued that we can't be considered a communist group if our members don't even know the basics.  This isn't an isolated case, and I think indicative of a larger apathy to study: the group president has Che t-shirts and Socialist Realist art posters in his room, but has told me that he ""hasn't had the chance"" to read any Marx.

I've been tempted to just walk away from the group, and write the other members off as college kids who claim to be communists just for the shock value.  On the other hand, I feel like most, if not all of them, do agree with the principles of communism, and are interested in working for equality, just not disciplined in doing so.

In this era of imperialism and drastic exploitation of the third-world, qualities and actions of workers of the first-world/G20 are debated.

* Are first world workers exploiting third world workers? How may they do it consciously?
* How should first-world workers be classified? Are they proletarians or labor aristocrats?

These are some basic and maybe not very good questions. I do not know much about Third-worldism but would like to see some discussion and learn more.

The central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan announces with immense and profound sadness and sorrow the death of Comrade Hafiz, a central committee member of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan, to all the members and supporters of the party, Maoist parties and organizations of the world, and the entire international communist movement. 

Comrade Hafiz was a veteran of the new democratic movement in Afghanistan. He started his political and revolutionary activities in the ranks of the Sholajawid movement in the 1960s while he was a high school student. He remained committed to the line and objectives of the movement even after the movement’s collapse. When the Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) led the reprehensible April coup in 1978, and the subsequent Soviet social-imperialist invasion and occupation happened in December 1979, comrade Hafiz continued his revolutionary and national-democratic activities in exile.

In 1984, under the influence of the formation of Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM) and its political and ideological line, comrade Hafiz, along with several other comrades, formed the Committee for MLM Propaganda and Agitation that published the journal Shola. This journal played a significant role in the propagation of the Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In the late 1980s, when the Committee for the Consolidation and Unity of the Communist Movement of Afghanistan was formed by joint efforts of the Communist Revolutionary Cell of Afghanistan and the Committee for MLM Propaganda and Agitation, comrade Hafiz participated as the representative of the group under his leadership. The Committee for Consolidation and Unity expanded with the participation of the Marxist-Leninist Alliance--Mao Zedong thought faction and the Organization to Struggle for the Liberation of Afghanistan. 

In 1991, after the congress and the formation of the Communist Party of Afghanistan, Comrade Hafiz led the successful negotiation for the merger of the Committee for MLM Propaganda and Agitation with the Communist Party of Afghanistan and became a central committee member of the Communist Party of Afghanistan. For several years, Comrade Hafiz led an émigré committee of the supporters of the Communist Party of Afghanistan. In 1993 he was a member of the delegation of the Communist Party of Afghanistan in the second Expanded Meeting of RIM that ratified and issued the document Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism; in that meeting our comrade played a distinguished revolutionary role.

Comrade Hafiz was a representative of the Communist Party of Afghanistan in the 2004 Unity Congress of the Communist (MLM) movement in which he was elected as a member of the central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan. While leading an émigré unit of party supporters, our comrade significantly contributed to the party and the revolution. Over many years he played a crucial role in carrying forward the international activities of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan, both in relation to the activities of RIM and also as a contact of our party with particular Maoist parties at the international level. Comrade Hafiz was actively involved in the ideological and political propaganda for RIM; he had an active role in the publication of A World to Win, RIM’s journal and also RIM’s internal publications into Farsi-Dari.

The central committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan expresses its solemn condolences over the immense loss of this veteran comrade to members and supporters of the party, other Maoists of Afghanistan and the world. In particular we pay our tribute to the family of this comrade and express our commonality of deep sadness with them.

All the party units within the country and party supporters outside of the country, in accordance with their particular local and regional circumstances, are obliged to honor and commemorate this comrade’s death and celebrate his life achievements as a revolutionary within this month. Messages of commemoration within the country can be sent through party contacts and channels; condolences from outside of the country can be sent through party supporters or electronically through email to sholajawid2@hotmail.com.     

------------------------------

To the Central Committee of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan:

Dear comrades,

It is with sadness and deep emotion that we learned of the death of Comrade Hafiz, a Central Committee member of your Party and a dedicated activist and veteran of the communist movement of Afghanistan and the international communist movement.

The death of a comrade is always a loss for our movement, and it is even more when it occurs in a context like the one we face today in Afghanistan, where resistance to imperialist occupation is unfolding and requires a solid ideological, political and organizational leadership that puts the interests of the proletariat and the masses above anything else.

Everywhere in the world, the proletariat and the oppressed peoples are resisting the crisis of capitalism and the wars of aggression waged by the big imperialist powers. The aspiration to revolution and to a world free from any kind of oppression and exploitation has perhaps never been as extended as it is now.

On May 1st 2012, together with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Naxalbari) and the Maoist Communist Party – Italy, your Party issued an important call to build a new Marxist-Leninist-Maoist international organization. There is no doubt that the rich experience of Comrade Hafiz with the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM) will inspire and serve the formation of such an organization that our movement urgently needs.

There is no better way to pay tribute to Comrade Hafiz than to work for consolidating the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist parties where they exist, for building such parties in every country of the world, for unfolding the world proletarian revolution and building the international organization we need for leading it.

Please convey our deepest condolences to all relatives and friends of Comrade Hafiz, to his comrades, members and supporters of your Party.

To the Communist (maoist) Party of Aghanistan,

Dear Comrades,

It is with deep sadness that we learnt the death of Comrade Hafiz. Because we are proletarian internationalists, we consider every loss for the maoist movement of a particular country as our own loss. Especially with your party as we signed the joint 2012 May 1st Declaration.

As a revolutionary leade, Comrade Hafiz will inspire a new generation and the revolutionary seeds he sowed during his entire life will undoubtely blossom.

Our condoleances go to the entire Communist (maoist) Party of Aghanistan, to its sympathizers, to his familiy, relatives and friends.

Central Committee
Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan

Comrades,

We have learned of the death of Comrade Hafiz, an outstanding member of your heroic Party. 

The contemporary communist movement owes much to the work of Comrade Hafiz and its proletarian strong position within the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM). Comrade Hafiz was a strong Marxist-Leninist- Maoist, who played an important role both in his country as well as in the correct definition of Maoism as the third and higher stage of the proletarian ideology developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. 

We want to express our sincere sadness for the loss of this proven revolutionary leader of the Afghan people and tireless internationalist. Now, his example will be a new flame that will illuminate the road of World Proletarian Revolution.

The men and women who fight in Galicia (an oppressed nation within the Spanish State) to build the Maoist Communist Party of Galicia, pay a heartfelt tribute to Comrade Hafiz.

Convey our respect and affection to his comrades and family.

Revolution will triumph in Afghanistan!

Imperialist invaders out of Afghanistan!

LIMA – At least 49 people were injured Wednesday in the city of Abancay, capital of the southern Peruvian Andean region of Apurimac, during clashes with police who were trying to open an important road blocked by protesting teachers, media reports said.

The teachers, called out by a sector of the education union (known as Sutep), blocked the highway linking Abancay with the southern city of Cuzco early Wednesday morning, preventing dozens of automobiles and passenger transport vehicles from moving through the area.

The problem is that everyone seems to share their books through file-upload services like MegaUpload, Sharebee, Rapidshare, Fileget, and so on. These links expire quickly, and they're not very effective for easily sharing large libraries between people.

Large libraries can be shared easily through torrents on sites like OneBigTorrent, but there you have the opposite problem -- you can easily share big bundles, but it's harder to effectively share individual texts. 

In the past, I've done both of these things. I have quite a large library (500+ books), and I'm interested in finding some more accessible and efficient system of sharing it -- and of expanding that library and finding new books from others, because I too have a list of books I've been looking for and have been totally unable to find, like Fraser &amp; Wilde's ""Marx Dictionary."" I've also gotten into the habit of re-formatting PDFs and e-textbooks in ways more suitable for use on e-readers and mobile devices, which I'm sure there's demand for.

The best system I've found so far is a **Calibre library** served over the web. That option produces a neat little website [like this](http://i.imgur.com/uZS09tZ.png), where each book is downloadable in any of its forms (PDF, ePub, Kindle, HTML, plaintext) with a displayed cover and description. That's a great feature, because it means users don't need to have a book in mind -- they can see what's available and research what seems striking. They could email their own ebooks to the person running the library to expand it. The disadvantage here is that it's centralised and openly on display, pretty easy for copyright holders to simply order it shut down. 

My other idea was to cross-post a monthly thread in /r/communism, /r/anarchism, /r/socialism, /r/radicalchristianity, /r/criticaltheory, /r/srssocialism, /r/communism101, /r/anarchy101 (and so on) in which users can ask for books they've been after, recommend non-obvious books, and share their favourites or their collections (either through file-service links, or by forwarding them all to someone who posts them as one big convenient reliable torrent). There have been individual book-sharing threads here, but they get old, they attract no attention, they're not cross-posted between the various leftist/radical subreddits, and the links die off -- it needs to be a monthly thing, IMO.)

I'm curious as to whether anyone else has a better idea, and whether anyone else is interested. "	t5_2qolz	True

In actually existing socialism of the 20th century, efforts were made to curtail the dominance of the Law of Value  *objectively* as in the USSR in the time of Stalin and in the PRC in the time of Mao, particularly during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in consolidating the status of the proletariat as the ruling class.

Despite that, there remains an important discovery; Mao showed how the existence of the Law of Value represents the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, which continues in Socialism. This struggle is ultimately what Socialist society is about, and the main reason there is a so-called ""transition stage"" between capitalism and communism.

I would like to discuss this here. Is the Cultural Revolution and the different struggles therein the answer that is applicable everywhere? No one wishes to argue that there weren't massive successes, but can it's failure, in the final analysis, be ascribed to the material conditions of that time? 

In addition, i would like to make a call for more discussion on Political Economy. The modern communist is faced with a daunting task when confronted with bourgeois ideology. She must be proficient in everything ranging from philosophy to economics to history in order to be taken seriously by the hostile environment she faces after the defeat and the undermining of Actually Existing Socialism. Especially in the context of the current crisis of capitalism, reactionary bourgeois ideology is asserting itself more and more, and we must work hard to combat the shroud of mystification it brings with it. This cannot be done if communists everywhere arm themselves more and more with contemporary developments in economics, such as the TSSI. In the end, if we don't study these things, who will?

**The June Revolution
The Course of the Paris Uprising**

by Frederick Engels

Translated: by the Marx-Engels Institute;
First published: in Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 32, July 1, 1848;
Transcribed: by director@marx.org, 1994.

Gradually we gain a more comprehensive view of the June Revolution; fuller reports arrive, it becomes possible to distinguish facts from either hearsay or lies, and the nature of the uprising stands out with increasing clarity. The more one succeeds in grasping the interconnection of the events of the four days in June, the more is one astonished by the vast magnitude of the uprising, the heroic courage, the rapidly improvised organization and the unanimity of the insurgents.

The workers' plan of action, which Kersausie, a friend of Raspail and a former officer, is said to have drawn up, was as follows:

The insurgents, moving in four columns, advance concentrically towards the town hall.

The first column, whose base were the suburbs of Montmartre, La Chapelle and La Villette, advance southwards from the gates of Poissonniere, Rochechouart, St. Denis and La Villette, occupy the Boulevards and approach the town hall through the streets Montorgueil, St. Denis and St. Martin.

The second column, whose base were the faubourgs du Temple and St. Antoine, which are inhabited almost entirely by workers and protected by the St. Martin canal, advance towards the same centre through the streets du Temple and St. Antoine and along the quais of the northern bank of the Seine as well as through all other streets running in the same direction in this part of the city.

The third column based on the Faubourg St. Marceau move towards the Ile de la Cite through the Rue St. Victor and the quais of the southern bank of the Seine.

The fourth column, based on the Faubourg St. Jacques and the vicinity of the Medical School, move down the Rue Saint Jacques also to the Cite. There the two columns join, cross to the right bank of the Seine and envelop the town hall from the rear and flank.

Thus the plan, quite correctly, was based on the districts in which only workers lived. These districts form a semicircular belt, which surrounds the entire eastern half of Paris, widening out towards the east. First of all the eastern part of Paris was to be cleared of enemies, and then it was intended to move along both banks of the Seine towards the west and its centres, the Tuileries and the National Assembly.

These columns were to be supported by numerous flying squads which, operating independently alongside and between the columns, were to build barricades, occupy the smaller streets and be responsible for maintaining communication.

The operational bases were strongly fortified and skillfully transformed into formidable fortresses, e.g., the Clos St. Lazare, the Faubourg and Quartier St. Antoine and the Faubourg St. Jacques, in case it should become necessary to retreat.

If there was any flaw in this plan it was that in the beginning of the operations the western part of Paris was completely overlooked. There are several districts eminently suitable for armed action on both sides of the Rue St. Honore near the market halls and the Palais National, which have very narrow, winding streets tenanted mainly by workers. It was important to set up a fifth centre of the insurrection there, thus cutting off the town hall and at the same time holding up a considerable number of troops at this projecting strongpoint. The success of the uprising depended on the insurgents reaching the centre of Paris as quickly as possible and seizing the town hall. We cannot know what prevented Kersausic from organizing insurgent action in this part. But it is a fact that no uprising was ever successful which did not at the outset succeed in seizing the centre of Paris adjoining the Tuileries. Suffice to mention the uprising [The uprising took place in Paris on June 5-6, 1832. -- Ed.]"" which took place during General Lamarque's funeral when the insurgents got as far as the Rue Montorgueil and were then driven back.

The insurgents advanced in accordance with their plan. They immediately began to separate their territory, the Paris of the workers, from the Paris of the bourgeoisie, by two main fortifications -- the barricades at the Porte Saint Denis and those of the Cite. They were dislodged from the former, but were able to hold the latter. June 23, the first day, was merely a prelude. The plan of the insurgents already began to emerge clearly (and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung grasped it correctly at the outset, see No. 26, special supplement), especially after the first skirmishes between the advanced guards which took place in the morning. The Boulevard St. Martin, which crosses the line of operation of the first column, became the scene of fierce fighting, which, partly due to the nature of the terrain, ended with a victory for the forces of ""order"".

The approaches to the Cite were blocked on the right by a flying squad, which entrenched itself in the Rue de la Planche-Mibray; on the left by the third and fourth columns, which occupied and fortified the three southern bridges of the Cite. Here too a very fierce battle raged. The forces of ""order"" succeeded in taking the St. Michel bridge and advancing to the Rue St. Jacques. They felt sure that by the evening the revolt would be suppressed.

The plan of the forces of ""order"" stood out even more clearly than that of the insurgents. To begin with, their plan was merely to crush the insurrection with all available means. They announced their design to the insurgents with cannon-ball and grape-shot.

But the government believed it was dealing with an uncouth gang of common rioters acting without any plan. After clearing the main streets by the evening, the government declared that the revolt was quelled, and the stationing of troops in the conquered districts was arranged in an exceedingly negligent manner.

The insurgents made excellent use of this negligence by launching the great battle which followed the skirmishes of June 23. It is simply amazing how quickly the workers mastered the plan of campaign, how well-concerted their actions were and how skillfully they used the difficult terrain. This would be quite inexplicable if in the national workshops the workers had not already been to a certain extent organized on military lines and divided into companies, so that they only needed to apply their industrial Organization to their military enterprise in order to create a fully organized army.

On the morning of the 24th they had not only completely regained the ground they had lost, but even added new strips to it. True, the line of Boulevards up to the Boulevard du Temple remained in the hands of the troops, thus cutting off the first column from the centre, but on the other hand the second column pushed forward from the Quartier St. Antoine until it almost surrounded the town hall. It established its headquarters in the church of St. Gervais, within 300 paces of the town hall. It captured the St. Merri monastery and the adjoining streets and advanced far beyond the town hall so that together with the columns in the Cite it almost completely encircled the town hall. Only one way of approach, the quais of the right bank, remained open. In the south the Faubourg St. Jacques was completely reoccupied, communication with the Cite' was restored, reinforcements were sent there, and preparations were made for crossing to the right bank.

There was no time to be lost. The town hall, the revolutionary centre of Paris, was threatened and was bound to fall unless resolute measures were taken immediately.

I once knew a guy in college who since graduating has become quite the revolutionary, and he has forwarded me to some fascinating reads and articles when I repeatedly come around to hassle him with questions.

Perhaps it'd be an idea for one of you guys to do an AMA? If you haven't already. But until then, I have this thread, you don't all have to answer every question here, if you don't want to, pick another question and please try answer that for a more focused single responses if you think that'll be more efficient, just let me know which question you're answering.

(I have searched, my questions have not yet been answered, and I aim to get a general consensus on the modern r/communism population.)

Anyway, let's get on with it;

- Firstly, would you guys agree that you think it'd be better for the larger powers of the world to embrace some form of Communism? E.g. The United Kingdom, The United States and the Russian Federation, as well as states within the European Union. And how would these states go about transitioning to this Communist state? Revolution or do you believe that some of these states have the potential to elect a Communist Party and bring about a peaceful transition to Communism?

- Secondly, of the Americans here, what are your opinions of your current government? Would you happily see transition and co-operation with a change of government, increased relations with China and a re-thinking of the constitution? How many of you believe that the US constitution is a good thing?

- It has to be asked; What are your opinions of North Korea? And of the whole Korean situation in general?

- If you are a Communist living in a bourgeois-led state, particularly those where the public view of the line between Socialism and Communism (and even Liberalism in extreme cases) has been significantly blurred; how do you go about your daily lives? Does your style of living reflect a certain difference compared to those of your neighbours on your street? How and where do you meet and discuss your views? And do you ever face discrimination from the more xenophobic lot?

- Do you think a return of the USSR in some way, or at least a majority to the CPRF would be beneficial for the Russian people? What further steps could be taken to achieving the needed goals of Communism?

- If you could summarise why you have chosen to follow the Communist way of thinking over all other ways of thinking in a brief-ish manner (or not-so-brief), what would you say?"	t5_2qolz	True

Every now and then I will get a pm of someone asking for help finding organisations and parties that they can join.  
With this recent thread about being a communist without partaking in any revolutionary praxis, and the comments within, an old idea came back to mind.  
I know a lot of communists get really anxious because they do not feel that they have a window to real world activity and they feel they are wasting their life and ideology just sitting on their ass as capitalism continues to ravage the world.  
So here is the idea: We have lots of users (I know a few), who are actually involved in party and organisation activity. Users, be ready to orientate communists in your area who are interested in joining up and partaking in communist activity. Disenfranchised communists, ask for help from your fellow communists to participate in parties and organisations!  
This is still the best chance to start trying to make a difference in the real world, to gain very useful experience and critical depth, to make your political ideology into something concrete and maybe deal better with your consciousness, the frustration of not actively fighting against capitalism.  
If this gets off well, I might make a monthly feature. Please, no turf wars, no denouncing organisations that get recommended, but other kind of critical input is appreciated.

While I certainly am very happy with the education, literacy, health care and such things there,  I cannot help but to notice the poor conditions of infrastructure,  very old items (car) and lack of some necessities at times. Which got me to thinking. At first I just kept saying to myself that it is still far ahead of most Latin American countries. However I then thought of how much better the situation could (hopefully) be if the embargo was lifted and how many negative things have been a result of it.

[Moscow Mayor says no to more mosques in the city](http://rt.com/politics/moscow-mayor-says-no-to-more-mosques-in-the-city-669/)

&gt; According to some estimates Moscow has 10 illegal migrants for every registered one. This makes the number of unregistered foreign workers in the city to well over two million. In 2012 the authorities deported 16,000 foreigners from the city for working illegally.

From [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19j68o/moscow_mayor_says_no_to_more_mosques_in_the_city/) in /r/worldnews:

&gt; They're mostly from former Soviet Republics in Central Asia. Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Tajiks. As far as I know they're allowed to enter the country legally, but not allowed to work. That's why their engagements are almost exclusively in the shadow market, their employers hide them away in underground bunkers and working conditions resemble slave labour. However, those guys are still comparatively happy about it as they can earn more there than in their home countries and send money to their families at home.

The nightmarish logic of free market capitalism in Russia:

&gt; Another thing to note. Factory owners routinely enslave these illegal migrants. They lock them inside big buildings and have them work on garments and instruments for years on end. Most of these migrants are comprised of poor Asian and Indian women / children who migrated there for a better world only to get locked up. The people who control these operations rarely get busted due to strong political ties. This is why Moscow allows illegal migration to go on; it's just like slavery with all the benefits and none of the losses. Google it and you will see heartbreaking videos.

1361450815.0	18y926	Against Karl Popper: China as the Neptune of Marxist science	firerobin88	30	9	9	"Karl Popper is frequently cited by anti-comminists as proof that Marxism is not a science, since under no circumstances could Marx's predictions ever be falsified. Although these same critics also claim Marx has been proven wrong. So Marxism is somehow both unfalsifiable and falsified at the same time.

And Popper also considered Darwinism to be unscientific, since survival of the fittest was a tautology, by definition if an unfit animal survived, it was declared fit, thus Darwin could never be wrong. 

Now Popper accepts the scientific veracity of the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory ""There are seven planets in the solar system"" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. 

So let us look at the supposed refutation of Marxism, by the revolution breaking out first in backwards Russia and not UK or Germany. First off, at the end of his life Marx was optimistic that the first revolution could be in Russia. Lenin's modification of Marxism to adjust to the new data, was to postulate, the Law of Uneven Development. Conforming to the new facts of world imperialism and finance capital, Lenin postulated that it was actually the backward undeveloped nations that had the most potential for revolution. The nations of the East. From the 1920s onward the nation hypothesized as most likely to experience Communist Revolution was China. This was a risky and not at all likely conjecture. China at the time was considered the most backward, feudal, medieval nation in the world. That masses of Oriental peasants who had seemingly lived unchanging since the dawn of time, could rise up following Marxism-Leninism, would seem a pipe dream. You can read over the debates between Stalin and Trotsky in the 1930s, despite the venomous disagreements, all currents of Marxism shared the prediction that the next revolution would be in China. The weakest link in the capitalist chain. And in 1949, the second Communist revolution did indeed take power in China. The Neptune of Marxist science.

On a related sidenote. George Soros the supposed Commie billionaire behind Obama, is a huge follower of the Hayekian anti-communist Popper. So some numbskull Teabaggers actually go so far as to call Popper, Soros' red Mentor-

Before I read Peter Camejo's [autobiography](http://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Memoir-Peter-Camejo/dp/1931859922) I tended to view the debate on Leninism to be regulated to, say, Social Democrats, Left-Communists, or Anarchists vs. Marxist-Leninists. The odd thing, to me, about the current debate is it seems to be coming from people who view Lenin and the Russian Revolution in a more or less positive light. I more or less put my views on the topic [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/17w6ov/burying_lenin/). Today's there's another article on the same topic: http://www.thenorthstar.info/?p=5683 this time blaming vanguardism for failures in the history of the American labor movement. The one thing that amuses me more than anything else is how the people posting at this northstar website(And specifically Louis Proyect) seem to think they are bringing something new to this debate. But if you read any book on the formation of Leninists parties outside of Russia who will see this debate has always come up. Not to mention it is similar to the debates which created the Bolshevik party. It's not new. Maybe I am not being open minded about this but it seems what they are offering isn't really a solution to the problems of the left. Eurocommunism pretty much killed the western communist parties as mass parties in the working class. What they want, or at least what I think they will end up with, is a socialist party which comes to the table as nothing more than a United Front in all but name being held back by constant and unnecessary internal fighting and probably fracturing if the party is able to grow even a tiny bit.

1359950762.0	17uiti	Thematic Discussion: Week of February 3rd, 2013: Voting and Democracy in Socialist Societies		32	9	13	"There have been a number of previous discussion related to voting on this forum, but they have almost all focused on voting in Liberal Democratic societies. I'd like to discuss democracy and voting in a socialist context, however. A few possible areas to discuss:

* Is national level democracy necessary in a socialist context? This is based on the argument that Cuba is a much more democratic state than most liberal democracies, despite the lack of a popularly elected central government, thanks to locally based democratic initiatives. 

* How can a vanguard party revolution transition to a more democratic structure?

* What would a voting structure look like in a socialist context? Would a simple 50%+1 be enough to elect a leader, or create a policy, or would a higher threshold be required?

* In a socialist society that engages in traditional ballot voting, should voting be compulsory?

* What should be voted on in a socialist society? Who gets to vote, and on what issues?

* Can voting and democracy undermine a socialist project? Is there ultimately any role for democracy, of any form, under socialism, or is authoritarianism still ultimately necessary to continue to advance the socialist project.

And feel free to discuss anything else related to voting and democracy under socialism. I was largely inspired in this question by the film [*Beyond Elections*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkajOPgkhw), which I'd recommend to all. It is not specifically about voting in a socialist context, but it presents forms of democratic decision making that go far beyond liberal democratic notions of the concept, and can be a source of inspiration for the discussion at hand."	t5_2qolz	True

1355663524.0	14xv4o	Rosa Luxemburg's critique of Bernstein (revisionism): Reform or Revolution? (chapter one)	JasonMacker	37	15	1	"A little backstory...

Prior to World War One, there was a split in the [SPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany) between those who saw reforms as a means to an end, and those who saw reforms as an end in itself.

On one side was Eduard Bernstein, the founder of revisionism. He argued that socialists should not seek revolution, that capitalism has been tamed and with the rise of trade unions, the working class will gradually gain class consciousness simply by arguing for better wages, working conditions, etc. As far as he was concerned, there was no tipping point. Things will just keep getting better and better for workers, indefinitely:

""The final aim of socialism, whatever it may be, means nothing to me; it is the movement itself which is everything.""

That is what he said.

And looking back at history, we have a very easy time seeing how this is obviously **NOT** true. We know from a historical perspective that those who choose between principles &amp; goals, and opportunism &amp; ""the movement"" itself, have become failures or ghosts of their former selves. Every single time.

Why does this happen?

The answer is that the Big Picture is lost. When you zoom in on a small skirmish, there is a lost of sight of the entire battle, and even the whole war.

When the big picture, the actual significance and meaning is lost, then it turns into dogma and superstition. People just do thinks simply because they see the people before them do it. Why fight for higher wages? ""because I want to make more money"". Why make more money? ""Because I wanna be rich!"" Why do you want to be rich? ""Because [consumerism]"". This line of thinking is *exactly* what happens when there is no preservation of principles: ""Us workers need higher wages because it allows us to use the capital earned to erase false consciousness and cause even more workers to demand higher wages, until we reach the point where either the working class has more collective capital than the bourgeoisie, or until they refuse to raise wages any higher, at which case revolution is necessary."" That broader perspective is lost when the simple-minded mantra of ""must only care about raising my wages"" is pumped and promoted without any context.

We see this not just on the class (proletarian vs bourgeoisie) front, but also on other fronts (third world, gender, race, etc.) as well. 

Rosa Luxemburg addresses this in the very first paragraph of her pamphlet *[Reform or Revolution](http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/intro.htm)* (1900):

&gt;&gt;At first view the title of this work may be found surprising. Can the Social-Democracy be against reforms? Can we contrapose the social revolution, the transformation of the existing order, our final goal, to social reforms? Certainly not. The daily struggle for reforms, for the amelioration of the condition of the workers within the framework of the existing social order, and for democratic institutions, offers to the Social-Democracy an indissoluble tie. The struggle for reforms is its means; the social revolution, its aim.

And it's with this theme that Rosa Luxemburg writes the rest of this pamphlet: While reform is important, but don't forget that *the whole point of reforms is to pave the way for revolution*.

In Chapter One she talks about opportunism and how Bernstein is rejecting scientific socialism:

&gt;&gt;The scientific basis of socialism rests, as is well known, on three principal results of capitalist development. First, on the growing anarchy of capitalist economy, leading inevitably to its ruin. Second, on the progressive socialisation of the process of production, which creates the germs of the future social order. And third, on the increased organisation and consciousness of the proletarian class, which constitutes the active factor in the coming revolution.

&gt;&gt;Bernstein pulls away from the first of the three fundamental supports of scientific socialism. He says that capitalist development does not lead to a general economic collapse.

&gt;&gt;He does not merely reject a certain form of the collapse. He rejects the very possibility of collapse. He says textually: “One could claim that by collapse of the present society is meant something else than a general commercial crisis, worse than all others, that is a complete collapse of the capitalist system brought about as a result of its own contradictions.” And to this he replies: “With the growing development of society a complete and almost general collapse of the present system of production becomes more and more improbable, because capitalist development increases on the one hand the capacity of adaptation and, on the other – that is at the same time, the differentiation of industry.” (Neue Zeit, 1897-98, vol.18, pg.555)

We know today, undoubtedly that capitalist development **does** in fact lead to economic collapse, such as the Great Depression, or the most recent economic crises. But it doesn't take a dedicated intellectual to simply review major events in history. Luxemburg's argument for the inevitability of economic collapse was *before* any of the events of the 20th century took place. How did she know in advance? The answer is that she knew because of using historical materialist analysis, as Marx and Engels argued and did themselves.

Revisionism is self-refuting and is ultimately not *socialist*, as Luxemburg explains:

&gt;&gt;Revisionist theory thus places itself in a dilemma. Either the socialist transformation is, as was admitted up to now, the consequence of the internal contradictions of capitalism, and with the growth of capitalism will develop its inner contradictions, resulting inevitably, at some point, in its collapse, (in that case the “means of adaptation” are ineffective and the theory of collapse is correct); or the “means of adaptation” will really stop the collapse of the capitalist system and thereby enable capitalism to maintain itself by suppressing its own contradictions. In that case socialism ceases to be an historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society.

Again, we know today that capitalism does NOT suppress its own contradictions. In fact, capitalism only exacerbates its contradictions. The unhinged market really does gravitate towards slavery/imperialism.

And that's why you can look at all the ""Leftist"" parties and see that they've drifted all the way entirely from class struggle. Bernstein himself would probably be flabbergasted by all the neo-liberal and Third-Wayist and other such bullshit that **self-proclaimed ""Labor"" parties and ""Social democrat"" parties** of modern times promote! If he was brought back to life today I wouldn't be surprised if the first thing that comes to his mind is an apology to Luxemburg and an admission of being incorrect. Or maybe I'm being too generous of him?

Share your thoughts on that or on any part of this in general. Thanks.

So today the people of Greece went to the polls and a bare plurality voted to empower a group of bourgeois fucks that literally want to sell the nation to Chinese corporations in order to pay off German bankers for loans they took out to finance stupid Greek businessmens' decisions from five years ago. Unfortunately for the Greek people and the German bankers the Chinese corporations have no interest in buying Greece at the price they have been offered.

The competition to the option of ""selling the country to Chinese rich people to pay off German rich people who lent too much money to Greek rich people"" was the mislabeled ""coalition of the radical left,"" a grouping of greens, eurocommunists, and a salting of so called Maoists and Communists. The NYT called it occupy + Ralph Nader which I gotta say really sounds about right. While it's leader claims that Hugo Chavez is his hero, I've rarely seen a slimy pol run right faster than this clown did. SYRIZA basically offered the Greek people the option of paying off the German rich people but at a better rate and without selling the country to Chinese rich people. Alas, the Greek people didn't believe them, probably because the Greek masses are smart enought to know how badly they are fucked. When the left offers a shit sandwich with sugar on top the masses are likely going to say ""no thanks, the shit sandwich without sugar seems more nutritious"". 

Of course there is an actual honest to god communist party in Greece, but it's old and encrusted with all sorts of historical barnacles, and not enough people feel they can trust them either. And then there are the fascists, who function as a threat. And then there are the Anarchists, who have no solutions, but who have the saving grace of throwing a fuckin burning molotov at all the right people.

Elections don't work in situations like this. Period. The only answer is organizing outside of and against the system that was able to transform SYRIZA from a marginally anti-Euro party into Pasok in a few weeks. Here in the US we just had a famous recall election in WI. The target of that recall, an anti-worker dickface, was running scared when ""the left"" (as disorganized and shitty as it is) was organized in solidarity against his union busting. But as soon as the terrain of the fight moved to the Dem. party and elections everything came to pieces and he kicked the lefts' ass. 

The lesson to be learned is that elections are the enemy's turf. Don't participate. Don't play that game. And make sure you cast a skeptical eye on *anyone* on the left who does at this historical moment.

Therefore, it is pointless to talk about past theorists such as Lenin, because once the new revolution arrives, all past theories will become meaningless in the face of this new situation.

This is generally an ultra-leftist sentiment, though I've seen some Marxist-Leninists subscribe to the belief as well. Coupled with this is the belief that theories such as Leninism and Maoism are archaic, that they were only ever relevant to their historical periods, and they're now useless in the face of modern capitalism.

How do comrades feel about this? I personally find it to be a ridiculous fantasy. Systems such as Leninism, Maoism, and even Left Communism are not simply ideologies that we need to believe in hard enough to win, they're revolutionary strategies for defeating capitalism and then establishing socialism. To throw them out the window while awaiting some far-off revolution would be to commit intellectual suicide, to lose decades of experience, and it would pretty much condemn us to starting all over with our theories.

In addition, the belief that this magical revolution will take place and wipe away all our differences is linked to economic determinism. It is the belief that capitalism will automatically collapse sometime in the near future, that it is totally inevitable, and so we may as well not lift a finger until the time comes. These are the same people who condemned the Bolsheviks for taking action against Tsarism because it ""wasn't the right time."" Almost always the people advocating waiting until the situation ""becomes revolutionary enough"" have an incredibly subjective idea of what constitutes a revolutionary situation, or no idea at all.

These are my thoughts. What do you guys think? And if I've misrepresented my opponents' viewpoint, could someone here better enlighten us?

EDIT: While I'm on the subject, I've also noticed a trend among leftists to condemn any discussion of the USSR. ""Stalin is dead, stop talking about history and focus on how we can defeat capitalism now,"" is usually their cry. I believe these comrades are missing the point. It is highly important to analyze the history of the Soviet Union for two reasons:

1) The bourgeoisie will lie about it. They constantly use the USSR is an example of how socialism cannot work, and if we don't find the real reasons it did not work, we allow them this advantage of misinforming the masses.

2) It is relevant to the question of tactics. If it was Lenin's theories such as the vanguard party that resulted in the Soviet Union collapsing, then we must abandon the vanguard and look elsewhere. If it was a lack of democracy, as some comrades claim, then Lenin's theories are fine for rallying the proletariat, but we must be sure to have democracy once we're victorious. Many more arguments are abound, but to sum up my point, your stance on what went wrong with the USSR will directly parallel your political stance."	t5_2qolz	True

Okay, I'm in my final year of high school, and for Modern History, we have been studying pre-1942 Soviet Union and the revolution. As we have progressed through the course, my already fairly left-of-centre views have progressed and now resemble Communism.As of this moment, I think my views closer resemble Trotsky or Lenin than Stalin, who, to put it bluntly, seemed like a bit of a prick. 

I am aware that most of you guys probably have a greater understanding of Communism in the USSR than I do, so basically my question is this: In the hypothetical situation that Lenin continued to lead the Bolsheviks, or Trotsky seized power instead of Stalin, would the USSR have been more ""successful"" per-say? Or is the Trotsky hypothetical simply over romanticized in the light of Stalin's errr ""forth comings""?

And if you guys think Stalin was a good leader/ better alternative to Trotsky, I'm completely open to that as well.

Thanks :D

Here it is:

It's part of the current five year plan. They draft the plan every five years but of course they also predict longer term trends. This has to do with even development, and it is the result of several processes which affect each other:

1 - increased productivity in agricultural production allows for a smaller rural population to create a bigger agricultural surplus to supply the cities

2 - the increased productivity in agricultural production is proportional to the direct investment made in agricultural industrialization

3 - more labor is needed do propel industrial production in the cities further, while the services sector also syphons a growing portion of qualified laborers into another sector of the economy

I can make a few conclusions based on those points:

1 - for better or worse, the peasantry is no longer the most advanced revolutionary sector of chinese society like it was in the age of Mao, and they will get smaller and smaller as rural productivity increases and petty agricultural production is replaced by giant state agribusiness enterprises

2 - industrial production seems to be the locus of social tensions in china at the moment and it tends to increase at least for another decade, so we should expect tensions to rise along with it

3 - the growing service sector also means the growth of a labor aristocracy within china, and with it we can expect a petit-bourgeois ideological outlook to be more influential within the nation

4 - as for a longer term trend, China will increase its policies of investing abroad and generate ever growing tensions with imperialist powers

What we can expect China to do in the next five year plans to come is to react both to the social tensions industrial production is generating and to the growing cost of industrial production due to the decreasing marginal rates of resource intensive production. So they will attempt to emphasize the financialization of the economy, the growth of the service sector, and desperately seek surplus extraction from other countries, as well as base resources for industrial production. The growth of the service sector and the financialization of the economy is capitalism's solution to the unbearable social tension created by the labor conditions of a country that underwent the process of industrialization, and also the response to the growing scarcity of resources.

It was written shortly after the crushing of the communist uprising in Germany in 1919, and mere hours before Luxemburg's own death. I've always found it a rather inspiring piece of writing, because it's a reminder that  individual defeats, far from dashing the hopes of the revolution, are in fact integral to it.

Her words had a profound effect on me the first time I read them, and still do. For us leftists of the 21st century, the long history of smashed uprisings, failed states, and subverted revolutions that lies behind us may burden our spirits with a weight even greater than that of the long, hard road that still lies ahead. Yet we must at all times remember, as Luxemburg did, that these momentary defeats have never, and will never represent the death of the socialist ideal. Rather, each localized engagement between revolution and reaction (whether it ends in victory or defeat) represents a preliminary expression of a still-developing revolutionary consciousness: a forerunner to the great revolutionary upheaval that, when the time is ripe, will consume the world. In beating down these premature expressions of consciousness, the ruling class may for a time succeed in obscuring the outward signs of the impending revolution, but they will never defeat the movement itself. 

Rosa Luxemburg, realizing this even in the moment of her greatest defeat, did not resign herself to despair. Instead, she looked ahead to the inevitable triumph of socialism. Her brief final statement ends with a defiant and powerful salvo at the German authorities:

&gt;“Order prevails in Berlin!” You foolish lackeys! Your “order” is built on sand. Tomorrow the revolution will “rise up again, clashing its weapons,” and to your horror it will proclaim with trumpets blazing:

Therefore, we must at all times study social conditions and make practical investigations. Those comrades who are inflexible, conservative, formalistic and groundlessly optimistic think that the present tactics of struggle are perfect, that the ""book of documents""[5] of the Party's Sixth National Congress guarantees lasting victory, and that one can always be victorious merely by adhering to the established methods. These ideas are absolutely wrong and have nothing in common with the idea that Communists should create favourable new situations through struggle; they represent a purely conservative line. Unless it is completely discarded, this line will cause great losses to the revolution and do harm to these comrades themselves. There are obviously some comrades in our Red Army who are content to leave things as they are, who do not seek to understand anything thoroughly and are groundlessly optimistic, and they spread the fallacy that ""this is proletarian"". They eat their fill and sit dozing in their offices all day long without ever moving a step and going out among the masses to investigate. Whenever they open their mouths, their platitudes make people sick. To awaken these comrades we must raise our voices and cry out to them:

1361834184.0	197zvd	Short thoughts on 'hateful' nature of some Western media	bowei006	25	7	19	"It seems now-adays that any mention of China, Cuba, N. Korea will almost ALWAYS go back into using key words such as 'state media', 'communist party of ___' and 'state officials'.

I find this completely repulsing. Is it incorrect? No. 

But what it is doing is the following example:

Jaws comes out and scares millions into being scared of sharks.
And then, for the next 3 decades, beaches have constant reminders of sharks on every plate everywhere with media always talking about staying away from Sharks and other facts about Sharks.

That is basically what I see. It isn't wrong, but the population of America is already heavily 'indoctrinated' and left in an orthodox thinking pattern of Communism=bad and state media=evil. Without ever really analyzing the info. 

Media will often add background info on some 'intersting things' in the article. But what I see less of is background info on the 'other side of things'. For example, how many western articles on n.korea that offer background info has ever mentioned Juche and rationalizations for why they are doing those actions? How many current articles mention background info on how espionage is something done in the past by the CIA as one of the largest perpitrators and that it is something nations do?

It is just something I am getting sick of. Background info that uses words that are known to get people riled up and is also part of a 'enemy-ally' system that was used heavily in ___ nation years ago. 

I wish to read articles on China where over half of them don't feel the need to mention that the article was from 'state media' or what the actions of 'state officials' are to the issue and how it is run under the 'Communist party of China'.

Do I see articles that mention the U.K go into background history on how their Queen is granted the power to rule by the power of God and how their officials in Africa that are sent as represenatives(theoretically) of the Queen are thus workers of God?

See how that idea above makes you go ಠ_ರೃ as in it doesn't make any sense? Yeah. That's how I feel. Useless hateful info that just incites comments about jobs for America, how Chinese people living in America hate the CCP(Wut? Some guy that came to America out of 1.3 Billion says he hates them and thus is the opinion of everyone?).

These are questions that I also struggled with as an Anarchist - not so much the wisdom of boycotting the bourgeois state as a tactic, but the details of how this can happen when people rely on the state to keep body and soul together. Boycotting elections is easy. Boycotting food stamps is not.  I expect that many possible revolutionary subjects rely on the state for all sorts of things: tuition assistance, food assistance, housing credits, direct wages, indirect wages, even policing and disaster assistance.

1356014906.0	15633y	Communism of the Day: Jhapa Revolt in Nepal	mza66	30	10	0	"The Jhapa Revolt was the first attempt at People's War in Nepal in 1971-72. This event had been ridiculed by rightists who only dwell on shortcomings as adventurist due to having been influenced too much by Charu Mazumdar's ""annihilation of class enemies"" line. 

This event was later considered one of the cornerstones in the Nepali Communist Movement by the CPN(Maoist) for having broken with decades long revisionism and actually launching armed struggle.

&gt;  In 1967, the famous Naxalbari upsurge began in a village by that name in the upper part of the Indian state of West Bengal, not too far from Darjeeling. The village of Naxalbari is only a few kilometres from the border of eastern Nepal. It is not surprising, then, that the influence of this movement would quickly spread into the adjoining areas of Nepal itself. In 1971, in the Jhapa district of eastern Nepal, a local section of the NCP split off and began a Naxalbari-type armed struggle. Although the movement had great historical significance, it could not develop into a people's war. The leadership of the NCP denounced the movement as ""ultra-left"", despite its importance. Under the blows of the enemy, the movement was defeated and its political leaders degenerated, later rejoining the main revisionist party.

A World To Win, [*Nepal: Hoisting the Red Flag to the Roof of the World*](http://www.bannedthought.net/International/RIM/AWTW/1996-22/nepal_hoisting_22_eng.htm) (1996)

&gt; The armed struggle of 1972-73 in Jhapa, in line with the protracted people̓s war waged in rebellion against the right revisionism prevalent in the communist movement, is the most noteworthy struggle. That rebellion certainly represents the revolutionary trend and spirit. Those who have been martyred in the process of consciously establishing a new democratic republic are immortal martyrs. Although there were deep shortcomings in the leadership in terms of petit-bourgeois mechanistic and “leftist” adventurist tendencies, it was however an important far-reaching rebellion against the autocratic feudal rule of the king and against the rightist reformist tendencies that had become deeply entrenched in the Nepalese communist movement. In the armed struggle to pursue the new democratic revolution the martyrs of the Jhapa rebellion will remain in the forefront.

CPN(Maoist), [*Strategy and Tactics of Armed Struggle in Nepal*](http://www.bannedthought.net/International/RIM/AWTW/1998-23/nepStrategyTactics_23Eng.htm) (1995)

&gt;  After the 1960 Royal (Rana) Coup, when the whole of the masses came out in revolt, the party came out with clear-cut revisionist slogans calling for a constituent assembly under the king, reinstallation of the dissolved parliament and participation in elections, etc. The Great Debate, led by the CPC and the GPCR had enormous impact on the communist movement in Nepal. As the youth supported the CPC and Mao’s Thought, the old revisionist leadership, pushed their reactionary ideas using the cloak of Mao Thought. While they managed to confuse some cadres, other revolutionary youth of Jhapa, influenced by the Naxalbari movement led by Com. Charu Mazumdar, declared armed struggle based on the line of ""annihilation of class enemies"". But due to ideological immaturity of the leadership of the Jhapa revolt, it gradually took a right opportunist line and drifted into revisionism after the set back in Naxalbari.

1349429632.0	10zhv0	Comrades, what do you see in the future of Marxism-Leninism?		28	12	14	"Before I start, let me say I'm aware that this board welcomes all leftist tendencies, but based on what I've seen it is predominately Marxist-Leninist (Mostly the Maoist flavor). However, I'm definitely open to input from any tendency so long as it's constructive.

The biggest criticism of Marxism-Leninism from other tendencies is that the political philosophy is simply irrelevant now. So I'm wondering what appeals to you all about Marxism-Leninism, what keeps you here? And what do you see happening in the future for us?

For a lot of people it seems that Marxism-Leninism is synonymous with Soviet hegemony. So many arguments aren't about the political philosophy itself, it's about the Soviet Union's actions, its foreign and domestic policies, its economy, the personal lives of its leaders. But for me, and the reason I was drawn to it initially, Marxism-Leninism has always been the analytical methods of Marxism combined with the revolutionary strategies of Leninism, I simply see the early Soviet Union as the most correct application of these theories.

Furthermore, one of the things that keeps me with MLism is that it has the most experience. I feel like even if the Soviet Union was actually a bureaucratic mess, isn't it better to look at what actually happened and try to correct our mistakes than saying, ""Well, too bad Trotsky wasn't in charge, now let's just pretend that Stalin incident never happened and go back to real Marxism.""

However, I'm slightly less optimistic about the future. Marxism-Leninism seems to be under fire from all sides. Not only do the bourgeoisie try to use Stalin-era USSR as irrefutable proof that communism can never work, even our own comrades in the radical left attack us. Of course self-criticism must always be used but many of these criticisms are just flat-out insults with no theoretical content. This could be ignored but the people who hate Marxism-Leninism are so numerous that part of me wonders if we're not just going to become buried under a sea of verbal abuse.

Another reason I'm drawn to Marxism-Leninism is, to put it bluntly, because most of its current theorists seem so damn smart. I mean, we have sites like MLM Mayhem, Espresso Stalinist, the APL blogs, and more. These people have their differences but most of what they say is usually dead-on. I want to be on their side when the revolution comes.

But it would be un-Marxist to blame everything on anonymous insults without trying to analyze WHY people resent Marxism-Leninism. I mean, the relations of production must correspond to the mode of production, so does that mean that if people are moving away from MLism, that it really is outdated? Are we truly stuck in the 20th century? Are we just going to be sitting on the internet waging these historical arguments, or are we ever going to connect theory with practice? Can Marxism-Leninism be revitalized, or has capitalism changed so much that we're just going to continue to be pushed to the side?

Or has Revleft skewered my vision? I'm still hearing about organizations like the American Party of Labor, the Revolutionary Students Union (They have no specific tendency but their spokesman is a Stalinist), third-world MLM movements...if we're losing on the internet is it possible that we're winning in real life?

Maybe I'm rambling too much, but I'm just interested in hearing from some other comrades. Until now I've shrugged off the accusation of being outdated as a quick insult from ultra-leftists, but I want to hear what other comrades have to say."	t5_2qolz	True

1344173915.0	xppdl	Banned Thought will answers all your questions about Maoism...		22	5	15	"[Banned Thought](http://bannedthought.net/) is an archive which posts lots of material from MLM organizations. Banned Thought can always be found in ""Resources"" in the sidebar of /r/communism.

There have been a bunch of questions here asking for the official stance of Maoists on this and that, and it's very likely that you can find your answers somewhere on Banned Thought. As such, comrades who want to know more MLM can do independent research.

Banned Thought is very theoretical, and as such the MLM newswire [Signalfire](http://signalfire.org/) complements it very well. And yes I am aware that I just recently spammed news from SF and that this has been a reoccurring trend.

On Banned Thought particular attention should be paid to the A World to Win section, since:

&gt; A World to Win was the unofficial journal of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM), the embryonic center of communist parties based on Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. The most notable achievements of this movement was the acceleration of the unification process of Indian Maoists and the People's War in Peru and Nepal.

&gt; Until 1993, the RIM adhered to ""Mao Tse-tung Thought"", but due to pressure from groups which upheld ""Maoism"", such as the PCP in Peru, it adopted Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Some parties, notably CPN(Masal) from Nepal, struggled against this line, which revealed some deep-seated differences. International organizations which adhere to ""Mao Tse-tung Thought"" can be found in ICMLPO and ICOR.

And, as such, it correctly represents MLM as theorized and put into practice by PCP and RIM.

Maoism in practice has been of this trend, and can be seen in people's war and maoist-inspired resistance around the globe (with notable exception of the Philippines.)

To sum up, paying close attention to these websites would raise the quality of discussion on /r/communism, and bring more understanding and less explaining.

1339965686.0	v6wff	Echoes of the Cultural Revolution in Lenin	ksan	22	2	10	"Reading Lenin's 1918 ['The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government'](http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/x03.htm) I was somewhat surprised from what it seems to me a clear echo of Mao's insight about the need for a constant revolution within the Communist Party and socialist society to clear out all bourgeois and capitalist tendencies. Of course this is not exactly a secret, but the clarity of Lenin's words in some cases still seems interesting. Some excerpts:

&gt; Every thinking and honest worker and poor peasant, however, will agree with us, will admit, that we cannot immediately rid ourselves of the evil legacy of capitalism, and that we can liberate the Soviet Republic from the duty of paying an annual “tribute” of fifty million or one hundred million rubles (a tribute for our own-backwardness in organising country-wide accounting and control from below ) only by organising ourselves, by tightening up discipline in our own ranks, by purging our ranks of all those who are “preserving the legacy of capitalism”, who “follow the traditions of capitalism”, i.e., of idlers, parasites and embezzlers of statefunds (now all the land, all the factories and all the railways are the “state funds” of the Soviet Republic).

(...)

&gt; The corrupting influence of high salaries—both upon the Soviet authorities (especially since the revolution occurred so rapidly that it was impossible to prevent a certain number of adventurers and rogues from getting into positions of authority, and they, together with a number of inept or dishonest commissars, would not be averse to becoming “star” embezzlers of state funds) and upon the mass of the workers—is indisputable.

(...)

&gt; Another condition for raising the productivity of labour is, firstly, the raising of the educational and cultural level of the mass of the population. This is now taking place extremely rapidly, a fact which those who are blinded by bourgeois routine are unable to see; they are unable to understand what an urge towards enlightenment and initiative is now developing among the “lower ranks” of the people thanks to the Soviet form of organisation.

(...)

&gt; No profound and mighty popular movement has ever occurred in history without dirty scum rising to the top, without adventurers and rogues, boasters and ranters attaching themselves to the inexperienced innovators, without absurd muddle and fuss, without individual “leaders” trying to deal with twenty matters at once and not finishing any of them. Let the lap-dogs of bourgeois society, from Belorussov to Martov, squeal and yelp about every extra chip that is sent flying in cutting down the big, old wood. What else are lap-dogs for if not to yelp at the proletarian elephant? Let them yelp. We shall go our way and try as carefully and as patiently as possible to test and discover real organisers, people with sober and practical minds, people who combine loyally to socialism with ability without fuss (and in spite of muddle and fuss) to get a large number of people working together steadily and concertedly within the framework of Soviet organisation.

(...)

&gt; The “administrative” elements provide a host of saboteurs and bribe-takers; the best part of the proletarian elements fight for discipline; but among both elements there are, of course, many waverers and “weak” characters who are unable to withstand the “temptation” of profiteering, bribery, personal gain obtained by spoiling the whole apparatus, upon the proper working of which the victory over famine and unemployment depends.

(...)

&gt; The fight against the bureaucratic distortion of the Soviet form of organisation is assured by the firmness of the connection between the Soviets and the “people”, meaning by that the working and exploited people, and by the flexibility and elasticity of this connection. Even in the most democratic capitalist republics in the world, the poor never regard the bourgeois parliament as “their” institution. But the Soviets are “theirs” and not alien institutions to the mass of workers and peasants.

1328891479.0	pjici	About Our Moderating Policy		22	5	4	"Greetings r/communism subscribers and comrades. As new mods, we’ve done our best to put together policies and features for this subreddit designed to make it a simultaneously elucidating and entertaining place to discuss communist theory amongst fellow Marxists of all stripes. The tendency flair, the ongoing layout redesign, the weekly discussion themes, the IRC channel, and the “communism of the day” posts are being received with a great deal of positive response from you, and we’re very glad. There are more changes coming, including potential reading groups and the like, all intended to make this space something truly positive for the online communist community.

Towards that goal, we are also developing new guidelines and a moderating policy to keep the forum focused, friendly, and progressive. What are the main tasks of your moderators while carrying out this policy? First, to combat hostile sectarianism. Second, to combat reactionary and oppressive behavior. 

Too often, broad left forums descend into petty squabbling and infighting between this tendency and that, one party and another. Most of us earnestly committed to the struggle to build socialism are guilty of it at some point; I myself have regrettably fallen into such behavior many times. Sometimes constructive posts are ignored because of ideological differences irrelevant to the discussion at hand, sometimes conversations about differing opinions devolve into name calling and irresponsible labeling. We as mods will step in to let users know when we feel the conversation is no longer positive or helpful and we would encourage you to do the same when you see it. Comrades, we dream of a world where Maoists and council communists, Trotskyists and Stalinists, can hold hands and sing songs of love and class warfare! Join us.

Another unfortunate feature of internet discussion forums is the prevalence of bigoted speech. The use of patriarchal, transphobic, gay bashing, ableist, and white supremacist language is sometimes used with the full purpose of being hateful, but is, I feel, more often used innocently and with no intent to harm. Still, these elements, even when used without wrong intent, reinforce the worst aspects of the superstructure, and make places like r/communism threatening to those of us who are less privileged. Always we must remember to ask ourselves, when we speak of freedom, who is it for?  We are applying this knowledge here in a way designed to empower those who are oppressed, so that they can explore marxism and what it means for them freely. As such we will also be reminding people not to engage in such negative, reactionary behavior, and would once again ask all of you to do the same if you should see it on display. The broad masses must be united as one.

Repeated refusal to follow these guidelines, and continued flagrant violation of moderator suggestions along these lines will result in a ban. At the end of the day, most Marxists have little patience for bourgeois concepts like inalienable rights, and we are no different. An official warning or reminder from a mod, or a few words advising that one is not striving in the manner set forth in this preliminary guideline from another user, should be looked at as a chance to reflect on what you have done wrong, self criticize so as to show others the proper way forward, and learn from it. Doing so will make us and our community a better place!

There  are also incorrect ways to react: to become belligerent, or to feign acceptance of criticism with no intent on following through, or to feel shame. Belligerence and hostility just further entrench the original mistakes, dishonesty over the criticism means that you cannot be trusted, and feeling shame means that you’ve misunderstood the reasons these guidelines exist and why you’ve been spoken to. The first may result in a ban at once, the second may result in a ban if you continue to behave incorrectly in the future, and the third simply means that something unfortunate has happened. We all make mistakes; the mistakes of the past, properly handled, should never be held against a person in the future.

Thank you for reading my needlessly verbose self post. I hope that this subreddit’s positive changes will continue swiftly, and that r/communism reaches its full potential. We’re already an amazing community, and that’s all thanks to you! This Proletarian Service Announcement was brought to you by your friendly neighborhood moderators."	t5_2qolz	True

The current right-winged government is coming to an end, but the people haven't stopped protesting since it started (the government acts like nothing happens and just water-cannons us), and the popular rage is building very, very strongly.

**(Note: You can skip all of this, as I don't know why I gave so much historic context…**


Since the military coup of 1973 in which the extreme-wing leaded by Pinochet and M. Friedman destroyed –by the use of brutal force and incredibly harsh economic moves– the democratically elected socialist government of S. Allende, almost 40 years have passed. After the coup, that lasted 17 years, Pinochet called for elections: vote “yes” to keep him in power, vote “no” to make him step down. “No” won, and 20 years of democratically elected “leftist” governments governed Chile until 2010. These governments were called “Concertación”, it was the group of left and center parties that won the “No” elections. The problem is that this coalition of “leftists” only perpetuated the neoliberal system created by Pinochet and did nothing to change it. In fact the Concertación keep privatizing resources and state-controlled means of productions…

In 2010 the right won the elections, and it was infuriating, enraging and intolerable that those fascists were to come back in power after having openly supported the torture and killing during the fascist coup of '73 of thousands of communists, leftists and innocents that gave their lives for the socialist movement during Allende. In these three years we have had protest after protest, we just haven't stopped protesting. But nothing has changed and nobody is hearing.

Now, in the elections that will come next year, the people presenting are 1. a right-wing that currently works for the current government, 2. the previous president of Chile, a lady form the Concertación that calls her “left” but did nothing “leftist” (and the Communist Party of Chile is supporting her in a sort of leninist strategy); then some other people, and finally some guy that appears as a really interesting choice… his discourse is openly socialist and defiant of the current system, he is really close to the people and embodies most of the reforms that people is claiming. He makes his discourses in the streets and is currently supported by almost all the leftist students that is the majority of students). I and thousands of communist and socialist will support him.


So, straight to the point: I'm going to print hundreds of stickers and I and some marxist organizations will place them everywhere, from the streets, tot he buses, to the metro, etc. And we are going to do some supporting this last dude I mentioned, but some others will be openly marxist. **I need some ideas…**

I want to make a sticker about the opening paragraph of the *Manifesto:*
&gt;A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
I'm thinking of the government palace in the night with some sort of literal spectre over it, but it will be made of workers and protestors.


And also I like very much the closing paragraph of the *Manifesto:*
&gt; Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
How can I represent this graphically?

Also, any other idea will be welcome, being them quotes or not, being them openly marxist or not.


**TL;DR:** I'm making marxist stickers to support a socialist presidential candidate, and also marxist stickers per se. Any ideas?"	t5_2qolz	True

&gt;Bourgeois government recognises the ""independence"" and occupation of Kosovo

&gt;The New Communist Party of Yugoslavia harshly condemns the bourgeois government of Serbia for the shameful reaching of agreement in Brussels with the representatives of marionette and puppet regime in Pristina. 

&gt;In this way the bourgeois pro-imperialist regime in Belgrade has recognised the ""independence"" of Kosovo and Metohija, gave up a part of Serbia's territory and has formally capitulated to western imperialist occupiers of the southern Serbian province. Therefore the NCPY asks the government of Serbia and other state organs do reject the Brussels  agreement achieved under pressure of the imperialist dungeon of peoples - the European Union. The ""agreement"" reached in Brussels de facto represents a national betrayal and giving up the citizens of Serbia on Kosovo and Metohija to the mercy of western imperialists and Albanian separatists. NCPY estimates that the Government of Serbia has made this move so that Serbia may enter the imperialist dungeon of peoples - the EU whose only goal is to make the richer even richer and the poor even poorer.

&gt;The claims of the representatives of the pro-imperialist bourgeois regime in Belgrade that its propositions in the agreement will protect the interests of the Serbian and other non-albaniam peoples in Kosovo are meaningless and absurd. The creation of the so-called ""community of serbian municipalities"" will guarantee any freedoms and rights to the citizens living on this territory because it will be subordinated to the traitorous and puppet government in Pristina that follow unquestioningly all the orders from he western imperialist occupiers. The the Serbs in Kosovo will have the right to suggest names of the regional police commandants and in the north of the province the so-called Kosovar Army also is no guarantee for the Serbian people and other citizens who are completely at the mercy of the occupier and their servants.

&gt;NCPY declares the the current condition should be called by its real name, that Kosovo and Metohija are occupied by western imperialists and Albanian separatists. In Kosovo both the Serbs and Albanians are equally occupied by Washington and Brussels. With the moves it's making the bourgeois government of Serbia has de facto recognised the ""independence"" of Kosovo and Metohija and accepted the occupation of the souther Serbian province. The people of our country has never suffered occupiers. As they did not suffer the Turkish and Austro-Hungarian occupation, so they did not suffer the Nazi-Fascist occupation in WWII and so today they look with contempt at the occupation of the southern Serbian province.  As it has not accepted the imperialist breaking apart of our socialist homeland SFR Yugoslavia as well as the criminal aggression and tearing apart of the FR Yugoslavia, NCPY completely rejects the imperialist occupation of Kosovo and Metohija. The Albanian and Serbian people as well as all other peoples that live on this territory cannot be free as long as Kosovo is under the occupation of western imperialism and it's puppets in Pristina.  The Serbian and Albanian people should follow the shining example of the brotherhood and unity and revolt against the occupiers in the WWII provided by the Partizan heroes Boro and Ramiz. Only after the occupier troops of NATO leave the territory of Kosovo and Metohija can there be conditions for the free and happy life of all its citizens while remaining a part of Serbia. In the case that the bourgeois pro-imperialist Government of Serbia confirms the ""agreement"" from Brussels which stands in opposition to all the regulations of the Constitution that regime invokes, the NCPY holds that this will be a reason more for its immediate resignation.

&gt;Down with the anti-people Brussels agreement!

&gt;Stop the occupation of Kosovo and Metohija!

&gt;NATO get out of Serbia!

(Note: unofficial translation, I am not a member of or affiliated with NKPJ in any way. Apologies for the clunky translation as well, I am not a professional translator).
