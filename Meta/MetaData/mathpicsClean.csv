8000x8000, 25mb unscaled version available [here](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/190/0/c/algebraic_numbers_of_degree_2_by_fauxtographique-d6cndg2.png) for exquisite detail.

These are renders I did in my spare time. The script is written in Python, utilising Python Imaging Library.

The extent of the frame over the complex plane is roughly Â±1.2 Â±0.6i in the cropped and scaled version, and Â±1.2 Â±01.2i in the full size image. The real line runs horizontally through each image, and the points on the real line with small gaps on either side of them are integers, so the unit circle should be quite clear.

Edit: The red dots are the Algebraic numbers; all numbers that aren't transcendental, i.e. numbers that can be the solutions of polynomials with integer coefficients.
They're a tiny subset of the complex plane that apparently have this awesome inherent structure where all the points seem to line up beautifully on circles.

[This picture, very roughly, shows the blast as being ~590 pixels wide, on a slope, in a full frame of approx. 1253x892.](http://i.imgur.com/xXtOB95.jpg) (Nerdy! I know!) The tree, (the only standing figure that we can get a speculative height measurement on) is about 60% probability to be an [Aleppo Pine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_in_Syria) because it looks like one, I think.

[The Aleppo Pine grows to be at median height of 65.5 feet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_halepensis)


Here comes the super cool CIS-style deductive reasoning part:


If using the picture of the blast, we assume that the tree nearest to the blast is 65.5 feet high, and that the elevation height from the slope to the right outer edge of the blast is 5.5 trees high, then we can do a cool proportional ratio to determine the width of the blast radius in the number of trees long. (108 pixels/5.5trees = 590 pixels/x trees) = ~30 Trees or (30x65.5ft)= **~1965 feet wide blast crater length. To put that in perspective that's as wide as 5 1/2 football fields.** (assuming 120 yards, or 360 feet on a football field - counting the endzones)

[Since our M84 standard bomb produces an approximate 50 ft wide crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_84_bomb#Development_and_deployment), it's safe to say that what ever did the exploding in this video wasn't 1 Bomb, but many. The target most likely housed explosive ordinance."	t5_2sf1t	True

    order = 3;
    maxPlotPoints = 30000000;
    imageSize = 8000;
    imageOutputDir = ""/home/user/outputdir""

    depth[numPoints_, order_] := Floor[N[1/2 (-1 + (numPoints/order)^(1/(1 + order)))]]
    max = depth[maxPlotPoints, order];
    Print[""depth: "", max];
    Print[""number of equations to solve: "", (2 max + 1)^(order + 1)];
    Print[""number of points to calculate: "",order*(2 max+1)^(order+1)];
    subsets = Tuples[Table[j, {j, -max, max}], order + 1];
    Print[""solving equations...""]
    sols = Complement[Flatten[N[x/.Solve[Table[x^j, {j,0,order}].#==0, x]] &amp; /@ subsets], {x}];

    Print[""constructing graphics...""]
    points = Point[({Re[#], Im[#]} &amp; /@ sols)];
    g = Graphics[{AbsolutePointSize[2], Red, points}, PlotRange -&gt; {{-1.2, 1.2}, {-.6, .6}}, ImageSize-&gt;imageSize, Background -&gt; Black];
    fileName = ""algebraic_numbers_numPoints-"" &lt;&gt; ToString[maxPlotPoints] &lt;&gt; ""_order-"" &lt;&gt; ToString[order] &lt;&gt;""_image_size-"" &lt;&gt; ToString[imageSize] &lt;&gt; "".png""
    Print[""exporting graphics...""]
    SetDirectory[imageOutputDir];
    Export[fileName, g];
    Print[""done.""]

The first 2 lines are the main inputs.  ""order"" is polynomial order (other numbers will work!).  ""maxPlotPoints"" sets an upper bound on how many points will be generated.  The program uses it to determine the ""depth"", as described by DoctorLeary.  This is an extremely memory hungry program.  You'll need about 8 gigs of spare ram to run it with the parameters shown.  If anyone want to create a low memory version, that would be nice.
