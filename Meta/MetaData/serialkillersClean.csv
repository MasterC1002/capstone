Also, if you could distinguish if you like it because it's a really good *movie* or because it's really *accurate* (that is, it accurately portrays real life serial killers and how they operate), that would be great, because there's definitely a difference between the two and I might like a movie for either reason.

On the other hand, I've always been under the impression that serial killers themselves are fairly uninterested in the work of others.  If one is a musician or writer he studies the greats -- but perhaps that's because those two activities are a more creative impulse while wanting to kill or rape is much more carnal.

Or maybe I'm totally off and many serial killers were 'fans' of previous killers but it just was not documented -- although it seems like an interesting tidbit the media would drool over.

Quick Note: The seller did include a quick note stating authenticity that I am trying to locate, however it was something as a typed up document without chain of custody. 

**** Update. I found the COAs. These were purchased from Blackwells Gallery, Beacon NY. I am not quite sure if the store is still around because of the limit google responses.

Every single one of them was found laying face down on the beds with a shot to their backs.

1346974574.0	zh67c	Serial murder is a lot harder to get away with than it was just 20 years ago. I believe the number of serial killers is falling, and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. Only highly organized killers will be able to accumulate 10+ victims. Your thoughts?	ANAL_POWER_GENERATOR	42	10	19	"**1)** I imagine the act of murdering someone itself has become far more complex and risky.

 In the last few years we've seen the rise of 'stranger danger' culture. We're perpetually bombarded with human interest stories about pedophiles and rapists. People of my generation in general seem less trusting of strangers than my parents' generation did at my age. Women in particular are taught to maintain constanst vigilance to the threat of (sexual) attack.

Although I believe the police nowadays don't like to talk to the media about serial killers, the widespread notoriety of Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer et al means that people knows they exist now, and are less likely to put themselves in the positions of vulnerability serial killers have created for their victims in the past.

**2)** Furthermore, the rise of social networking sites and mobile phones has made luring someone back to your home and interacting with them a lot trickier. Even if they feel at ease, potential victims may well reveal their whereabouts to one or all of their friends while in a serial killer's domain. That means potential serial killers now have to follow their victims beyond the eye of onlookers and kill them quickly, or incapacitate them as soon as they become aware of the killer's presence. These two methods do not fit the MOs of lots of past serial killers and I believe many potential killers will feel the same.

**3)** I'm not an expert on law enforcement agencies, but, again thanks mainly due to the rise of technology, they have become a lot more cohesive and effective. Background checks, monitoring and the collection of forensic evidence have improved exponentially. For example, it is now possible for the police togather the thoughts of non tech-savvy suspects who have access to computers and the internet and base a conviction on those alone.

***TODAY'S serial killer must be intelligent. He must assimilate to society. He must have a clean record and background. He must kill his victims quickly and brutally and leave no trace of his crimes behind. In short, he must become the Hollywood stereotype of a serial killer in order to survive. Contrary to their popular image, many past serial killers are unintelligent and spontaneous murderers, and this type of serial killer has no chance in today's climate.***

1364636164.0	1bang9	More on Edmund Kemper	DarkHighways	35	5	5	"Firstly, if you are seriously curious about Kemper, the book you canNOT miss is ""Why--The Serial Killer In America."" Ignore the reviews. And it's in print again so the price is reasonable. The point is, Margaret Cheney was there. She interviewed Kemper and his sisters (I don't think anyone else EVER talked to them.) She did a ton of independent research, talked to all the police officers involved, talked to people from Santa Cruz who knew him, and on and on. She knows more about Kemper than anybody; she even got to read transcripts of parts of his nightmarish confession. Like so many who got to know Kemper well--practically everyone that I can think of anyway--she was horrified beyond measure by his deeds but could not help feeling sorry for and even liking him personally. In particular, she hints very clearly at the nature of his childhood traumas when she cannot legally be specific (when she got too close, Kemper blocked her and shut her out.)

Yes, her writing style is annoying and you have to put up with some of her lame philosophizing, but it's still one of the LEAST sensationalistic, most in-depth and most thoughtful books ever written about a serial murderer. The lack of sensationalism is what really appealed to me; she explores the real human being Kemper, not some mythical tabloid ""monster"".

Psychiatrist Donald Lunde's book ""Murder and Madness"" is great too; there's a lot of good material about Kemper and the other two Santa Cruz murderers infamous in that era, Mullin and the other guy whose name I always forget.

Also, this rather sad interview of a fortysomething, ill-looking Kemper from 1991, with Stephane Bourgoin: http://vimeo.com/53059340

Bourgoin's not a very good interviewer, but Kemper is interesting as always. Twenty years on, he's distanced from the killings, but the way he describes them is both poignant and exceptionally horrible, especially his strangely admiring, haunted reminiscences of Marianne Pesce. I've heard that this interview upset him so badly that it's the main reason why we've seen no interviews with him since then.

**The Riverman**: Carey Elwes as Ted Bundy being interviewed regarding the Green River Killer and his own crimes. Elwes performance was great. 

**Zodiac**: The first half of this movie is excellent, the second part I don't like so much because it focuses on Greysmith and contains the inaccuracies from his books regarding his 'suspect'.

1. I'd like to know what their favorite childhood memories are.  
I asked him this but he didn't answer.    

2. Are you going to blame your actions on your childhood?  
I reworded this so it was less aggressive. He said ""Yes I had a rough childhood but I didn't know it until I was older. But yes the poor and almost non-existant relationship I had with my father was part of whats wrong, also genetics I am bi polar or manic depressive and it is really hard to just live. I want to be normal so bad but I'm not. Now I'm glad I'm not because I see things differently than others.""        

3. Do you have any regrets about the crimes you've committed?  
He mentioned in a previous letter that he did not have regret about his other crimes but felt remorse for the murders because their families didn't deserve that. I modified this question and asked how the murders were different than previous crimes that he did not have remorse for. John: ""You asked about other crimes that I don't feel remorse for. I set fire to a field while playing with (illegible word) me and another kid. It was next to my school I was like 8 or 9 years old. Nothing got burned down just the weeds in the field. I also used to break into cars, and shoplift everywhere I went. I started drinking after highschool and would steal bottles of anything and party with my friends mostly girls. When I was 18 I was having sex with a girl who was 15. Technically thats a crime but I see it differently mentally men are a few year more imature where women/girls are a few years more mature.""    

4. I'd like to ask any and all serial killers about their mothers.  
He said: ""Yes, I still have contact with my family and I see my mom on occasion. I talk to her on the phone once a week.""    

5. What would be the defining point for you as a serial killer?  
""You asked if there was a defining moment. Not really. I had a breakdown of every thing in my life many losses and felt abandoned by everyone just real depressed and angry. THe year before my first victim I lost my dad, my fiance took my kids and started seeing the guy she was cheating on me with. I lost my job and I was close to being homeless again for the second time. I was a stressed out wreck.""  

6. Have you ever met another serial killer?  
John is friends with ""Charlie"" Manson. He wrote ""I mentioned friendships and yes nick and charlie are probly who I'm closest to. I think Charlie has some plan for me that he wants to see happen but he never just comes out and says things he hints at them or uses analogies.""    "	t5_2s9td	True

Yes, I think we are kinda weird for being interested in serial killers. I was always a big fan of crime shows, and our cable package has Investigation Discovery and CI now, so I've been watching even more real crime shows. It fascinates me a lot, and then I stumbled upon this subreddit. I think I like this place, but have to admit... I am kinda creeped out by some of the posts too. Which is a good sign I guess. 

So, I can't imagine ever hurting some one, or taking a life, life is such a beautiful thing and people are always loved and missed by some one. It is not anyones right to take them away. I don't feel any sympathy for serial killers and their crimes and I really can't stomach the more gruesome details of what they did. Yet the whole process of how they came to be and how they are caught fascinates me. Upon finding this subreddit and reading through all the links here I feel like delving into the subject a bit more. But I have this crazy worry that I'll eventually won't be put off by the gore anymore. And who knows if there's a sliding scale from there on? I mean - I don't believe you can become a serial killer from reading about it. But I was just wondering:

Has delving into this subject changed you in any way? Has it shifted the boundaries of what you accept as normal?

Interested in your stories of how your interest started and how you experience it on a more personal level.

I would never do so, of course, but I can't seem to help thinking of contrafactual getaway scenarios for crimes that I learn about.  It makes me examine my own motivations - after all, maybe everybody (including me) is a potential serial killer and a person just needs the right stimulus to act.  It's a disturbing thought.

So how about you?  Are you some kind of deliberate genius type of killer who's gathering information for his/her next crime?  Are you into law enforcement and figuring out ways of catching these monsters?  Are you into psychology and want to try and understand why people do what they do?  Perhaps you're a survivalist who wants to be aware of behavior that signals someone who could potentially be dangerous to you.  Please share! :)"	t5_2s9td	True

He is an intelligent, well-spoken, often times nice person in interviews and such, but was it all an act? When he said he would give his life to bring back those he killed? Was it a sham? The ramblings of a charismatic and manipulative serial killer? I don't think so, which leads me to my question.

I mean, if it was, how he stated ""compulsory"", how is that not insanity by some mean? If someone murdered 17 people, committed necrophilia and cannibalism compulsively, that's not ""I'M OUT TO GETCHA"". That's clearly an illness, which Dahmer even stated he wanted a psychologist to come and evaluate him to see why he wanted, scratch that NEEDED to kill. But he didn't get the chance.

When I was 11-13 I lived in Olathe, KS and had relatives in Wichita. I briefly did boy scouts with my older cousin in 2004, and Dennis Rader was a supervisor/leader for one of the tribes. He wasn't in our tribe but I remember he was always there when our whole troop had the gatherings. I was just a kid at the time but I remember that Dennis was always really nice to me. He was to everyone. I remember reading after the fact that he was a leading figure in one of the Wichita churches too. I talked to him a handful of times but I always saw him around and just figured he was one of the kids' dad. 

It's weird to think about that that guy was once BTK, one of America's most prolific serial killers. I left the troop before he was caught in 2005. I didn't really follow the news and my dad didn't share the BTK story with me until I was a little older and had moved out of state. It was so surreal when I saw his courtroom confessions on YouTube of his murders where he was essentially describing the play by play. This was a guy I had been in the same room with on countless occasions. At my parents' home, somewhere there is a group picture in which him and I are both in it! And not only that, he had admitted that he planned on killing again even though it had been a decade and a half since his last murder. 

I guess that's what sparked my fascination for serial killers. "	t5_2s9td	True

As far as I know, it's available for both all the apple devices and Android devices. There *is* a small fee, around $2 or so? But in my opinion, it's well worth it. There's a vast amount of profiles to read. Some are a bit short, others go into greater detail.

It has become one of my favorite apps, and I figured I should spread the word. :} Happy reading~

The Original Night Stalker/The East Area Rapist was never apprehended. The psychological profile says he likely;


&gt;Engaged in deviant paraphilic behavior and brutal sex in his personal life
Sexually functional and capable of ejaculation with consenting and non-consenting partners
Self-assured and confident in his abilities
Hated women for real or perceived wrongs
Would continue committing violent crimes until incapacitated by prison, death, or some other intervention 


[Beach Murder, Grim Play Portends Death By KEN DRAKE Evening Outlook Staff Writer 11/17/1972](http://www.findadeath.com/forum/showthread.php?23572-Kathleen-Ann-La-Chance) Kathleen Ann La Chance was attacked in Santa Monica in 1972 with a bootlace, violently beaten, mutilated and raped. *Police said she had been stabbed 12 times in the lower abdomen, upper left chest and back, and then disrobed, bound hand and foot with boot laces and sexually assaulted.*


In 2001 the Northern California rapes were linked by DNA to murders in Southern California.

I also remember a detail about him mutilating his own genetalia with pins and whatnot and that his victim count was a very large number. 

I think I might be putting Fish and Chikatilo together as the same person and imagining the documentary, but I swear it is some whole other individual.

1334823768.0	shk26	The Problematic Distinction Between a Serial Killer and a Legendary Soldier	priorprior	22	10	10	"About a week ago I was watching a documentary on military snipers on the history channel and there was an interview with [Carlos Hathcock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Hathcock) who was a sniper in Vietnam.  He had 93 confirmed kills during Vietnam which gives him the record for that particular war.

During the interview, he spoke with such certainty that what he had done was for the good of humanity and was very proud of his accomplishments.  I couldn't help comparing his interview with the interviews of serial killers and mass murderers who were also very proud of what they had done.  Carlos' record of 93 kills is 3 times higher than Gacy's victims and 5 times higher than Dahmer's.  

I think this alone is enough for me to make the argument that many soldiers have a drive to kill.  Maybe not a sexual drive like many serial killers, but maybe a compulsion towards the power and control that murder can give someone.  

And, honestly, I sort of find it to be an odd distinction between serial killer and soldier.  One is universally despised by most and one is celebrated and given medals for their service.  Having a hobby studying military history is a fairly common pastime, but if you tell someone you study serial killers you get the weirdest and most terrified looks ever.

So, what do you think of the difference between serial killer and soldier?  Do you think it's fair or problematic?  Do you think that there is a clear moral distinction between the two?

Think character traits reflecting the underbelly of modern societal values personified in a person.  Here's a few quotes from ""The Monster of Florence"" by D.Preston that are guiding my thinking:

“many countries have a serial killer who defines his culture by a process of negation, who exemplifies his era not by exalting its values, but by exposing its black underbelly”

“each killer was, in his own way, a dark embodiment of his time and place”

Good reference movies that have killers who personify a specific time include Natural Born Killers, Bonnie and Clyde, Badlands, M, Manhunter.

Nature takes care of itself. Predators thin herds which keep the prey healthy. They is almost always a balance, and even when the scale is tipped one way, it's not long before it corrects itself. This is simply because of cause and effect. If wolves increase in number and therefore kill a large amount of elk, greatly lowering the population, soon there will be less food, so less pups will be born. With fewer wolves, the elk population will increase. Look at Yellowstone. Predators such as wolves impacted the forest itself, the rivers, everything. It's when Man steps on that things go to hell. 
We have consumed the planet. We are overpopulated, people are homeless and starving. Things are happening in our civilizations that simple do not occur in nature. We have no natural predators. There is nothing to control population or territories, because we have advanced to the top of the food chain. It's obvious that we are our own downfall, but what if nature was stepping in to correct the imbalance? There are no predators of Man in nature, so maybe some are evolving to fill that vacuum. A lion stalking in the grass, a falcon flying silent over head. A perfectly equipped predator to sneak among us and prey off the weak (and by this I mean the vulnerable, as many victims are). 
We have advanced in technology and medicine, so the plagues of the past which culled a giant amount of the population have less effect on us now. A sickness rushing through the population will and have been devastating at first, but we have people who immediately rush to find a cure, a way to combat it, saving millions. 
There's no shot that protects us from those who make it their life's work to spill our blood.

i will translate some of the main things he talks about, but he tends to speak in long winding sentences and some things he says seem unstructured and sudden. 
i added some explanations in []'s for the stuff he says that is implied in russian but gets lost in translation. judging by his intonations and by the way he misdirected his answers, chikatilo seems very sorry only for himself and considers himself wronged by life and the russian justice system.
russian is my third language, but i'm pretty fluent in it and am really into chikatilo, so i thought i'd share here. also, i was surprised just by how oblivious he is to his own guilt given the often quoted ""i am a monster"" bs and ""preserve my brain"" crap he gave the reporters. 

**LET'S GET TO IT**:
he talks about how his mother told him that his brother was cannibalized &amp; that his mother told him to be careful of cannibals. he is **asked if he loved god when he was a child (or ever) and c. says he doesn't know because his childhood was about surviving more than anything else** (ie not about religion or family relationships). he remembers crying because he was hungry and only having a morsel of old bread to eat.
the interviewer asks chikatilo if he feels sorry for the little red riding hood or if he ever had (when he heard the tale in his youth). he says ""yes of course, when i was a kid and heard the tale i cried and of course felt sad about it.."" he seems reluctant to talk about it and then the interviewer pushes him and asks if he felt sad for the wolf then? c. answers ""well somehow i didn't really assign it any significance (ie the wolf's death in the tale)""
**interviewer asks if he ever thought of what will happen if/when he meets his victims in the afterlife, chikatilo says ""no. i never thought about that. i think that all of that has nothing to do with me** and i don't think about it. i have gone through so much suffering in my life that no i do not think about this and if i was to write about all my sufferings it would be like writing about hell, so i have suffered so much that i have already come to peace with anything bad that may happen to me and i don't think about it "" he also says ""the judges, doctors and **society have been asking me why i did not hang myself [ie hang himself instead of going on a killing rampage]** and all these doctors who have written about the stress i must have been under to commit the crimes and such, and i can answer them that **if i was a more standard person, then i would have drank myself to death or hanged myself, but i have gone through my life being despised and having people pull the rug from under my feet** - everywhere (ie at work and at home) [so he is saying that he could bear the building pressure of needing to murder and stress *after* the murder caused by having to hide it from everyone only because he was ""not standard"" and was used to ""living in hell"" at work and elsewhere. so basically he is implying that if people in his life had not been so horrible to him, then he would not be already used to ""living in hell"" and he would of killed himself or drank himself to death instead of indulging his desires to kill and being able to tolerate the pressures of being a serial killer ---- he is not to blame..it's society's fault for developing his stress-resistance :)..]"" 

int.: are you tortured by nightmares?
chi.: **my psycho-sexual or sexual-psychiatric thoughts and perversions are piling up in my head.** they studied me, with electrodes on my head and everything, they have fixed proof of my illness... and all that stuff that the **doctors say and my lawyer has proved that i am sick and that i should not be shot, that i can be shot only if i am healthy, but o.k. never mind that, let's just say that my nightmares usually torture me when i have severe headaches because of the concussion i suffered after they [the police] took me in and also from when i was working as manager in the mines and tried to take away the vodka from the mine workers and they tried to poison me for that** (he got a concussion on that occasion as well). i do exercises in my cell, sometimes my heart feels like it is pounding so fast that it will explode and then i think - so be it, all this will end sooner, and i do this when my head aches, in an effort to distract myself from this.""
he talks about how he knew some big shots in the communist party etc and that he was really a somebody, that he traveled and such but most of it is very fragmented and unclear. he talks as if he thinks that the interviewer knows what he is talking about.

I'm an avid reader and I was wondering if you guys have any books to recommend to me about serial killers. I can't get enough of this stuff(its morbid, I know,  but quite fascinating to me)

The last month I read:

The Riverman by Bob Keppel, which chronicles his interviews with Ted Bundy while they try to catch the Green River Killer.  It was okay, but the only thing that bugged me was that Bundy skirted around and bullshitted the whole time(suprise suprise) until the very end, where you get to read his confessions(which, are also on youtube.)

Defending Gary - Amazing book written by one of the defense attorneys for Gary Ridgway, I highly recommend it.

Chasing the Devil - Written by Sheriff Reichert, who was the head of the Green River Killer investigation.  Highly recommended.

And of course, I've read just about everything by John Douglas and Ann Rule's book on Bundy, ""Stranger Beside Me."" And of course, also, the Hannibal Lector series.  Give me some fresh meat!!!! :)"	t5_2s9td	True

A transcript would be okay to, but I'd much rather listen to it.

Anything like: ''This serial killer is still in the streets, we recommend you to lock your doors...''  or something like this.

Thanks.

I haven't read them in a while so I'm going to go back and check them out to see if I see anything that might help.

Heres some patterns I've noticed about the victims(note: i haven't followed this case that much, so this is just surface things i've noticed.)
All white females
All petite
In vulnerable situations(prostitutes)
All strangled
Most found in burlap sacks on the beach(does this guy work in the fishing industry perhaps?)

So, most likely, he's definitely got to be a white male. No doubt in my mind. SKs usually choose their own race, and(if i'm not mistaken) all victims are white.  The fact that they are petite also is interesting to me.  I'm assuming(i know i know, assume makes an ass out of you and me) he got pictures of them before meeting them since craigs list and all -- a SKs paradise, unfortunately.  So he probably narrowed them down to fit his 'type.' So he might be a smaller guy himself if he purposely chose petite women.

Any one else?

Edit: One more thing.  I think they're using the media to draw him out to communicate with them.  I read an article posted a few days ago that was talking about a phone call he made to a victims sister in 09 IIRC.  "	t5_2s9td	True

To start: Bundy murdered women.  All young, attractive and fitting a certain appearence pattern (which many believe matches that of his ex girlfriend, who seriously impacted his already disturbed life).  He would assault/murder them, kidnap/transport the body, rape them, dispose of them, and simply move on with every day life.  He did this between 35-90 times.  The large gap is only due to the fact that he never told anybody the real number.  

In at least one instance, he took two girls to one spot, raped and killed one of them infront of the other, then performed the deed on the unfortunate witness.  Once apprehended, he escaped from prison twice.  On the second escape, he murdered three more girls.  The final of which being twelve years old.

This entire time, he was living as a clean cut law student in a lengthy and (seemingly) healthy relationship.  Many saw him with a future in politics, especially when he worked in the party of a republican candidate.  Was Ted Bundy the most evil man to exist in the 20th century?  I think so."	t5_2s9td	True

I would really like to have some kind of compendium detailing the lives and crimes of serial killers, but I don't know where to start. Anyone have any recommendations for anything that might be of interest? I'm particularly fascinated by things like Albert Fish's letters, the Zodiac correspondence etc.

1302983436.0	grmkj	Recommended reading material?	tiger_lily	1	0	4	"Hey guys.  So I've seen a few comments about wanting some good books on serial killers/their pathology, so I decided I'd start a thread..

I highly recommend anything by John Douglas, specifically his book ""Man Hunter."" John Douglas was one of the premier guys at the FBI who started the behavioral science unit, and also writes like a great crime novelist.  His books are very easy to understand but at the same time teach you very valuable information about serial killers and how investigators solve crimes.

Another good book is ""Those Who Fight Monsters"" by Robert Ressler.  He is also FBI and actually taught John Douglas what he knows.  In this book he interviews different killers, including(but not limited to) Ed Kemper, Manson(yeah yeah Manson didn't kill anyone whatever), Berkowitz(his whole schtik about a dog telling him to murder people? Bullshit.) and Bundy.  He has an interesting story in the beginning when Kemper scared the shit out of him. Basically, he'd gotten close enough to Kemper to have a great rapport with him, but in turn let his own guard down(a big no no).. so he interviewed him alone, with just a button to press to alert guards to come get him.  The interview went great and at the end he pressed the button..  no one came.  He kept pressing for something like 15 minutes, no one came.  Kemper, being the manipulative smart ass he is, picked up on his nervousness and decided to fuck with him.  Basically told him ""i'd have time to kill you and leave your head on the table to greet the guards"" Ressler bullshitted his way through this, talking about martial arts to bide time lol, and finally the guards came.  Before he left, Kemper said, ""You know I was just fucking around with you right?"" At that point, Ressler decided never to allow an agent to interview alone, always with pairs.

Fiction wise, I definitely recommend ""Silence of The Lambs"" to be read by anyone remotely interested in serial killing.  While it is fiction, its such good fiction and reality based that you come away feeling like you read a real case.  Also, Hannibal Lector is a badass and while his actions are rephrensible, he's awesome.

He is still under investigation for the murder of 172 children in more then 59 towns in Colombia.
Now if you're wondering why the title of this post is called ''Colombia need to change there law restrictions seriously'' well I'll explain that now, because of the amount of children he raped and murdered, yes he raped the children after luring them in with gifts and money. The total amount of murdered children adds up too 1,853 years and 9 days but Colombian law however states that no person can be locked up for more then 30 days. Even a sicko who murders innocent children after raping them, his sentence has been decreased to 22 years in prison because of the fact he had helped the authorities find the bodies of the these poor victims.
He was sent to prison on the 22nd April 1999, so then that means that in 2021 he'll be back on the streets and I bet he hasn't given up his ways.

1317956401.0	l3qjp	Serial story (part two)	Crucks	1	1	0	"Within seconds of seeing his hunter Dons world was spinning, blurring, as his legs gave out, he saw a syringe in the mans gloved left hand.  without realizing time had passed he found himself sat in a chair, or rather handcuffed to one of his own kitchen chairs.  his vision was slightly blurred, he could  he felt like he had just been in a fight, alert, powerful.  “Don’t scream.” A cool voice said from behind him.  “The screaming got old a long time ago. You have not been poisoned, although that is the last thing you should be worried about.”  Don tried to break free from his bonds and strained to see the man, failing to do both.  “What your feeling is the adrenalin i used to wake you up. as to why you were asleep, that was a benzophimine based compound.  don't worry, i have a prescription.”  As he finished his last sentence he stepped into view. his black suit was custom fitted, his hair was dark and at a medium length parted off to one side.  the lack of contrast between him and the graphite colored walls around him was slightly mystifying in a disturbing way.  

“Whats going on?  Who are you?”  Dons shakily stammered.

“ah, they always ask the same questions, i used to love the begging.  now its just dull.”  a look of disappointment fell upon his face, but his terrible eyes never left Don.

“Please, take anything you want.   just... please.”  Don could barely comprehend what was happening, the adrenalin made it impossible to think clearly or focus on anything.  his whole body trembled from fear and stress.  his palms were wet with sweat.

“oh trust me, Donny i will.  but first,you need to calm yourself, because i am about to enlighten you.”  the same sneer that Don had seen before twisted the mans lips and narrowed his eyes. that evil, all knowing smile would haunt him until his death.  Most would describe the smile as evil, as well as the man, but whether something is truly evil or not is based on morals, which vary from person to person. if you were to ask any great villain, such as Adolph Hitler or Osama Bin Laden, they would not think they were evil.  that is where this man differed from his villainous peers.

“enlighten?  Wh- Who are you?”  Dons head was clear enough to be ashamed at his voice breaking.

“Ah!  this is something i just recently thought up.  i want you to name me.  call me whatever you like.”  a queer look of excitement and glee went through his whole body.

“you, what?”

“name me.”

“why?”  Don what utterly confused.  what did this man want from him.

“psychological experiment.  do it now, i would highly recommend listening to me.  for your sake.”  the man was starting to seem less entertained by Don, his once grace full movements and demeanor was becoming agitated.

this part i just spell checked and posted so its noticeably less... smooth,and flowing.  ill edit later.  any feed back would be much appreciated.

1317934869.0	l3eoa	Short story that belongs here (part one)	Crucks	1	1	3	" This story begins in a suburb near Sacramento California.  It was a beautiful June day, birds sang songs, children played, a Prius hummed by houses on Elk Grove road.  The house that we care about, however, is at the end of Dorcey street. A brick red, single story home, two bed, one bath, with a sound proofed basement with an assortment of electric instruments and amplifiers.  A man and a woman lived there, Carol and Don Peer, a young couple.  The Peers’ were newly wed, and Carol had just become pregnant.
  
Don sat at the kitchen table eating an Italian sausage omelet while Carol got dressed.  As he ate he looked back on his relationship with his wife.  They had met in high school but never talked to each other until a reunion 5 years post graduation.  They danced together most of the night, and the rest of it they spent in Dons bed.  What could have been a one night stand blossomed, over 4 years, into a beautiful marriage.  He couldn't help but smile himself when he remembered her smile that first morning.  the way her curly brown hair was tousled and frizzed, her beautiful blue eyes crinkling as she smiled.  The thought of his child that would be coming in 8 months brought that feeling into his stomach identical to the one he felt when he asked Carol to marry him.  That feeling of excitement, nervous fear, and that electricity in his belly.
  
Carol roused Don from his day dream, telling him he was going to be late for work.  Don stood and turned and kissed her.  “i love you.”  he said, with a wistfulness in his voice that was uncharacteristic of him.  She replied the the same, pleasantly surprised at his sentimental tone.  as he stepped out of his climate controlled home and into the sunlight that was immediately hot on the back of his neck, he knew it would be a sweaty day.  Don hated sweating, it made him nervous, which made him sweat.  his stocky, muscular build didn’t help ether.  he hurried to his car where the air conditioning waited.
  
Dons drive to work was uneventful, as was most of his day, save for the fact that he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched.  he even thought he saw some one following him out of the corner of his eye several times but every time he looked, nothing was there.  as he sat  in his cubicle, typing at his computer, his phone went off in his pocket.  a text from ‘Wife’ read, ‘gona be home late,  obstetrician appointment.’  Don, who's earlier loving mood had been replaced with frustration because of his computer, was more than happy to have some time to his self.
  
When Don arrived home he immediately flopped onto the couch.  with his face buried in the cushions he thought about his career.  being an accountant wasn't the most emotionally rewarding job for Don, in fact he would describe it as ‘soul crushing’, but it paid for his home, and he didn't plan on doing it forever.  You see Don was an aspiring musician.  he played the guitar primarily but he owned many instruments, and enjoyed playing many genres.  most of his Friends were musical as well and would come over to play.
  
thinking about his occupation wasn't making Dons mood any better so he decided to go make some music.  as he descended the stairs to the basement, which he sound proofed himself, a sharp pain shot through the left side of his neck, he spun around to see a lean man with a sneering smile and piercing green eyes.  the man wore a black fitted suit without a tie, his gaunt face was clean shaven, but it was his eyes that made Don Peer freeze.  They were the most magnificently beautiful eyes he had ever seen, the green was the color of pine needles with flecks so dark they were almost black.   however that was not the mans awe striking feature ether.  it was the way he looked at Don, like he was the mans dinner.  He was a predator.  

CRITIQUE AWAY!!  I have the second part written if you want to read the rest.

Starts with Jeffrey Dahmer. His story is incredibly tragic and he's the one I feel the most sympathetic for. 
Second is John Wayne Gacy. His upbringing fucking sucked. From another gay males point of view, I know the pain of being stuck in the closet. Also, he was so incredibly manipulative and major liar. 
Finally it would be Aileen Wournos. Her life was just fucked from the get go. Forced to perform incest, prostituting herself at such a young age, and obviously something's awry up in her head.
