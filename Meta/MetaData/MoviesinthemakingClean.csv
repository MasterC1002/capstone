&gt;This seems to be shot pretty well (Good cameras and lighting). Could anyone explain to me why it still does not look like a ""real"" movie? What did the makers of this do differently from a hollywood crew?

The answers I got:

&gt;""It's the best you get without heavy post-processing.""

&gt;""A lot of post processing comes into play. The people who edit larger movies spend a lot of time editing color and stuff to give it that cinematic look.""

Could anyone provide me with a link to a clip about footage that goes from ""zero"" to ""hollywood""? I'm really interested in this.

Everyone knows Robocop is getting a reboot and the majority of the filming was done in Toronto. Last week however, they were in Vancouver doing filming at ""Omnicorp Headquarters"" which is the Vancouver Convention Centre, located directly across from where I work.

They finished filming on the 14th and left after collecting all their signs and equipment... well, almost all of it. I was outside my building and spotted [THIS](http://imgur.com/AdTYhx2) today still up across the street. It was about 5 pm when I spotted it, and it took a few minutes to realize this was a piece of the set they had left behind accidentally. Not a big important piece mind you, but still kinda cool.

Rather than let it sit up there, be taken down by city workers, and tossed in the trash, I decided to climb the sign and save it. [I think it looks much better up on my wall](http://imgur.com/08sYBYx). "	t5_2uiff	True

Mithrandirs_Staff	7	3	0	"I found an article on Zentropa's website stating that [Nymphomaniac should be released later this year](http://www.zentropa.dk/news/opret_nyhed/?newsid=132). The article was written in Danish, so here is a rough translation of it.

&gt;Lars von Trier's upcoming film Nymphomaniac expected f√¶diggjort and ready for release before the end of the year, it said Zentropa's sales company TrustNordisk in a statement.

&gt;The project was originally conceived as a feature film, but the plan was later changed to two separate films. The more than 100 hours of footage recorded over 11 weeks last fall is of such high quality that director Peter Aalb√¶k Jensen according to DR now opens the door for it to end with an even bigger project: 

&gt;""Right now we have enough material for either three films or maybe two movies and a TV series. But whatever it is, we do not know yet "" , said Peter Aalb√¶k Jensen dr.dk / culture.

&gt;Nymphomaniac about the 50-year-old self-diagnosed nymphomaniac Joe, who looks back on a life of an unstoppable sex drive. The film has been shrouded in enormous interest since it was published, and according to Peter Aalb√¶k Jensen with good reason: 

&gt;""The film will probably be Lars von Trier's masterpiece. It has a huge potential in terms of humor and great visual quality, and show Lars von Trier at his best. Lars currently has. cut a quarter of the material, and it gets a merchant me smile when I see how light and laughter go hand in hand in a drama like this. This is Lars' to date most ambitious film. ""

&gt;The film, Lars von Trier's most star-studded cast to date with big international names such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan Skarsgard, Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Jamie Bell, Christian Slater, Uma Thurman, Willem Dafoe, Connie Nielsen, Mia Goth, Udo Kier and Jean-Marc Barr. By Danish actors perform such Jesper Christensen, Jens Albinus, Nicolas Bro and Melville.

He hopes to film the movie using actual film (you know, the stuff they used back in the old day), but film cameras have a significant cost.  In an effort to raise the funds, he and his crew filmed an entry into a commercial contest for a car dealership where the grand prize is a new car, which they hope to win and then sell in order to purchase a film camera.  With two days of voting left, they're neck and neck with an idiot that filmed a screaming puppet and considered it art.  Please help!  Take a moment and visit http://www.tommycarauto.com/2012-commercial-contest.htm and vote for the Jake Hulseberg entry.

Actually I see both of them as equivalent in stature to Alien and Aliens and they will be recognised as such in years to come.

Skyline: I'm really looking forward to how the story with these brainstealing aliens evolve. How the Aliens with technology to recover from an atomic blast continue to fight against the humans. Do we lose Earth and become a species on the run? How the 2 lead protagonists (boyfriend and girlfriend who is now pregnant) build on their story given they seem doomed, with the boyfriend's brain already sucked out.

Battle LA: I am very keen to learn how humanity fights back against these Aliens with superior tech which just uses water to power itself. What are the strange vulnerabilities of the Alien technology given they seem a bit clunky. Will the aliens just harvest Earth of water and move on? And how will soldiers think and fight in such tough conditions, especially given the strong esprit de corps of many military units of the world.

New distribution models (Theatrical AND simultaneous VOD), eager buyers new and old, and the massive success of ‚ÄúBeasts of the Southern Wild‚Äù and ‚ÄúArbitrage‚Äù combine to bolster the optimism of many, Mike says. 

""Arbitrage"" did the ""multiplatform release"" strategy and it's paid off huge for the small film. Mike quotes its backers saying it'll gross $50 million worldwide on a film that cost a quarter of that to make. But as Richard Gere's character in ""Arbitrage"" might say, always remember to get a piece of the gross. 

Read Mike's Sundance preview here: http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/mike-fleming-on-2013-sundance-forecast-small-deals-galore-and-greater-chances-for-filmmakers-to-have-their-work-viewed/

1374690646.0	1iz0co	New Ang Lee Project Announced	moviemakermag	1	2	0	"Focus Features announced today that Ang Lee is officially attached as Director of the Ken Jeong/Jerry Seinfeld Chinese railroad motion capture historical epic, THE UNCANNY VALLEY. 

Jeong will depart from type to play the Spartacus-esque, proto-union leader Zhang Bhao-Zhi opposite Seinfeld, who leaves retirement to star as the railroad baron, Leland Stanford. Daniel Day Lewis was reportedly considered for the part of Leland, but scheduling conflicts derailed the discussion.

James Schamus, CEO of Focus Features, described the film as a cross between THERE WILL BE BLOOD and THE POLAR EXPRESS, saying that fresh off his triumphant helming of the CGI-heavy THE LIFE OF PI, ""I'm very excited to see what Ang can do with this ever-advancing technology to tell the largely untold story of the people responsible for  America's westward expansion.""

THE UNCANNY VALLEY is slated to begin production in Spring 2014, with an anticipated awards season release in late 2014.

Currently, I'm running a campaign to get funding for a short I'm producing called ""El Burrito King"". As such, we are looking for money from the inter-webs, and to appease said inter-webs, I have secured permission from my director to rename a minor character to WHATEVER the internet decides (if we reach our goal of $3,000 by March 31st). To help reach that goal, I will be on reddit (and a few other sites) as often as I can doing whatever I can to get that bling.

 So. if guys are feeling generous, and want to help us accomplish our dream, please goto this site and donate: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/el-burrito-king/x/2551311"	t5_2uiff	True
