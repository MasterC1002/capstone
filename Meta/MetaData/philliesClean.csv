1335651603.0	sxcpq	A belated thank you	OvarianCamper	64	4	10	"I just thought of doing this after participating in a ""Why does everyone hate the Yankees?"" forum.  I remembered a recent visit to Yankees stadium in my Rangers gear and the death threats I received (I'm still alive, so I assume it was nonsense).  This happened in 2011 and 2010 (although in fairness to them it was the ALCS). 

But last year I visited Philly when the Rangers were in town and I had heard so many horror stories that part of me didn't want to wear my Rangers gear. Especially since my son was with me.  But he refused to go to the game without his Michael Young jersey on so we sported them both; and wouldn't you know I ended up having a really nice conversation with the group of people behind us about baseball (""Were you expecting us to stab you?"") on the first night, and the second night I had a similar experience.

So...the point of the post is a belated thank you for showing my son and I a good time last year and proving that Philly fans aren't as ...graphic... as rumors had led me to believe. 

edit: also the stadium is gorgeous.  And when we walked in someone asked if it was my son's first game, when I said yes they gave him an autographed ""first game"" certificate by Charlie Manuel and a philly phanatic key chain.  Your zoo is a treat, as well. "	t5_2qjl8	True

* [Whatever in the hell you call this](http://mlb.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pMLB2-8654148dt.jpg)
* A FUCKING J.A. HAPP SHIRSEY!! HE HASN'T BEEN WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR YEARS!! HE'S NOT EVEN STILL ON THE TEAM TO WHICH THE PHILLIES TRADED HIM!!!

**Things that are *not* available:**

* A simple Domonic Brown shirsey. Personally, I would much prefer one in [the very dapper coastal blue option](http://imgur.com/k32eAhJ), but at this point I would be happy with basic red.
* Not that I would buy one just yet, but let's say I wanted a Ben Revere shirsey. The Phils sent a (formerly) solid major league starter, and a solid pitching prospect out of town to get him, and they don't see fit to make available some damned t-shirts?
* For that matter, very little is available, generally.

As Krusty the Clown said, t-shirt sales are generally regarded as ""the sweetest plum."" It's not like they don't make an assload of these shirts for sale both at the club house store, and in a limited capacity at other retailers. Why is it that keeping the Phillies' official webstore both up to date and reasonably well-stocked is apparently tantamount to splitting the atom?

So 2 weeks ago I took a trip to Philly with my brother. After grabbing a roast pork sandwich from the reading market we headed out to citizens bank park. The game was the first of the day night white sox double header. Immediately, as we pulled up, I could tell I would like this park, although I did expect it to be bigger. Here are some pluses right off the bat: food can be brought in, drinks (even unsealed), can be brought in, and along with the cheap parking and tickets, this makes for a great day at the ballpark. First thing I did was take a 360 walk around the stadium (I prefer stadiums that let you do this and still see the game, fuck Yankee stadium) scoped out other food choices, smoking sections, and bathrooms. Now I've been to plenty of other ballparks besides the home of the Mets. Those include Orioles, Dodgers, Yankees, Marlins(new and Old), Blue Jays, Angels, and Nationals, but as of today Citizens Bank is my favorite. It's cozy, good views from almost anywhere, fan friendly (although the fans may not be friendly) cool to look at, and affordable.
Now, on to the actual game. 
 To remind you I am a Mets fan, so I know all About seeing a core of players get old and rusty, and hearing the rumors that some of my favorites growing up could potentially be traded. However some of the young players looked pretty promising. Pettibone proved he could be a solid back of the rotation guy, and Darin Ruf really caught my eye both offensively and defensively. He hit a solo blast to dead center to tie the game, and made an impressive sliding catch in foul territory shortly after. He looks like he could be a nice piece moving foward. 
As for the fans, it's good to see a ball park still showing excitement throughout the game. I chatted it up with a couple and no one seemed to jump me for being a mets fan like I  like I had anticipated. In fact the guy sitting next to me summed it up perfectly, ""we both hate the Braves more."" The 9th inning rolled around, and I got to boo Paplebon like I had hoped. I'm sorry, just don't like the guy. He worked a relatively clean inning to keep it tied, until the rain came around and sent the extra innings into rain deny. At that point, being Mets fans who have seen too many depressing and traumatic extra innings games, we called it quits.
I enjoyed the game, and your ballpark. Come out to Citi Field some time soon, but prepare to dump your wallet in the process."	t5_2qjl8	True

I cover the Phillies for 97.3 ESPN Radio and Philly.com Sports and wanted to see if there was any interest in me hosting an AMA thread in here sometime in the near future.

After the team's current road-trip, I'm leaving my post on the beat at ESPN so I can spend more time focusing on my freelance work and that means that I don't have to be so tight-lipped about the behind the scenes stuff I encounter on a day-to-day basis anymore. While I don't want to burn any bridges, I figure I have plenty of interesting answers to questions about the team, the broadcasters, and the other behind the scenes stuff that the fans don't ever get to see.

For some additional background, I used to contribute to The Fightins (RIP) and currently contribute to Zoo With Roy. I also just launched my own semi-independent Philly sports blog called [The Complex](http://www.complexphilly.com).

As an O's fan, it's nice to see a park completely packed like Camden Yars was up until a few years ago.  Philly is a town that really knows and loves it's baseball.

The group of friends I went with wore a hodgepodge of team gear.  The Orioles, Cubs, Astros, and Mariners were all represented.  Many of the fans asked if we were on a ballpark tour.

After he settled down in the first, he made one mistake in the 8th and let carpenter sneak a single up the middle, then chooch tried to go to second on that bunt play and next thing you know Roy is in a jam with runners on second and third and he hardly had a thing to do with it. So he loads the bases, and took about 20 pitches when his arm was smoked to strike out Lance Berkman, and eventually pop up Matt Holiday..

That shot of him walking into the clubhouse, he looked exhausted. He never looks exhausted. He gave everything he had to hold the cards at bay tonight. Unfortunately our offense couldnt hold up its end of the bargain.

Chris Carpenter made us look terrible tonight, his curveball was disgusting, and was locating his fastball. Roys stuff was nowhere near as good as Carp's, and he had kept us in the game against a muuch more potent lineup."	t5_2qjl8	True

Opening day tickets sold out in record time, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume the usual, that you people will be the majority of the crowd.

 People want upwards of 30 dollars for a standing room only seat on stubhub (For normal series you can just trade a pack of newports for baseline seats to a scalper)

Your fans are mean. It's one thing to come to Pittsburgh and enjoy a baseball game, its another to mock us. We know we suck, just don't rub it in, its like that highschool football player who picks on the kid with down's syndrome. I wouldn't even care if you guys started a ""Let's go Phillies chant"" that would be fine, whatever. Last season you people started a FUCK THE BUCS chant, a Pirates Sucks chant, and in general just mocked us the whole time. 

You are probably going to beat us.

So basically, thanks for ruining the season early for us. Nothing like feeling pathetic about your team from Day 1.

1366298705.0	1clz3v	My thoughts on the current state of the Phillies--I'm new to reddit but I wanted to see if you guys agree with my thoughts on the current state of our team.	DeeezNutleys	29	6	55	"The Phillies' 2008 World Series team was built slowly and methodically. We drafted talented and young prospects, gave them time to develop in our farm system and brought them into the majors when they were ready (Utley, Howard, Hamels, Burrell, Rollins, Madson, Ruiz, Happ). In addition, we acquired a number of proven veterans for reasonable salaries (Werth, Victorino, Moyer, Lidge, Meyers, etc). In every sport this kind of philosophy centered around the evaluation and development of young talent, prudent and disciplined spending, a positive and patient attitude--has proven time and time again to foster long term stability and success.

So between now and then, WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED??? $125 million to Ryan Howard even though he can't beat the infield shift and couldn't hit an offspeed pitch if it was on a tee in front of him. Over $300 million for three starting pitchers (yes, Hamels, Lee and Halladay are great but it's unwise to commit so much money to three players who aren't getting younger), $50 million for a closing pitcher--one of the most volatile positions in all of baseball. A complete neglect of outfielders and stop gap after stop gap at third base, a critical position.

What's the lesson here? Go back to the fundamentals! As a lifelong fan I would much rather take our lumps, endure a few losing seasons while we rebuild with new young talent then continue with this ridiculous 'win now' mentality that's responsible for putting us in the muck in which we currently sit.

1322494492.0	ms2a4	Book: 100 Things Phillies Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die	Crashburn_Alley	27	3	23	"Hey guys, I am Bill Baer, the creator of the blog Crashburn Alley (http://crashburnalley.com/). For those of you not familiar, it's a statistically-focused blog about the Phillies partnered with ESPN as part of the Sweet Spot network.

Between March and October, I worked on ""100 Things Phillies Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die"", chronicling the 100 most important events and people linked with Phillies baseball. Despite the heavy academic feel of the blog, this book is fun and relevant to all baseball fan demographics. From the 2008 and 1980 championships to Harry Kalas to Ed Delahanty, the most memorable parts of Phillies history are contained in the 256 pages of the book.

If you're interested, you can pre-order the book for $10.87 (27% off) on Amazon (http://amzn.com/1600786782), with an expected release date of March 1, 2012.

I apologize for the shameless self-promotion, but I think it's something most if not all of you will enjoy. If you'd like to keep up with me, I'm frequently on Twitter (https://twitter.com/CrashburnAlley). During the off-season, I'll mostly be snarking about stuff, but during the season, I live-tweet games and provide interesting statistical nuggets. Also, there may be promotions for the book, so Twitter or the blog is the best way to keep up with that.

Thanks for your time! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. &lt;3"	t5_2qjl8	True

Why?  Because that team needed to be deflated a bit.  Their win streak stopped cold, and maybe, a bit of mortality reintroduced into the lives of their fans, who celebrate as if the Dodger's have already won the World Series.

Anyways, for what it's worth, congrats and thanks.  The ESPN circle jerk around the Dodgers is sickening, and while this may be only a dent in their ego, at least I know it came from the NL East.

Enjoy the rest of your season, and better luck (but not too much) in '14!"	t5_2qjl8	True

A come-from-behind 9th inning rally completed with a walk-off single (not to mention a solid outing by Doc), a 14 hit and 9 run drubbing in support of a 7 IP 11 K effort by Lee, and a Doc-esque 6 IP 6 K performance by Oswalt as the power of our lineup finally came through with 5 XBHs. While Halladay, Lee, and Oswalt pitched well, this was by no means their best efforts. The offense showed a rarely before seen ability to get on base, capitalize on each of the Astros' pitchers mistakes, and (shockingly) not strikeout. Myers had a great outing on Friday (although it's ludicrous to claim that he ""out-pitched"" Halladay, look at the peripherals), and I was nervous that the offense was falling back into it's old habits (ex: not working the count...Myers threw nearly as many balls as strikes). However, that 9th inning was quite a sight. Lyon didn't have his best stuff. That being said, the lineup showed a surprising ability to merely take what was being given to them. They were aggressive, but not overly so. Single after single, run after run. I would like to see Chooch get going, but honestly I can't complain about anything after this series. Even Baez was serviceable.

1339408793.0	uvy45	The Phillies, Long Term	chaqalaqalaqa	27	6	66	"A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies trading for Kevin Youkilis to help solidify the offense and, to a lesser extent, the first base defense until Ryan Howard/Chase Utley returned. Seeing as how Youkilis has not done well in his return to Boston, I think that ship has sailed, and maybe for the better. The Phillies are aging, and have few high-level prospects ready to make an impact. First off, let's look at key issues moving forward:

* The free agency of Cole Hamels and Shane Victorino
* No clear successor for third base
* A largely unmovable payroll nearing luxury tax threshold
* Aging players at 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, C, and in the rotation
* Farm system depletion
* Organizational ignorance of advanced statistics

If Cole Hamels leaves in free agency for LA or NY, or another city, then the Phillies will have lost a very good pitcher and gained only some draft pick compensation (which isn't terrible, but is any draft pick worth a tier 1 pitcher?). The same can be said for Shane Victorino, although center-fielders are a bit easier to come by than a very good starter. My first thought is that the Phillies need to do anything they can to keep Hamels, but there is another solution. I know I'm not the first to say it, and I won't be the last, but here it is: the Phillies should trade Cole Hamels. They can get at least one very good prospect back, maybe more, and then they can attempt to re-sign him in the winter. Doing so isn't unheard of, Cliff Lee went through something similar. If the Phillies could get a player like Will Middlebrooks, for example, they should trade Hamels. Bringing in some top-level, young, talent like that would really help the team. Similarly, Shane Victorino could be traded for a prospect, but who knows who, it's too early to tell.

Third base is a problem area for us. Since Mike Schmidt, our best third basemen has been Scott Rolen. His departure was a bit sour, and we haven't had a legitimate long-term solution. Pedro Feliz, Wes Helms, Placido Polanco, and the like have performed okay, but after 2012, what do we do? Some trade/free-agent options are available, such as Jed Lowrie and Maicer Izturis. However, the free-agent market is thin, and very few are younger than 30. Obtaining someone such as Will Middlebrooks would be great, but let's be realistic, it won't happen. So, what then do the Phillies do? Ideally, they force Jimmy Rollins to move to third base and play Freddy Galvis at shortstop. Jimmy is stubborn, but if forced to, I think he would do it. After 2013, the free-agent options are better, trades more likely, and then Jimmy can move to second, or back to shortstop with Freddy to second. Or, they find a second base or shortstop free agent and keep the shifts.

The payroll is manageable. The luxury tax goes up to $189m in 2014. The Phillies will be looking for a new TV deal in 2014 or 2015, depending on if Comcast tries to renegotiate early. The income from TV deals far exceeds luxury tax problems, so as I see it the Phillies can afford to go over this threshold to bring in top-level talent. I hate to be the new Yankees, but I love to win.

The team is aging. There isn't much to do about it, but let's look at the contract status:

* 1B: Howard signed through 2016, far enough off to not worry about replacement
* 2B: Utley signed through 2013, Freddy Galvis probable successor
* SS: Rollins signed through 2014, likely 2015, Galvis possible successor
* 3B: Polanco signed through 2012, 2013 option, Galvis possible stopgap, no long-term solution
* C: Ruiz has option for 2013, Sebastian Valle is likely successor, the two are viable for several years together
* RF: Hunter Pence under team control until 2014, should be signed to extension
* CF: Victorino free-agent next year, Mayberry possible replacement, Michael Bourn and BJ Upton both FA also
* LF: John Mayberry and Domonic Brown should compete for the spot, Dom Brown is likely long-term LF

The rotation is somewhat solid. Roy Halladay is signed through 2013 with an option for 2014. Cliff Lee is signed until 2015 with a 2016 option. Vance Worley is under team control until at least 2016. Kyle Kendrick is signed for 2013. Trevor May will be MLB-ready in 2013 or 2014, to fill the hole left by Hamels, most likely, or the fifth spot. A rotation of Hamels, Halladay, Lee, Worley, and May in 2013 is possible. That would be something, wouldn't it? Other prospects such as Jesse Biddle and Brody Colvin will be ready in the 2014-2015 range, so the rotation is fine.

The bullpen is a very cheap area for the Phillies for some time. Besides Papelbon, who is signed through 2015 with an option for 2016. Bastardo should be cost-effective until he reaches free agency in 2016. Relievers Mike Stutes, Michael Schwimmer, Justin DeFratus, Jake Diekmann, Joe Savery, and Phillippe Aumont are all low-cost options, with several (DeFratus, Aumont) showing potential. For the immediate 2013 season, the entire bullpen should cost about $21m, including Papelbon, Kendrick, and possibly some free agents. That leaves plenty for the rest of the team.

As a final note, I believe that following the 2013 season, Ryne Sandberg will take over managing the Phillies."	t5_2qjl8	True

1336979792.0	tm5lo	Phils Analysis, Third Base	chaqalaqalaqa	24	6	34	"Sitting in the ballpark today listening to the people around me, I realized that a lot of people have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to the complexity of the trade and free-agent markets, and the ease of ""getting a bat"" or the like. I thought about it awhile and decided I wanted to write about the Phillies a bit. So the Phillies sub-reddit was the place to go. I'm going to post a series of analysis on the Phillies, their future, their struggles, successes, etc., to try to keep level heads.

**Third Base**

Placido Polanco has been good at third base. A lot of people have been saying ""he's done"" or ""he's an offensive black-hole"". Both of these statements are false. Polanco needs to be taken at face value - he is a very good contact hitter who rarely strikes out, and has little power. He also provides very good defense at third, and in a pinch can play second base. Let's see what he's done for the Phillies:

Career: .301/.345/.405, 5.4 BB%, 6.8 K% (BABIP: .311)

2010: 132 games, .298/.339/.386, 6 HR, 5 SB, 5.3 BB%, 7.8 K% (BABIP: .312)
2011: 122 games, .277/.335/.339, 5 HR, 3 SB, 8.0 BB%, 8.4 K% (BABIP: .292)
2012: 031 games, .282/.311/.342, 0 HR, 0 SB, 3.2 BB%, 9.6 K% (BABIP: .314)

Looking at these numbers, it's clear that 2010 was a pretty good season for Polanco. But it was also the first year in an increase in his strikeout percentage. This has continued, and he is striking out at rates much higher than normal. His average is a bit below his career average, even when an average BABIP. His power is non-existant so far, although he's doing slightly better than last season. I would say that Polanco is struggling as he gets older, and possibly losing bat speed. For this to be a successful season, he needs to walk more, but so do the rest of the Phillies. This will be a problem until Utley and Howard return - especially Howard. With them out, Polanco and others are getting more breaking balls and pitches outside the strike zone, but they are still swinging aggressively. This is causing Polanco to strike out more and walk less. If he can get his walk rate to around 5 % and his strikeout rate down to about 7.8 %, he should be able to be a big enough asset to the team to keep him playing.

A side note, Polanco is currently one hit away from his 2000th. This could be weighing on his head a bit. Either way, his defense is good enough that he should stay in the lineup most days, and definitely come in as a defensive replacement.

This year, the Phillies are paying Polanco $6.25m. That's reasonable for the defense and offense he brings, and overall his contract has been a good one for the Phillies. Although I'm sure we all wish that Ruben would have signed Adrian Beltre in 2010 for cheap, it's past now and we have to look forward. Next year, Polanco has a $5.5m mutual option with a $1m buyout. Barring a disastrous end of the year, I think the Phillies will most likely pick up the option. If so, fine, but if Polanco has a bad season, they will buy him out. This leaves them without a third baseman for the next year. There's a few options, I'll list the ones I think are common suggestions:

- Trade for a player mid-season (David Wright, Mark Reynolds, Kevin Youkilis)
- Sign a big-name 3B in the off-season (same group)
- Move Chase Utley to third, play Freddy Galvis at second
- Play Freddy Galvis at third, keep Utley at second
- Sign a lesser impact player (e.g. Maicer Izturis) or an older player (e.g. Scott Rolen)

The Phillies will still be relevant in in 2013, and 2014, and 2015, at the very least. After that we'll see. So I don't see them signing a low-impact player like Maicer Izturis, or an injury-prone veteran like Scott Rolen (not even mentioning the clubhouse problems and the hatred in the city for him). So that's out. Playing Utley at third is most likely not going to happen, due to his stubbornness. And Utley doesn't have the best arm, don't forget, so there's another reason. Playing Galvis at third makes sense, but I don't think the Phillies will go that route. Why? The next two options.

The Orioles and Mets are not contenders this year. They may have gotten off to hot starts, but the Orioles rotation stinks and the Mets just stink. This being said, third basemen Mark Reynolds and David Wright (and also Wilsom Betemit, I guess, but he's not an upgrade over Polanco) may be available. The former has a good chance to be traded out of Baltimore for some pitching prospects. The latter seemed more likely 3 months ago, but the Wilpon's finances aren't as bad as previously thought, and the Mets fans need at least one star. Plus, [the Mets are likely going to sign Wright to a big deal soon](http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2012/05/mets-likely-to-offer-wright-a-long-term-deal.html). So, for either a trade or a signing, I hate to break it to you all, but David Wright is **not** going to be wearing red and white pinstripes.

This leaves one very interesting player: Kevin Youkilis. The ""Greek God of Walks"" if you've seen Moneyball. The Red Sox's third baseman seems to be available, or will be soon, due to the emergence of Will Middlebrooks in Boston. Add in some bad blood between Youk and Bobby Valentine, and that his contract is up after 2012 (minus the option), and Youkilis could be moved for pitching or prospects. Youkilis is making $12m this year. If the Phillies were to acquire him at the trade deadline for say, Joe Blanton and a single-A prospect or cash, they could pick up his $13m 2013 option, or sign him to an extension. If they don't want to trade for him mid-season, he will be available for trade or signing in the off-season.

From 2008 to 2010, Youkilis was good. And I mean good: .308/.404/.560, 75 HR, 12 BB%, 18.2 K%

The move to third base in 2011 seemed to hurt him slightly, but he provides a reasonable defense at third with something the Phillies sorely need - a patient approach, and a right-handed power threat. He could slide into the lineup hitting just about anywhere. Imagine this lineup for 2013 (assuming Victorino stays) with HR estimates

SS Rollins    (20)
2B Utley      (20)
CF Victorino (20)
1B Howard   (35)
3B Youkilis   (25)
RF Pence     (25)
LF Brown     (15)
C  Ruiz        (10)
Starting Pitcher

That would be a very good lineup, with around 170 home runs. The 2011 Phillies hit 153. The 2011 Yankees hit 222. So, with about 185 home runs including bench players and pitchers, the Phillies would be making an improvement. Youkilis would provide stability behind Howard.

Realistically, to acquire him mid-season, the Phillies would likely have to send Blanton and a minor leaguer. During the off-season, if there's interest shown by teams, they will likely pick up his option and that will cost the Phillies a pitching prospect - perhaps Vance Worley, maybe someone better like Brody Colvin or Jesse Biddle. But the Phillies should make every effort to get Youkilis if he is healthy at the trade deadline, unless Polanco is tearing it up. He will be 33 next year. A contract for 2013-2016 would not be out of the question, at about $10m-$13m a year, with an option on the backend.

Whether you believe he should have ran it out fully, or whether you believe that he was minimizing his injury risk, it just isn't worth fighting about! And it CERTAINLY isn't worth calling someone a racist about. Whatever reasons people have for feeling the way they do about that play, it's just not worth making such a sweeping indictment of another person's character from.

This season is winding down, quickly. The Phils are pretty much cooked. We all need to just relax after the disaster of the season we just had and enjoy some baseball while we still have it. Fighting over bullshit like this that the national media, who just can not wait for the Phils' run to be over and love to create drama and tension to drive up readership, shoves down our throat isn't helping anything. 

He didn't run as hard as he could have. It didn't matter in that game, and that game didn't matter to the season, but most of all, it's done. The Phils have a LOT of work to do and a LOT of hard choices to make. It's not like we don't have anything to talk about and argue over, why waste our time and energy getting pissed at each other over fucking nothing?

1359042148.0	176ywm	STOP! Please, stop using batting average exclusively to evaluate a hitter.  You're doing it wrong like Ruben Amaro, Jr.	j42justin	30	16	29	"Guys, you need to stop using batting average to compare hitters.  While some of the statistic has to do with skill, it doesn't fully measure how good a hitter is when comparing between one player and another.

Why?  Well, a player's OBP is far more important.  Why? The more often your team reaches base, the better chance it is for your team to score runs.

First, let's look at Delmon Young.  His batting average the last two years have been .268 and .267.  Not great, but nothing to really be impressed with.  Then, you have to take into consideration that his OBP was .302 and .296.  This means Delmon Young didn't reach base roughly 70% of his at-bats.  The NL average for OBP last year was .318 AND THAT NUMBER INCLUDES PITCHERS!  Delmon Young is below average.

Delmon Young is not a good hitter.  He's not a good fielder.  Hell, he's not really good at anything other than having 18-20 good swings a year.

In comparison, let's look at Chase Utley, who we would all say had down years the last two years.

Chase Utley hit about .258 the last two years, however he had a .344 OBP and a .365 OBP the last two years.  Chase Utley, with the lower batting average still was more productive at the plate because he reached base more often.

What's the difference besides just walking more?  Teams will throw more strikes at a guy like Young or Revere because they know both guys are more likely to get themselves out more often than the average.  Ben Revere could develop more, yet people need to stop acting like a guy with a .333 batting average should be leading them off.  Jimmy Rollins career OBP is .328.  Is it really an upgrade for someone like Ben Revere who has little to zero real offensive ability outside of speed to get the most at-bats in a season?

Makes zero sense to me.  Sorry, just tired of people using batting average in any argument.  Talk about OBP or Slugging.  But fuck, stop talking about batting average as an end all, be all.  It is largely based on simply where the ball falls."	t5_2qjl8	True

1335310666.0	sqt6o	My prediction for the 2012 season	Lionel_McClure	27	11	7	"After 17 games, here's how I see the rest of 2012 going down: This season the Phillies will both score AND allow fewer than 250 runs, leading to an improbable 87 wins. Ryan Howard will play 14 games (all of them in August) and lead the team on the season with 9 homers. Chase Utley's first PA this season will be a bases loaded, walk off HBP to win to the aforementioned 87th game on the last day of the season. The moment will be bittersweet, as the pitch hits Utley in the knee and causes his right leg to detach from that point downward. Still, this win total will be good enough to get them into the new one game playoff, against an as of yet undetermined opponent, who will be the home team. This game will be started by Roy Halladay, who will pitch 14 perfect innings. In the top of the 15th, the Phils will get the lead runner on, after which Freddy Galvis will bunt into a double play. The next batter, pinch hitting for Doc, will pop up weakly to third. Halladay will be relieved by Cliff Lee, who will then proceed to throw nine scoreless innings, allowing 1 baserunner (a Raul Ibanez - acquired at the deadline for Domonic Brown - error) and fanning 23. In the top of the 24th, Rollins will lead off with a triple. Ty Wigginton, in the middle of an 0-97 hitless streak, will then strike out three consecutive times, defying what was until now believed to be the rules of baseball. Charlie Manuel will later be praised for this unorthodox tactic, saying, ""Well, what were the odds he'd strike out all three times? He was due."" Cole Hamels, pitching on 2 days rest, will come in for Lee. He will proceed to throw 7 scoreless innings, striking out 11 and recording two base hits of his own in the process. In the top of the 31st, the Phillies will load the bases with no one out, on an improbable sequence of HBP, dropped 3rd strike and catcher's interference. Jim Thome, pinch hitting for Hamels, will run the count full, foul off 11 pitches, and then hit into a quadruple play to end the inning. In the bottom of the 31st, Manuel will turn to Antonio Bastardo to face the first batter of the inning, who will be a lefty. Bastardo will strike him out on three pitches. Despite the fact that the next 4 batters will all be right-handed, Manuel will NOT elect to bring in his $50 million closer, stating later that ""it wasn't a save situation."" Bastardo gives up a single and a walk. At this point cameras actually catch Jonathan Papelbon with his dick literally in his hand in the bullpen, using his other hand to light a cigar with a burning $100 bill. The next batter will hit a bloop single to left, which Ibanez will field cleanly, but his throw to the plate will bounce four times as the winning run scores standing up. Game over (total time elapsed: 1 hour, 57 minutes). Season over. Manuel will be applauded for getting the Phils to ""the postseason"" for a 6th consecutive season. Four months later the Eagles will win the Super Bowl*, Hamels will sign with the Dodgers, and no one will ever attend another Phils game again. Will it all have been worth it for Phillies fans? Probably. But it's gonna be a bumpy final few months. You heard it here first.

Dom Brown probably isn't going to be the next Barry Bonds, but acting like the 2011 season is indicative of anything significant is awfully silly. Even the best hitters can sometimes take a season or so to adjust to major league hitting, and Brown's stat-line has about half the playing time as Bonds' does. Also, people upset about Brown's defense should relax as well, as the same standard applies there as well.

Give him a full season at the major league level and then start talking.

EDIT: May be worth noting that both of those stat-lines are at least as good, if not a decent bit better than Ibanez's 2011 stats."	t5_2qjl8	True

I was ready to throw the radio at the wall after hearing Qualls blow that save earlier today. The positive angle there would be saying that he's not a closer and it's a lot to ask to have him get three outs in a pressure situation in the ninth. The more realistic angle that I take is that he's a reliever and getting three outs with a two run lead against a horrible team should not be that difficult! But I digress.

Where was I? Oh, right. With that win today, the Phillies are only 4.5 games back of first place. I realize we were spoiled by last year's 102 win season, with no real threat to the division. But almost every other year since 2007 we have always had to deal with adversity within the division. Let's provide a little history so we can all remember that we were not always in first place from the beginning of the year to the end of the year:

2007: Everybody remembers the comeback year, right? Mets were up in the division by 7 games on September 12. Phils rallied and whittled down the lead until the last game of the season, eventually taking over.

2008: As of September 10, the team was down 3.5 games in the division behind the Mets. Obviously, they turned things around.

2009: Aside from early on, the Phillies actually pretty much lead the division all year. They had a slow April and were down 2 games in the division. They never had a serious threat that year, though.

2010: July 15th - Phillies are 5.5 games behind the Braves. If you go from there, the Phillies were always trailing behind them until September. The Oswalt trade helps them gain ground on the Braves until eventually pulling away with the division.

Now, look. I understand this team isn't the same as the ones we've been used to. But how can you write them off when it's only May? Even if they were 5 games up in the division, I'd still be saying it's way too early to celebrate. You have to hang in there and realize it's a loooong season and you can't overreact, good or bad. Also, I can grant you that the division is better than how it's been in the past. But it's still not a great division. This isn't exactly the AL East here. And hey, if we can get Howard back, that's a definite plus. He's always there to carry the team through the regular season. 

Now, if you want to say they're not going to do anything in the playoffs, I won't exactly argue with you there. But as long as you have Halladay, Lee and Hamels, I think you've always got a shot."	t5_2qjl8	True

Maybe I'm a sucker, but I still want to see the Phills in the playoffs.  I know we're in a position that's next to impossible, but stranger things have happened, right?  With exception to the Rockies and Astros, we have a lower winning percentage than every team we're facing.  Tonight may have been a fluke, but it was quite a show.  I know I'm being hopelessly romantic, but I love these guys.  Here's to the next 59?"	t5_2qjl8	True
1343703956.0	xfg72	An analysis of what the 2013 Phillies may look like.  (If Victorino, Wigginton, Pierre, and Blanton get traded, this is where they stand.)  	the_scientist_120	19	5	22	"This scenario considers what is most likely, considering where the front office and Amaro stand as of now.  This means that Victorino, Wigginton, Pierre, and Blanton all get traded, while Lee and Pence do not.  
That leaves the roster at:  
**Starters**  
1. Roy Halladay (RHP; 20M next year, signed through 2013 w/ 2014 option)  
2. Cliff Lee (LHP; 25M next year, signed through 2015 w/ 2016 option)  
3. Cole Hamels (LHP; 24M next year, signed through 2018 w/ 2019 option)  
4. Vance Worley (no contract for next year yet)  
5. ??? (I’ll address this in a few paragraphs)  
This brings the total, so far, to 69M guaranteed next year.  
**Bullpen**  
1. Kyle Kendrick (LRP; 4.5M next year)  
2. Jose Contreras?  (MRP; he has a club option next year, if they decline, 0.5M buyout.  Will address later.)  
3. ???  
4. ???  
5. ???  
6. ???  
7. Jonathan Papelbon (Closer; 13M next year, signed through 2015 w/ 2016 vesting option)  
Bastardo, Stutes, Schwimer, Horst, De Fratus, Savery, Herndon, and Diekman all need new contracts.  
This brings the total, not counting Contreras, to 86.5 guaranteed.  
**Infield**  
1. Ryan Howard (1B; 20M next year, signed through 2016 w/ 2017 option)  
2. Chase Utley (2B; 15M next year, signed through 2013)  
3. Jimmy Rollins (SS; 11M next year, signed through 2014 w/ 2015 vesting option)  
4. Placido Polanco (3B; 5.5M next year if Phillies accept mutual option; 0.5M buyout)  
5.  ???  
6.  ???  
Frandsen, Fontenot, and Luna all need new contracts.  
This brings the total, not counting Polanco or Contreras, to 132.5M.  
**Outfield**  
1. Laynce Nix (OF; 1.35M next year, signed through next year)  
2. ???  
3. ???  
4. ???  
5. ???  
Mayberry, Pence, and Brown all need new contracts.  
**Catchers**  
1. Carlos Ruiz (5M club option for next year)  
2. Brian Schneider and Erik Kratz need new contracts.  
*Bottom line*: 11 of these guys are locked up for next year, and we’ve already spent 138.85 MILLION.  
Plus, Pence and Worley need new contracts for next year, and Utley needs a new contract after 2013.  
Should Contreras stay?  Looks like it might be necessary.  Who else do you want to pitch?  
Should Polanco stay?  No.  We should move him now and call up Cody Overbeck from AAA in 2013.  Here’s his Fangraphs page: http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa454914&amp;position=1B/3B
Here’s Polanco’s: http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1176&amp;position=2B/3B
Overbeck bests Polanco in nearly every statistic; his higher BABIP (.300 compared to .272) is an improvement, albeit a small one.  And for those fans of traditional statistics, Overbeck wins again.  Overbeck has 51 RBIs this season, as opposed to Polanco’s abysmal 19.  
Need a third baseman?  Why not Overbeck?  (Heh, Futurama reference)
So that solves the third baseman problem.  Now for the two infield bench positions.  Who do we have in AAA?  Pretty much no one except Martinez, Frandsen, Orr, and Luna.  Who are our free agent options?  Well, if we want cheap free agents, all I was able to find was Geoff  Blum (just released by the D-backs) Miguel Cairo, and Brandon Inge.  Whoa, Brandon Inge?  I mean, his stats don’t exactly blow you away, but he’s just the kind of player the Phillies need.  A gamer.  Someone who runs out every play.  Forget what I said about Overbeck.  Make him the backup for Inge, the new 3B.  Knowing the Phillies, they’ll sign someone like Miguel Cairo.  But trust me, that’s what we don’t want them to do.  We want to get younger.  Cairo is 38.  NO.  
So I say, keep Luna as a bench bat, but keep him on a short leash.  If he doesn’t hit, release him and try Frandsen.  
Ugh, the outfield.  Let’s say we do re-sign Pence to play right, about 10M a year?  Sounds right.  Brown needs to play center.  Every day.  Consistently.  It’s time.  As for Mayberry, one more year.  This year was basically an off year for *everyone*, so try him one more time in left, every day.  Nix on the bench.  The last spot should go to a free agent we shouldn’t have gotten rid of in the first place!
Aaron Rowand.  
He’s a free agent next year.  Some might argue he doesn’t hit as well anymore.  Off the bench, no, he doesn’t hit.  When he played every day, however, his WAR (wins above replacement) was *6*.  That is all-star material.  
For the last catching spot, it will come down to Schneider vs. Kratz.  I won’t even use stats here.  The Phillies need to save money.  Schneider has not hit.  Kratz, in his limited time here, has.  Kratz will be cheaper.  Go with Kratz.  
As for the starters, Worley will get a new contract for sure.  That leaves one spot empty.  
Tyler Cloyd.  Obviously.  [The stats speak for themselves.](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=sa455303&amp;position=P)
And the bullpen.  Saved the biggest problem for last.  We do have Papelbon and Kendrick locked up.  Contreras, like I said, should stay.  That leaves four open spots.  One should go to Stutes, and one, as much as I hate to say it, needs to go to Bastardo.  As for the last two, we should keep Horst (he’s been okay, I guess.) and sign one free agent.  Looking at the list of free agents for the offseason, barring they aren’t re-signed, the cheapest would be Peter Moylan.  Remember him?  Braves sidearmer?  He will be extremely cheap, and fill up a roster spot until Aumont is ready.  (Should be next year.)  Also, De Fratus is definitely a possibility for next year.  
2013 will not blow us away.  But wait patiently, Phillies fans, for prospects like Pettibone, May, Rodriguez, Bonilla, Hernandez, Gilles, James, and Valle should all be ready by 2014.  The new wave of homegrown talent is coming.  
2013 roster, in my opinion, should be:
Halladay, Lee, Hamels, Worley, Cloyd, Contreras, Kendrick, Stutes, Bastardo, Horst, Moylan (interchangeable with De Fratus/Aumont), Papelbon, Howard, Utley, Rollins, Inge, Overbeck, Luna, Mayberry, Nix, Pence, Brown, Rowand, Ruiz, Kratz.  
tl;dr: don’t expect a ring in 2013, call up Overbeck and Cloyd, sign Inge and Rowand, maybe Moylan if we have to, also Amaro spends money like it’s burning a hole in his pocket, that’s why we’re having problems in the first place.  The Phillies literally cannot afford to sign expensive talent anymore because of him, so we have to look for cheap players and hope to strike gold.  
Let the discussion begin!  Obviously this is a flawed analysis, so I want to hear what you guys think the Phillies should do. 

EDIT: Completely forgot about Galvis.  He will be the backup, no doubt, so keep Luna in AAA and make Overbeck the other bench infielder.  "	t5_2qjl8	True
