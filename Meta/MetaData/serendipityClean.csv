1353292263.0	13fghr	[META] Some updates to /r/serendipity. Thoughts appreciated!	umbrae	26	1	11	"Hi Folks,

I've [made some edits](https://github.com/umbrae/Serendipity/compare/39bbeb4f59a1b5e00ad0589e39b2c263f3bf8a38...8a1baf4cfb5d85b33b5338b78f3dcf96de079f2b) to Serendipity's engine today, primarily:

1. NSFW links should now be marked as NSFW if their root post was NSFW as well. Sorry about the ones that have snuck through!

2. I've disabled crossposting from the default subreddits, as those are already well traveled and don't need discovering by anyone.

3. I've added a comment to be posted onto the crosspost's comments thread to help exposure of serendipity. It looks like this:

&gt; This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Serendipity/comments/13f0vy/what_are_some_good_chinese_shows_i_can_watch_with/  

If anyone has any thoughts on whether that seems spammy or not, or suggestions on ways to improve serendipity, I'd love to hear them."	t5_2ql4j	True

Last month on around the 17th of November I introduced a feature that would add a comment to the source post letting the subreddit know that the post was featured in Serendipity. I was a bit concerned about it being spammy but was also interested in seeing the possible growth.

Here are the results:

[Uniques by Day](http://i.imgur.com/eD9dN.png)

[Pageviews by Day](http://i.imgur.com/mm7h8.png)

[Subscriptions by Day](http://i.imgur.com/VLzaD.png)

[Traffic Table by Day](http://i.imgur.com/ZuN02.png)

In addition, the comment has been a fairly uncontroversial addition in the source subreddits, which I've been happy to see - it usually sticks at 1 or is upvoted a few times. I'll be letting it stick around and keeping an eye in case the tide turns.

As usual, any thoughts on how Serendipity could be more serendipitous appreciated.
