**EDIT 2: #StopGCSBbill Twitter Hashtag.**


Original Post:
&gt; When ""Skynet"" passed it faced pretty strong internet and even public opposition. 

&gt; It was a bill that was hated because it saw the guilty verdict based on the IP address and not necessarily the Person who did the crime. 

&gt; But at least public opposition saw the repeal of Section 92 B). 
Just like then, the govt is passing legislation it doesn't actually understand, and just like then we need to make them change their mind with the only language they know Public opposition, and cost them votes.

&gt; Yesterday there was public submissions on the GCSB Bill and I'm saddened to think there will not be equal if not more public opposition to this bill, as it effects everyone, not just internet users.

&gt; It is a bill that has been said to be even further reaching than the Patriot act in the United States, and I can see why.

&gt; It includes provision for spying ""where not otherwise legal"". Which seems fairly universal to me.

&gt; When John Key yesterday heard for the first time ever that communications could be encrypted and not captured by the GCSB, his response was to spin this as ""people who mind about their privacy being breached can always do this"" Failing to realize that people who are worth spying on will all be doing this, while people who are innocent will see their privacy breached for no good reason.

&gt; Privacy may be hard to define, but we all want it. There is a reason that warrants exist, and police can't just walk into your house and ransack it because they felt like you might just have something to hide.

&gt; People are not perfect and thus neither can the justice system be perfect. Around the world we see abuse of the powers granted to these agencies. Kate Dewes gave her tale of how she has been spied upon for years yesterday, with a story seeming so surreal that it seems it couldn't be true, except for the mountain of evidence she has to back it up. 

&gt; I am not arguing to dismantle these agencies, nor saying there shouldn't be some spying for our security, but I do think the New Zealand people should demand much greater oversight of these people, it should demand much stricter rules, and it should not vest the GCSB with a domestic spying role. 

&gt; Thomas Beagle of Tech Liberty made a salient point. John Key's ""think of the families"" argument could be used to justify a camera in every home. There's clearly a continuum to the power we allot these agencies. Clearly it can go too far resulting in us moving away from being a liberal democracy and into an authoritarian state. When the power we grant these agencies is unlimited, then I would argue that it's a pretty big step toward the latter.

&gt; I believe we need to respond the same way we did before. We need to get angry.

&gt; Let's start campaigning and protest against this shit.
I Propose we use this thread to start this in our own communities. 
When skynet was going through, we blacked out the internet, and got support from Stephen Fry of all people.  Let's do this shit again. 

TL;DR, This shit is fucked yo Lets get angry, and show them we're angry.

We lived through them and we are living with the rebuild.  So, when you choose to promote your network with disaster porn and rub your hands with glee as you see viewership/readership increase, knowing advertisers will pay higher premiums, just know that respect and humility sometimes goes a long way.

You do nothing for the city by focusing on the broken and wounded few.  You can do the right thing and be positive about this city and this country.  You can be an example for what NZ should be like.  Remember those who were lost and memorialise the day in an appropriate fashion - but know this, every time you show buildings come crashing down, just so you have an excuse to show it, you lose the respect and dignity that true journalism once had.

I may be a lone voice on the matter - but I feel it's important to say it - disasters don't need to be glorified.  We cannot move forward as a city when fear and destruction is perpetuated.  Show the rebuilding - show the growth - show the strength - then you'll regain the respect that I and many others had for you.

NotionAquarium	266	28	104	"I've been in New Zealand nearly a year on a working holiday visa. I'm leaving mid-March and wanted to see if I could get a tax return before leaving the country. All I have to do is fill out a 2-page form. IRD does every thing else for me.

The lovely staff also informed me I had been contributing to Kiwi Saver when I was ineligible to do so (because I'm on a working holiday), so they're going to refund my contributions. Awesome.

In Canada, we're expected to file tax returns manually. There are computer programs to help you fill out your tax returns. We get tax summary forms (T4 slips) for each employer that total all earnings, tax contributions, etc.. We have to enter all of the information from our tax summary forms into our tax return forms. The process is stress-inducing for most Canadians. In New Zealand, my employers forward all my tax information straight to IRD. Too easy.

TL;DR New Zealand's tax system is far superior to Canada's."	t5_2qhma	True

As some of you may have heard, three of my classmates from Boston University were killed in a crash last Saturday morning. The students were studying abroad in Auckland through a university program, and crashed on their way to a hiking trip. Though I did not know any victims personally, many of the people around me were good friends with them, and their loss has brought tremendous grief to our community. 

I myself will be participating in this same program starting in July, so this tragedy will continue to be in my mind as I prepare for, and begin my journey to study in New Zealand.

Most importantly, I wanted to say thank you, to all of the kiwis, and felt this post was one way to do so before I get there in July. Thank you for the support your country has given our community from half a world away. People who have no association with BU or the program in Auckland have sent messages and sympathies, and posted many comments in our university's reports, which you can see here: 

http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/three-students-dead-in-new-zealand-crash/#comments

Despite the whirlwind of emotion that our community has faced as we think of the victims' friends and families, the support from your country has done nothing but confirmed my excitement to study there. It has given me and my classmates who will be going there in July confidence and reassurance about the whole ordeal.

Again, thank you, New Zealand, and I can't wait to see you soon."	t5_2qhma	True

AMA about why most of the comments in yesterday's abortion thread pissed me off and why New Zealand's abortion laws are in serious need of reform.	ReallyLoveLee	279	86	225	"In [yesterday's mega abortion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/10l89u/government_urged_to_decriminalise_abortion/), I found it really frustrating that so many of you were willing to give your opinions about something you'd never personally experienced. I am a 26 year old woman who had an abortion last year, and I want to share my story and hopefully debunk a few myths about the process and why I think the law needs to be changed.

Firstly, the perception that only irresponsible, promiscuous women get abortions is just bullshit. I had been with my partner for eight years and had been on long-term contraception since I was 17. I had had a copper IUD for two years, which has a failure rate of 0.1% per year.

My period was late which was fairly unusual, but I brushed it off as being stress-related since I was in the process of starting a new job. I was joking with a friend who brought up a previous pregnancy scare she'd had, so I thought I'd do a test just in case.

Well, shit. The test was positive. I handed the test to my partner and said ""You're going to be a daddy! We'd better call Family Planning"". He was stunned, to say the least, and he asked me what I wanted to do - he said that he'd support whatever I decided because it was my body and my decision. I reaffirmed that I was going to make an appointment with Family Planning asap, to get an abortion. 

Contrary to popular belief, abortion wasn't a hard decision. I was about to start a new job, and I had already put a lot of thought into my future aspirations, which didn't include kids for at least another five years. Having a baby would have fucked up all my plans, and all my partner's plans as well. 

From the day I went into Family Planning, it was about two weeks until I got the abortion. In those two weeks I had multiple appointments with doctors and gynaecologists who measured and documented my foetus. In none of these appointments was I ever asked about my wellbeing (well, except when they had a probe stuck up my vajayjay). 

I felt the process was far too long. I was pregnant and I didn't want to be - it seemed pointless that they were meticulously documenting the existence of my domed foetus.

During the tests I was a bit of an emotional wreck, partly because of the physical and hormonal changes, but mainly because of all the red tape and bullshit that accompanied the process. All I wanted was to get it over and done with and get on with my life (and my new job). At one point I joked to my partner that it felt like it would be easier just to have the baby!

The clinic itself was scary, hidden away behind layers of security. Only people on a pre-approved list were allowed to enter, and any support people needed to be noted down. When I walked in, were nine or ten other women there. The room wasn't filled with stereotypes - there were women of different ages, ethnicities and backgrounds. No one spoke and the room was was filled with an eerie tension. At one point I remember having a rush of paranoia which left me feeling ashamed, embarrassed and and judged for what I was about to do. 

When it was my turn I had to go through the process of getting signed off by two doctors and a counsellor. I saw the counsellor first, very briefly, and she was professional, understanding and respected my decision. She asked me some basic questions like what my first thought was, how my partner reacted, why I thought it was the right decision, what my future plans were. Following the counsellor I had an appointment with the first doctor who went through the two abortion options that I had (which was the *only* difficult decision that I made during the whole process) she explained the risks involved in each one. Then I saw a final doctor (the same one who actually carried out the procedure) and she had a checklist to confirm everything had been explained to me and I understood what was about to happen. We had a conversation about the legal issues surrounding abortion and she admitted that it was just senseless red tape and that she wished she could make the process easier. 

The procedure started with three suppositories that I had to insert myself using some lube they provided. I was then partially sedated before being taken away. They put my legs in stirrups and my arms in restraints before vacuuming out the contents of my womb. It was horribly painful even with the drugs - I'm tearing up just remembering it. The pain is really hard to describe, or maybe it's just hard to remember since I've tried to black out those memories. It stings like a bitch and it feels like someone is scraping out your insides (because they are). 

Reading the thread yesterday, some comments really upset me. Especially ones like this, from [pikkie_Greg:](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/10l89u/government_urged_to_decriminalise_abortion/c6ejfyz)
&gt; I just fear if you make it so easy to go get one, people will start to abuse it.

What. The. Fuck. Trust me, no-one would want to go through that more than once.

Or how about [this one:](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/10l89u/government_urged_to_decriminalise_abortion/c6elddx)
&gt; it's not terribly hard to get an abortion here... I can guarantee it's not something that needs to be drastically fixed.

It's a lot harder than it needs to be. The process is just about ticking boxes - we need to redesign the process so that it actually looks after the individual well-being of the woman, rather than her doomed foetus. I don't think anyone should be forced to see a counsellor if they don't want to. The option should be there, but if you've already made up your mind, nothing a counsellor says is going to change that.

**tl;dr**

Abortions suck! The process required by New Zealand law makes it worse - it's a 1970s throwback from a law which was only written to appease fundie pro-lifers. Fuck you all if you think the status quo is acceptable or if you think you have *any* right to tell me what I can and cannot do with *my* body.

1360532705.0	189n13	Putting a face on child abuse	Naly_D	219	28	140	"Hi friends, it was great to meet some of you on Saturday and you now know who I am!

Now, I don't usually do SRS here but today marks 10 years since the last night I spent in my birth mother's care and I've decided it's time to put myself out there and become a public face so to speak. The crux of it is that she was/is a child abuser.

[This AMA was me](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/mwocy/i_am_a_nzer_who_grew_up_in_an_abusive_home_and/).

I spent 14 years in her care and my memory is quite hazy for the first 7 or 8 of them, but the first incident brought came when I was 4 and turned up to kindergarten with adult bite marks on my arms and legs. My CYFS file notes I was reluctant to talk but after several days explained my mother had done it because I had gotten out of bed.

There are a lot of specific events I can remember, and after I got to high school they got infinitely worse. I will not go into specifics here but among the worst incidents I have been waterboarded several times, which is fucked, I only learnt that's what it is around 2006. I was made to strip naked almost nightly once I hit puberty, when I was beaten and humiliated for minor disagreements. I was refused food unless I met some very specific targets every day, which could change without notice, meaning in 4th and 5th form I was more or less eating dinner 3 times a week.

Ironically the report of that final night is nowhere near the normal level, and it's one of 3 or 4 times I lashed out myself, but it's here; http://i.imgur.com/M8D3NmV.jpg for proof in case some doubt the legitimacy of my claims.

I had no idea what was happening wasn't normal for children, as I was isolated from the world for those 14 years, aside from going to school, school-related extra-curricular activities (sports, school camps etc) or to social functions with her and her partner that was more or less it. There were no sleepovers, there was no playing in the park after school, even watching cartoons was an illicit activity where I used to have to run home after school to sneak 5 minutes or so of Dragon Ball Z before I heard her key in the door and had to turn the TV off. As a direct result, social interactions are not really my strong suit but I'm improving over the past 4 years.

It was only because of one of my classmates in 3rd form who contacted the guidance counsellor when I turned up to school with bruising around my neck, with very distinguishable finger marks, that the started ball rolling on a 2 year fight - and it was a real fight as I struggled to a) convince myself what was happening was not ok and b) convince CYFS it was happening, while it was worsening because I'd contacted CYFS and she did not like that.

I was not a great teenager, and for years I have still used this as a way to justify some of the treatment I received but it is only recently I realised my poor behaviour was a result of her treatment of me, not the cause of it.

The past decade has been an incredible struggle, and the next will continue to be as I work through the issues which are still present as a result of my upbringing. I am reminded of that bitch daily through the scars on my body and the memories which can pop up at any time. Ultimate trust is still a foreign concept to me and I am far more anxious and fleeting at any given time that I let on.

I have kept this a secret from the majority of the population out of shame and embarrassment. I felt it reflected badly on me as a person, that I was ""weak"" for not doing something earlier than I did, or hitting her back, or something.

Also because there is a stigma with being an abused child who spent time in state care. We are supposed to be failures, we are the ones who get into fights and steal and do drugs and have no hope in life. For several years I was that stereotype, but the hard work of my parents paid off and I like to think I am achieving things nobody would have thought possible out of me even at 17 years old.

There are other children out there who have it worse than I did, and I was incredibly lucky to have my father and stepmother, who may not have physically given birth to me but is more of a mother in every way than mine will ever be.

I hate to think there are countless other kids in this country in the same situation with nobody to fight for them and I implore you, if you suspect something is occurring, get on top of it early. I'll be dealing with the fallout from this well into my 30s, possibly my entire life. No person should need to live with that.

It's still a terrifying world knowing you all now have access to this information and can judge me by it as you see fit. But not as terrifying as the world that existed between those concrete walls of our apartment at 135 Britomart Street."	t5_2qhma	True

Even I'm getting worried now. LOL. That was quite large.

Felt it very strongly here in Wellington. Yikes.  

EDIT: Has just been upgraded to 6.9. [Here is the quake on GeoNet.](http://geonet.org.nz/quakes/region/newzealand/2013p543824). Please fill out a felt it form to help our seismologists continue to better understand New Zealand's faults. 

EDIT 2: Back to 6.5, has been reviewed by a GeoNet scientist, so that's probably the final magnitude. 17km deep, 20km east of Seddon. 

EDIT 3: Stuff is reporting 6.8. Then again, it's Stuff. 

EDIT 4: [TVNZ is the first to report about it, calling it a 6.9](http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/6-9-magnitude-quake-strikes-central-new-zealand-5515737). 

EDIT 5: [Stuff now reporting in.](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8945358/Big-quake-shakes-central-New-Zealand). Seems to be some minor damage in Blenheim. 

EDIT 6: Some people are without power, some have broken plates. Bucket fountain apparently continues to function. 

EDIT 7: Being reported on in Australia now. Quake occurred at 5:09pm. This is the third truly large quake we've had over the same number of days. Felt all the way from Dunedin to Auckland, 5000+ Felt it reports on GeoNet. 

EDIT 8: [CNN reporting in.](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/21/world/asia/new-zealand-earthquake/?hpt=hp_t3) Everyone, please check and clear your facebook &amp; twitter feeds. No doubt they're full by now.

Just got a call from him, on an obviously overseas number, talking about the place, saying that if I paid 2mths rent and $600 bond, I could have the keys by Saturday.

I was stoked.

He wanted the money transferred in some weird way, through westernunion or something. The account was in Nigeria. Uh oh. Called Dad, he said it sounded suspicious AS.

Nek minnit, get an email from nzflatemates.co.nz saying the property profile had been removed due to suspicious/fraudulent activity. WTF.

**UPDATE:**
Night all, sorry, after a few hours I have to go now to write some questions and speech I'm giving to a rally at parliament tomorrow.

Thanks so much for all your questions and I’m sorry if I didn't get to yours - first time on reddit so may have missed some.

They are captured by the Sheik and are sentenced to death, until his wife runs up to him and whispers something in his ear. She glances to the New Zealander, and whispers some more.

The sheik steps forward and announces: ""Because it is my wife's birthday today, she has asked that I spare your lives, on the following terms. You will each get 20 lashes, but will receive one wish before you do. However, since my wife and I admire New Zealand's beautiful countryside, we will allow the New Zealander two wishes.""

The Australian is up first, and asks for a pillow to be tied to his back. However, after the first few lashes, the pillow breaks. Then, the American asks for TWO pillows to be tied to his back. Again, they break after but five lashes. Finally, the New Zealander steps forward. ""First,"" he says, ""I would like to be given 40 lashes, not 20.""

Its not an actual petition, but comment if you agree/disagree, if im the only one that wants it gone then so be it. 

I certainly poked a hornets nest here didn't. If we go on upvotes it looks like the majority support the position to remove it, if we go on comments its a bit harder to decide, both sides have raised some pretty good points I'd say. At least the discussion was lively. "	t5_2qhma	True

1329534273.0	puse7	Was admitted to hospital on Friday and couldn't believe the treatment I was given !!	flicticious	147	16	90	"I literally waited 3 minutes to be seen. I wan't even finished filling out the form they gave me! Before I could even cover myself with a blanket on the bed there were three people attending me. Blood work was completed and a range of doctors came to see me. I was referred immediately to a neurosurgeon whom came and saw me within the hour.

I was booked for a CT scan, given lunch and told to have a sleep. Woken up to be taken through to the scan room then afterwards off the the ward to be fed dinner and checked again.

When the surgeon came in to talk to me about further treatment, after reviewing the scans in 15 minutes he said I would need a further MRI on Monday. Being that it was 7pm on a Friday evening I asked if having private medical insurance would make a difference. He stopped to think for a moment and then said ""nah, you're here now and we'd prefer to keep you in for observation and have you seen on Monday, private won't speed things up.""

So I've been waited on hand and foot for the last 24 hours, have markedly improved but still not out of the woods.

I just wanted to say that the national health care system in New Zealand is fantastic and I""m proud to be a kiwi.


**Edit**: UPDATE: The MRI is being completed through my private medical insurance to get it done sooner. They sent me home yesterday afternoon as they said it would be probably a week of waiting for public scheduling. Private got me an appointment at 1:30pm today. Now I understand why public waiting lists can take a long time, people like me come along and get appointments which push all other people back a slot.

I would have paid cash to get this sorted quicker (if I'd had to and could have).


**Edit 2:** It was a spontaneous tear of the Carotid artery which is healing. I'll be on meds for at least 6 months (possibly life). Diagnosis is good. I'll potentially have uneven dilation of the pupils forever (just like David Bowie !)

To all the new members who signed up today on the bequest of your spiritual commodore Cameron ""Whale Oil"" Slater, welcome to Reddit! You will find a community of people who are in large part clever, diverse and respectful of others. You might have a hard time adjusting to this, but I want to also say that I welcome your questions.

So I’m a boy from Gisborne who grew up loving cars and not really caring about politics, but moving to study at Victoria university I got into environmentalism; met my wife, turned vegetarian and started getting active in environmental and progressive causes. I was privileged to make a career at Greenpeace before entering Parliament as the youngest MP last term (I’m no longer the youngest, just the youngest looking) and this term I’m the Greens musterer (whip) and I’m focusing on clean energy, healthy oceans and a free and open Internet. I live in Wellington and have two kids.

You can read more about me here: http://www.greens.org.nz/people/garethhughes

I look forward to your questions.

It's been [brought](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/l2lf0/keys_throatslashing_gesture_after_yesterdays/c2pi8yk) to my attention that there's some serious astro-turfing being done here by the New Zealand Green Party. People signed up as their ""[online activists](https://my.greens.org.nz/online-activists)"" get email alerts about topics on /r/nz (and other websites) - e.g. [1](http://i.imgur.com/ZU2Wv.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/AdVXf.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/jmTQy.png). This is probably done via an automated bot sniffing /r/nz for certain keywords. The online ""activists"" then get ""achievement stars"" for signing up to the site, and promoting the Green Party. 

[David Farrar](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/blogs/david-farrar-by-the-numbers/5666695/Are-the-Greens-becoming-astroturfers) has posted more information about the Green Party's online activism system.

This is not cool. In fact, it's utterly disingenuous and really sucks. 

I (and the other mods) are happy for (any and all) political parties to have a presence on reddit - particularly as we lead up to an election. We're very happy that people want to chat about politics and things they care about. We're very very happy that we've had politicians do AMA's on the site. This is great, and part of what makes /r/nz great. 

HOWEVER, these drive-by posts pimping the Green Party are one very small step above spamming. These will be removed and the people doing it will be banned when we find them. I've already banned 3 accounts that I've spotted doing this. Note that we will *not* be banning anyone who expresses a political opinion - as long as you're an active member of the reddit community. If you're here to gain ""stars"" on the Green Party website, then you're not welcome. 

Everyone else, if you spot any astro-turfing asshats, then report the comment or send one of the mods a message. Please don't report people who just disagree with you, or are fans of a political party you disagree with, but those who are just here to promote a viewpoint (e.g. they signed up today to post one comment that says ""political party A is great!"").

Oh - and, as always, before you vote, make an informed decision based on a careful look at policies and track-records, rather than relying on what some dude on reddit told you.

It's not like I can claim good diction as a flat-accented yorkshireman), we have had a wonderful stay. 

Pro's: Breathtaking scenery almost everywhere (you have so many mountains you could export half of them and still look magnificent), good weather, glorious beaches, wide open spaces (so much room, so few people), dolphins, abundant food ... there are more pro's than I could possibly list in one post. 

Con's: a bit more expensive than home for food and eating out; my inexperience at driving a barbecue makes me look silly (I'm sure one of the residence requirements is ownership of a barbecue and a licence to show you know how to use it); it's NOT a good place to think ""Ah, I have a quarter tank of diesel left, I'll be able to fill up in the next town"" (holy shit, a house and a bar qualifies the middle of nowhere as a town, having a garage does not); your flat white takes a bit of getting used to; and your residency requirements most likely do not include me :( - we really did not want to leave. 

Kiwi's - keep going as you are, your country is beautiful, and your people are great.

1327191385.0	oqtuz	I believe extraditing someone to the USA is wrong and in violation of the their human rights as well as NZ law. Here are some reasons I think we should cancel our extradition treaty with the USA.	ultra_violence	132	20	61	"* The US prisons are extremely substandard and corrupt - violation of human rights.

* The recent NDAA provisions mean that people can be held indefinitely without charge. This is a violation of human rights as per [Security of Person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_of_person#New_Zealand) and the NZ Bill of Rights.

* A potential prison sentence of 50+ years again again violates our Bill of Rights (again, Cruel and Unusual Punishment)

* Our extradition treaty was introduced I believe in the 1970s. That's about 40 years ago. NZ and the USA are very different today, and I believe this is a good reason to revise the treaty to modernise it (or cancel it!).

Discuss?

This venue sells alcohol on the premises - just like any bar or pub or cafe would and there are some serious implications that arise with this. It just seems like there is no host responsibility on behalf of Vector by forcing costumers to pay for such a necessity. Also, I would be completely okay with bringing my own water but as you may know those are confiscated at the door, and empty water bottles have no use since the tap water in the bathrooms are so hot. 

What about the people fainting in the mosh pits?? I small squirt of water every half an hour from a security guard five meters away barely helps with anything. 

I have talked to the Auckland City Council who directed me to NZ Liquor Licencing representative and he stated that there is nothing they could do about Vector since their licence is a ""Special Licence"" opposed to an ""On Licence"" like at a bar where free water is an absolute must. 

Could someone please explain this to me??"	t5_2qhma	True

Let’s say a lethal, virulent virus like Rage occurred in the UK. It would spread to continental Europe within days and there would be little or no barrier to it spreading across the entire Eurasian landmass. Let’s assume (due to close proximity) that is spreads through the Africa and the America’s within a matter of weeks with the death toll hits 99% after 3 months – leaving some 70 million people (holed up in mountain retreats and other zombie fortresses) alive in the rest of the world.  

Due to isolation, NZ entirely escapes infection. We can safely assume we’d completely shut our borders a few days after initial infection - no human traffic, no trade, no physical exchange in any way with any country. 

Let’s assume we remain shut for 5 years. 

On the five year anniversary of NZ being completely isolated from the rest of the world, what would realistically happen to our society?  What are the food supply, raw materials, medical, energy, transport implications of this?

We have family that have lived in NZ for over 20 years and absolutely love it. If the first trip goes well, we would plan additional trips with our ultimate goal being to move to NZ within 5 years. To that end our ""plan"" is to continue building up our business to either sell it before moving or take it with us (it is a bookkeeping and accounting business so it can be done remotely). 

While we know no place is perfect and everyone has their own opinion and perspective, it seems like everyone we talk to who has been to NZ loves it; all the Kiwis we've met seem like great people and almost everything we've researched sounds like it fits us almost to a T. We know from researching that the job market is one point of contention for many native kiwis but our plan is to have our own business that can actually provide some jobs to others in NZ (nothing huge but maybe 6-12 employees if things continue to progress as expected).

Some more about us: We have a very strong marriage but no children (we plan to adopt at some point). We will both be in our 40s by the time we move to NZ (if everything works out). While we both have large families, they are already spread out around the world so not being ""close"" to family is not an issue for us (appart from the family we already have in NZ). We understand that some expats find NZ too isolated from the rest of the world however the idea of being a bit removed actually appeals to us lol. We also tend to lean a bit liberal politically but really don't consider ourselves overly political people.

As such, we'd love to hear from both Americans who have made the jump and have become NZ citizens or those that tried and left or anyone else that cares to comment. Thank you so much for anyone who makes it through that wall of text and responds! :)


Edit #1: Grammar :P

Edit #2: Just to clarify, by ""isolated"" I meant in terms of traveling to and from NZ; definitely wasn't referring to the people or culture or anything of that nature. :)

Edit #3: Thank you all so much for the huge response! We weren't expecting nearly so much interest nor so much great information. It's getting near dinner time here and I have to be up early tomorrow so we won't be able to read/respond to everyone tonight (today) but I'll see about catching up tomorrow.

Whether it has been Votes for Woman, a five day working week, safe working conditions, maternity leave, environmental conservation, decreased air and water pollution, gay marriage, end of slavery, end of apartheid. 

I could go on and on for as long as I care to read my history books.

The people who drove those positive changes were seen as criminal and subversive elements by the powers that ruled when they grew up. They were harassed, imprisoned, some murdered, some tortured.

In the Bad Days of the Apartheid Bureau of State Security and the East German STASI, every factoid had to be recorded on paper from some informant, and filed by a clerk.

Creating and accessing that information was time consuming and costly.

We are now entering an era where far far more information will be continuously recorded, continuously drag netted, flagged in real time, instantly retrievable.

Unless the public agencies are visibly bound and audited to the direct interests of the public... this civilization will stagnate and regress.

No further progress is possible, and regression is inevitable.

We would hope that this technology will make us safer.

It won't.

For every Edward Snowden that leaks information for free and for the public good, there will be a darker players that sell the information for a very high fee.

Hey all, I just wanted to thank everyone on this reddit for the huge support I got when, a few months ago, my mum suffered a major stroke and you guys all helped me get from Sydney to NZ and from Wellington to Palmerston North. 

An awesome bunch of redditors offered to help out, especially Minirat who offered to give me a lift at midnight from Wellington to Palmy with less than 24 hours notice and brain_in_a_jar who gave me a lift straight to the hospital in no time flat, not expecting anything, out of the kindness of their own hearts. 

Others poured in with offers of help and well wishes and all that. It was overwhelming, withing 48 hours after I found out my mum might not be alive soon, I was there and holding her hand and...

She got better, she suffered a major stroke, the size of the bleed in her brain was about the size of an egg, in the middle of the right hemisphere. I stayed there for about two months or so, as she slowly recovered.

Around june she got out of hospital after three months, the last month in the Physio ward of Palmerston North Hospital (Everybody there deserves a huge shout out, the staff, doctors and people around were amazing. I am eternally greatful to them all.) 

She is back at home, and doing better all the time. She went from having very little chance of surviving, to thriving. 

Here are a few photos and vids from my time in NZ. Thank you everyone.

And, just to note, I am specifically referring to Pizza Hut. Someone may like to add in the comments if a similar thing is available at Domino's. 

If you, like myself, have been enjoying fruits of an insanely competitive pizza price war here is a way to get even more for free. All of the pizza's in the 'classics' range are $4.90 but seem a little sparse as far as toppings go compared to the more expensive ones. Fair game you might say, but wait just a second! If when selecting a pizza you click the 'change my toppings button' you are presented with a considerable selection of sauces and toppings which can be added for no extra cost to what is already on the pizza (you can select them all if you feel so inclined). The list of free extras is as follows:


**Free Sauces**

* Apricot Sauce

* BBQ Base

* BBQ Sauce

* Satay Base

* Satay Sauce

* Tomato Base


**Free Sprinkles**

* Cajun

* Chilli

* Garlic

* Lemon Pepper

* Oregano

* Parmesan

tl/dr: The are some great topping that can be added to $4.90 pizzas for no extra charge."	t5_2qhma	True

1. You will need a heat source from wood and rocks - the rocks are important in order to absorb the heat, so choose accordingly! You preferably want to choose larger stones.

2. Dig a hole space, not too deep, which will depend on how many ingredients your hangi will use and how many you are feeding, for example the whole whanau.

3. Light them pieces of wood, gets those rocks nice and hot. I would suggest using some gloves, I just use oven ones or some shed gloves. Now it is important to get this fire going for a few good hours, get them rocks hot enough, or your meat won't cook through.

4. Throw all your ingredients into a large wired tray or pot, depending if you want a boilup going too. I normally wrap my shit in tinfoil to seal in the flavour. If you want, you can season your meat before you chuck it in, more flavour the better. I don't normally peel my spuds, keeps more flavour. Other veges such as puha and watercress can just be washed quickly. Kumara for special occasions only. If you choose a meat, pork and chicken is the best in my experience. 

5. Remove the wood so the stones are left, throw the hot rocks into the hangi pit and lay the ingredients on top. This has to be done quick, so it's best to get some help.  Cover that delicious food up with some (wet) cloth, then lay some sacks and dirt on top to cover any edges (you want to trap that steam in). Cooking times do vary from time to time, usually takes from anywhere between 3 to 4 hours, even 5 hours.

My driveway is broken, my car will get damaged when I try to leave the house, which I no longer what to do. Where would I go anyway? Everything was in town.

I even miss the bus stopping outside my flat every half hour, I miss that sound. Now when I hear a rumble, it's not a bus, it's an aftershock. The adrenaline shoots uncontrollably up the back of my legs and into my heart. It skips and thuds and I panic. I don't want to, it's an involuntary reaction. I am getting very annoyed that I can't 'get used to it'.

My ranch slider no longer locks and is hard to open. But I'm lucky; my house is still upright and liveable. No one I know died. I should be thankful, but I feel guilty for feeling 'affected'. My lot really isn't that bad in the bigger scheme of things but I shouldn't have to deal with this and I shouldn't have to compare myself to other people’s plights.

The G Forces on the day at my house were 188% of G. Imagine turbulence on a plane, that sinking feeling in your stomach that happened to me on my hallway stairs as I was thrown down them leaving a mark on the wall from my cardigan and spraining my ankle. I found a coat hanger with the plastic hook snapped off and the clothes and rest of hanger on the floor, the G forces did that.

I have broken things I don't want to replace, because really, why bother, they're just things. I miss the clock on the kitchen wall, I never realised how much I looked at it until it was gone. I can't be bothered to go get another cheap clock. I did all my shopping in town and the local mall. They're both cordoned off. I don't want to drive to the other side of town, it seems an extremely large hassle to do that for a $10 plastic clock and I don't like leaving the house. I know it's safe here, it's been tested by a 7.1 and 6.3 in 6 months, I was home both times, I can't guarantee anywhere outside of my house is safe.

I've started tidying and cleaning. Piling things to donate, I can't even be bothered listing anything on TradeMe. Things no longer seem important, my Ikea TV cabinet is a weight around my neck, I used to love that thing! They don't sell Ikea in NZ and I managed to buy if off someone who had moved to NZ from the UK and no longer needed it. Now that seems materialistic and sad.

It's only a small piece of land on a small island in a small country at the bottom of the world. But it was my small piece of land and now it's been stomped on and it'll never be the same again.

Until yesterday there were only two people active behind the event, with myself and another just volunteering to make four.


If you've got protest experience, have organised events in the past, or are just keen to throw in some ideas for slogans, what to do on the day or how to spread the word: we want you! Message us ASAP via the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=201024813275937), PM me or email aucklandcopyrightprotest@gmail.com to get on board.


This is the first step to having the Copyright Amendment become THE key issue in the November election -- we're going to be meeting over the next 2 weeks to make sure it goes right.

I visited NZ in 2009, and had a lovely time touring the North and South Islands.  My particular favorite place was Opunake, which I hope to sometime return to, possibly long-term.  Around the time I was there (just after the 2008 financial collapse), news came out that Wall Street was handing out million dollar bonuses while main street Americans took on huge amounts of future debt to finance a massive bailout.

I discussed this troublesome news with a handful of Kiwis, and the response was, for the most part, the same:

They said ""We're a small nation that doesn't put up with much bullshit.  We know each other.  The guy collecting your garbage may have a sister in parliament. If they pulled that shit here, we'd go after them with pitchforks.""

I'm not condoning violence, nor am I recommending any sort of armed rebellion, but I sure as shit hope you guys don't go the way us yanks did, which is bitching about it on reddit and facebook instead of actually DOING SOMETHING about it.
