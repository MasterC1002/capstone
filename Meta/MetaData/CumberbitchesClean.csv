1358629222.0	16w6bl	Friendly reminder, since we have a lot of new subscribers: any version of the .gif/video of Benedict dancing Thriller at a wedding will be removed. Please upvote for visibility.	tone_is_everything	129	11	4	"*tone: friendly, informative*

Don't worry, I'm not singling anyone out by any means; this has been posted several times recently, hence this post.

The reason that .gif/video will be removed is because it was originally stolen from Benedict's then-girlfriend's Facebook page. It was set to private but someone hacked her account and posted it on the web. Last I heard, they were seeking legal action against the hacker, but I don't know if there was any resolution.

While obviously we can't keep it from spreading around the web, we are trying to do our part and respect Ben's privacy by keeping it off our lil' subreddit.

This is in the sidebar, and includes a link to Olivia's (Benedict's then-girlfriend) post on YouTube about it.

*tone: friendly, encouraging*

This is our one and only subreddit rule (aside from the implicit ""only post relevant content""), so don't fret about posting anything else. In fact, spam us with all things Benedict, to your heart's content!"	t5_2tb11	True

1368495916.0	1eabl0	[Mod Post - please upvote for visibility] We have received a few requests to change the name of the subreddit, based on a comment Benedict made recently. This thread explains why things are staying as they are, with implicit apologies to those who feel strongly about a change.	tone_is_everything	114	8	15	"*tone: friendly, informative*

People keep bringing this up, so I'm making this post. Please do not continue to create threads or PM the mods about this; they will be deleted. Leave any/all comments in this thread (but please keep comments respectful, regardless of the view you want to express).

Recently, Benedict voiced being a little uncomfortable with saying the term ""Cumberbitches"" on TV. Many people are citing this to insist he hates the name, and we should rename ourselves because of this.

In fairness, he has used the term several times before. Personally, I believe he felt uncomfortable saying ""bitch"" on TV because he has a pretty clean, humble image. But regardless of anyone's interpretation of his feelings...

* **The term is the official name for his fans.** People who go to any community (Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook, etc) and look for other fans of the man, will search for the term ""Cumberbitch."" It's good to keep that name so more people can find us and join in the appreciation of the man.

* **It's not meant to be derogatory or exclusionary.** It was meant to be a silly play-on-words (it only changes one letter of his last name), and somewhat ""reclaiming"" the word *bitch* (like how a lot of women are reclaiming the word *slut* to mean someone who's sexually open, instead of an insulting word). I understand the criticism that the term excludes men; while I agree that interpretation is common, I hope men will forgive the term (see point 1) and join in the love.

* Lastly, and most importantly: **subreddit names cannot be changed**. We can't rename the sub, and it's not feasible to convince over 4,000 subscribers to switch, en masse, to a new subreddit. Plus, a lot of time and effort has been put into constructing this community, advertising for it (in other subreddits, to garner attention; and PMing mods to get them to add us to their sidebars), and especially in the art and design of the place. I would feel terrible if we abandoned all of that over a comment Benedict made.

This subreddit is the home of his fans, and it will remain as it is, with implicit apologies to anyone who feels strongly about the name. Thanks for your time and understanding."	t5_2tb11	True

1373462106.0	1i06xf	[MOD POST] Please tag spoiler posts and comments about Sherlock season 3! [please upvote for visibility]	tone_is_everything	111	18	2	"*tone: friendly, diplomatic*

Pictures from the filming of Sherlock season 3 *are* allowed in this subreddit, but only if they are flagged as such. Some people do not want to see any of these pictures, and we want to respect their choice in the matter. This rule will remain in effect until at least a couple weeks after that season premieres in the U.S. (which won't be til [early 2014](http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/03/sherlock-comic-con/)).

If you submit a link/post/picture that contains any potential spoilers for the new season, **please use the Link Flair to tag it as [SPOILERS]**. You can see the option for ""flair"" directly under your post (where you click to see the comments, edit your post, etc. -- it is the last option). **Please also mark any spoiler posts as NSFW** (the option just before the flair). This is pretty standard across reddit, because the default for [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) is to *not* auto-expand NSFW images, so it tends to help ""hide"" those images for people who don't want to see them. So in general, if you see a post that's NSFW, pay attention to the title (or any tagged link flair) before clicking on it, if you don't want to see spoilers.

**For comments, use the spoiler tags**. They work like this: \[Spoiler-y text](/spoiler) It will show up like this: [Spoiler-y text](/spoiler) (Hover your cursor over it to read it.)

If you can't remember one/both of these things down the road, just look over at the sidebar which will give you the same information. ---&gt;

*tone: friendly, reassuring*

No worries if anyone wasn't super-adherent to this policy in the past.

*tone: friendly, diplomatic*

But going forward, we are going to be fairly strict about this. If a post or comment containing spoilers is found and not tagged, **it will be removed** until it is properly tagged. Also, **please report any non-tagged spoiler posts or comments you see** to help the mods tag or remove them more quickly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!"	t5_2tb11	True

Seriously, as the tone says, I'm smashed. And I'm totally abusing my mod privileges to say: you people are freakin' fantastic. It has been my utter and absolute honor to mod this subreddit for the better part of a year. (Seriously, it brings a tear to my eye to think about that honor.) I love each and every one of you. **Yes**, that includes the lurkers and the randoms who are infrequent to our little commune. If you have clicked, visited, and/or voted, I love you.

I have made lasting friendships from here, and I am looking to cement growing friendships in the coming months. (You know who you are, you awesome people, you! Seriously, we need to get together for drinks, and/or continue messaging each other just to say hi!) This is *easily* my favorite subreddit.

No one cares if things are reposted. In fact, we love it! Everything is upvoted and everything is celebrated. Can you imagine if the rest of the world were like that? ""Holy crap, you said hello to me today! You are **fantastic**! Hello to you, too!!"" The world would be a better place. We set the tone (*tone: silly* Heh!) of that here by celebrating every post, and commenting accordingly. We have such an amazing, positive subreddit. Even if we disagree on minor points, people still comment, upvote, and remain civil. We are a fantastic group of humans, banding together under a common interest. But what makes us awesome is our community.

We are a phenomenal group of women and men (and possibly undecideds!). We're here because we adore a certain man, but we stay because we are: smart, creative, insightful, observant, introspective, passionate, appreciative, adventurous (to varying degrees), calm, thoughtful, loving, caring, talented, empathetic, brilliant, devoted, compassionate, silly, playful, witty, and dorky. **We are a fantastic group of people.** And *you* are part of that!

Most of us may not officially know most of the other subscribers. But in essence, we do. Our man Benedict attracts a certain type of person, and those people tend to get along with each other, because we are all amazing. We have created a fantastic fanbase just based on a mutual interest -- but we are all incredible human beings.

You. Are. Awesome.

You make this subreddit what it is. You are the reason I check it, first thing in the morning, and last thing before I go to bed at night. You are the main reason I come to Reddit. You. Are. Awesome.

*tone: extremely appreciative (and still smashed)*

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being who you are. You make the world go 'round, you make the stars come out at night, and you put the smile on my face. I love all of you. Keep on bein' awesome, and you will eternally have my thanks. Much love to all of you."	t5_2tb11	True
