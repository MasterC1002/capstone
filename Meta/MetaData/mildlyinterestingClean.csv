As a result of feedback we have received, a discussion thread, and further feedback via mod mail we have decided to implement the following rule on a 21 day trial basis. For photographs and picture submissions:

&gt;The title must simply describe what is in the image, without any jokes.

This rule is to keep submissions within the ethos of our subreddit. Recently, it has shifted towards a place for people to post content traditionally submitted to /r/funny. While the content is original, it is presented as a joke. That's not what this subreddit is for. If you think you're being funny, post to /r/funny. If you're simply stating what is in the photograph without any jokes, that is perfectly fine.

Feel free to discuss this below and how you feel this may affect the quality of our subreddit. The rules rarely change but when they do the overall quality of our content seems to get better, and subscriptions seem to steadily increase. We think we're doing it right but let us know in this thread!

Enjoy!"	t5_2ti4h	True
