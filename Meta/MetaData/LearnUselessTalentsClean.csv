Ever wanted to fart for some weird reason, but you didn't have anything to push out? Well, have no fear, because you can actually make yourself fart!

1. Get down on your hands and knees

2. Stick your butt up in the air, and lay your head on the floor

3. Suck in your chest to make yourself look skinny

4. If you have a tight butthole, spread your cheeks apart

After lying in this position for a few seconds, you should feel a sensation of air flowing into your ass. It may sound like a balloon being blown up, a reverse fart, or may not even make a sound. This air can be pushed back out--as a fart.

Congratulations! You can now fart on command! Use your new talent to get laid, express your love for your wife, or to ward away annoying people. The farts normally don't stink, either, so fart away!

Holy shit, I need to get a life.

EDIT: This probably will not work if you are wearing thick pants/jeans. This this in your underwear or sweatpants, or even naked, just don't shart all over your carpet.

1352136588.0	12ochy	How To Perform Circular Breathing	squarebase	1043	200	74	"I saw someone post about this in the request thread, so here goes! I taught myself back when I played trombone and now it is a talent that is essentially useless (although I can manually cool down food faster than the average human, if that counts).

In order to perform circular breathing you must first understand what you are doing. Circular breathing is performed by pushing out the air stored in your cheeks while simultaneously breathing in through your nose, which, if done correctly and seamlessly, will send a constant uninterrupted stream of air through your mouth. It is simple but takes practice.

You may want to harvest this talent for an instrument but begin practicing using only your mouth. 

**Make sure your mouth isn't open too wide.** Remember, the air you push out through your cheeks must have the same flow rate as the air you are dispelling through your lungs. Your mouth should be open about the same amount as if you were whistling.

1. Begin by exhaling as you normally would. Don't exhale too slowly or too quickly. As you are exhaling, slowly allow your mouth to fill up with air so that your cheeks become visibly bloated.

2. As the air in your lungs starts to run out, make sure your cheeks are properly ""puffed up"". Close off the air pathway from your lungs to your mouth using your tongue, which will open the pathway from your lungs to your nose (sorry, I do not know the correct way to phrase this...if this is confusing, think about how your tongue is positioned in your mouth when you blow your nose, or when you try to sniff something. The back of your tongue should be up against the back part of the roof of your mouth). 

3. Once opening the pathway to your nose, slowly breathe in through your nose. No air should be dispelled through the nose. Upon doing so, you will begin to push the air out of your mouth using the muscles in your cheeks. If you keep the same tight opening in your mouth, this shouldn't be too hard. If done correctly, the transition between exhaling with the lungs and exhaling with the air in your mouth should be seamless. **Note:** this step takes practice. The time that you have to inhale through the nose is limited, since there is only a certain amount of air stored in the cheeks. Practice adjusting the flow rate of air to help give you some extra inhaling time (ie slightly tightening the mouth opening as to decrease the amount of air needed to keep the same flow rate, therefore conserving the air a bit more).

4. This is the most difficult step in my opinion, and took the most practice for me. Once you have refilled your lungs with air, you will need to perform the reverse of step 2. Remove your tongue from the back/roof of your mouth; this will re-open the pathway between your lungs and your mouth. Once you have done so, exhale so that the air in your lungs enters your mouth from the back, ""meeting up"" with what little remaining air you still have stored in your mouth and therefore replenishing the air in your mouth. Now your airflow will continue, using the air in your lungs, as it originally was. You are now back to step 1 so remember to store some of this air in your mouth again. 

This final step is difficult because the transition must, again, be seamless. You must learn to match the flow rate of pushing air out of your mouth with the flow rate of exhaling through the lungs. The hardest part is learning to move your tongue from the back of your mouth without causing any ""bumps"" in the airflow. 

Once you have mastered steps 1-4, practice with an instrument! I taught myself circular breathing because I played the trombone and thought it would come in handy (which is not as true as it may seem, unfortunately) and once mastering the first 4 steps it was easy to incorporate the ""buzzing"" that brass instrument players must do while playing. 

Just something to note: the only air that flows through the nasal passage is air that you are **inhaling**, and the only air that flows through the mouth is air that you are **exhaling**. 

Hope this helps some people!

My method is to 'clap' it to death.  Slowly reach out your hands, one either side of the fly and about 3 inches above it, clap your hands together.  The fly will get spooked and go directly into your clap trap and get squished.   It has no escape; it can't go left or right without death, and by going upward, it goes into death as well! Win/win.

If you feel bad killing an innocent fly (why?), cup your hands when you clap.  It will just hold the fly in place, 'til you can chuck it outside."	t5_2u8qf	True

Then tell her that you are going to write down a prediction number (pick a number between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000. The number doesn't matter). Let her hold onto the prediction number but to not look at it.

Tell her to follow these instructions:

1. Type out the first 3 numbers of her phone number.

2. Multiply it by 80

3. Add 1

4. Multiply by 250

5. Add the last 4 numbers.

6. Add the last 4 numbers again.

7. Subtract 250.

Tell her to look at the prediction number and when she says it isn't correct ask her to see her phone and the paper. Stall her by making jokes and act like you messed up. While you are doing that, simply divide the number on her calculator by 2 and you will be left with her 7 digit phone number. Enter that number on your phone and call it.

Set the phone on the table in front of her and it should start ringing. Amazement ensues."	t5_2u8qf	True

The memorization is the hard part.

Each month has a value:

January - 3

February - 6

March - 6

April - 2

May - 4

June - 0

July - 2

August - 5

September - 1

October - 3

November - 6

December - 1



Each century has a value:

1700s - 2

1800s - 0

1900s - 5

2000s - 4

2100s - 2



Now for the calculation. We'll use the example May 23, 1990:

1) Take the last two digits of the year (ex. 90)

2) Divide the number by 4, discard the remainder, and add it to the previous number (ex. 90/4 = 22 + 90 = 112)

3) Add the century value to the running total (ex. 112 + 5 = 117)

4) Add the month value to the running total (ex. 117 + 4 = 121)

5) Add the date to the current value (ex. 121 + 23 = 144)

6) Take the result, divide by 7 (you'll learn the multiple of 7 pretty quickly) and find the remainder (ex. 144/7 = 20 with a remainder of 4)

7) Use the remainder to find the day of the week:


Sunday - 1

Monday - 2

Tuesday - 3

Wednesday - 4

Thursday - 5

Friday - 6

Saturday - 0

1363483616.0	1afvj9	My method on how to memorize digits of pi using palindromic patterns	RockofStrength	545	146	85	"Here is a sample of the method:  
3.1415 926 5358979 323 8462643 383

This concept takes the idea of palindromes more loosely, allowing for any pattern around the central digit.

3.1415 - ""4"" in center, surrounded by ""1""s, moving contrarily outside  
926 - ""2"" in center, ""9"" at left, upside down ""9"" at right (=""6"")  
5358979 - ""8"" in center, same pattern surrounds it  
323 - obvious  
8462643 - kind of forced, but it works. ""3"" is like an ""8"" with a bit erased.  
383

So basically, you memorize pi in pattern chunks, which helps with memory. A nice rule to have is that every digit must be a part of some larger pattern. I didn't even try to memorize these particular digits (I was more interested in the method than the practice), but I still can recall them days later, so it works.

EDIT: More digits!  
2 7950 2 = 79 is very spicy, 50 is very bland  
88 4 19 = 1 - 9 = 8 to relate the wings  
7 169 3 993 7 = ""7""s surrounding multiples of 3 (3 in center) (and a ""1""!)  
5 10 5 = ""5 10 5"" palindrome  
82 0 97 = 0 in the center, 8x2 = 16 and 9+7 = 16 (kinda forced)  
494 = obvious  
4 5923 0 7816 4 = Digits 1-9 surrounded by 4's, special digit in the center (""0"")  
062 8 620 = ""0 62 8 62 0"" palindrome  
8 99 8 = obvious

Being able to throw and hit a target from any random distance (as seen in many movies/tv shows) is bullshit. Being able to hit a target depends on how many times the knife rotates while in the air versus how far away the knife is from the target. 

For example, if it took 6 feet for a knife to make 1 full rotation, holding the opposite end of the knife and standing at 3 or 9 feet would theoretically work. 

Secondly, the best knives to throw are knives that have a line of symmetry down the middle of the knife, but any knife that isn't too asymmetrical should work. [Here](http://www.knifethrowing.info/how_to_throw_knives.html) is a good website on how to hold and throw the knives, for reference."	t5_2u8qf	True

Specifically, your index, middle, and ring fingers. Each is separated into three digits. Now going down, label them 1-7, which correspond to Monday through Sunday, so that the top digit on your index is 1, the middle of your index is 2, the bottom index is 3, top of your middle is 4 and so on. Now, remember this sequence (you can sort of 'type' it out with your thumb), 1, 4, 4, 7, 2, 5, 7, 3, 6, 1, 4, 6. This links to January through December. Note that I didn't memorise it this way, as long as you can remember that order on your fingers, you're good. Now, say you want to know 16 October. What you do is you go to your October digit (1), move one digit after (for Sundays it becomes Monday), in this case, it will be digit 2, and this will be 1st of October. From here it's pretty simple. If you want to skip a week, obviously it will be on the same date, so 1st October, a week later, 8th October, a week later, 15th October. Then, just move another down. You will find 16th October is a Wednesday. I know it sounds a little confusing, but once you get used to it, you can calculate any date within ten seconds. 

NOTE: You can rearrange the digit for other years, but also note that the config will be the same as 2013 for the years 1974, 1985, 1991, 2002, 2019, any year that started with a Tuesday unless its a leap year.

SECOND NOTE: I know moving one down after getting to the digit is a bit strange since you can just configure it so that the digit you are on is the 1st of that month, but I learnt it that way and I don't want to have to unlearn and relearn the method, but if you want, you can."	t5_2u8qf	True

1353469534.0	13jqo5	My guide to lucid dreaming	RothKyle	333	40	145	"First of all, this was originally my comment in the latest Request Thread. The thread can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/13exf7/weekly_request_thread_post_any_and_all_requests/). 

Secondly, for those of you who don't know, lucid dreaming is when you are asleep, within a dream, and you actually come to the realization that you aren't awake, allowing you to control ""reality"" and the things going on around you, not to mention the ability to do whatever the fuck you want because there are no consequences. It is not easy. It is VERY difficult and takes a long time to master. 

I have been lucid dreaming since I was in Jr. High (Grade 6-8). I've gotten so good at it that I don't even need to try anymore. Here are some things that I want to put extra emphasis on before I begin with tips on how to lucid dream.

1) When you first start lucid dreaming, you have about a 75% chance of having sleep paralysis at **least** a few times. For those of you who don't know, your body releases a chemical when you fall asleep. This chemical basically ""halts' your brain's control over your muscles so that you don't act out what you are doing in your sleep (sleep walking is when your brain does not secrete enough of this chemical, I think).

When you lucid dream, your body is basically confused on whether or not you are asleep or dreaming, and this may result in you waking up before your brain realizes you are awake. This is called sleep paralysis. Basically, you will wake up, feel a huge weight on your chest, you won't be able to move or talk, but you WILL be awake. Your brain simply won't realize it. You will begin to panic, even though you may know exactly what is going on. You will hallucinate very VERY strange things. Scary things. You have to accept that this may happen if you attempt to lucid dream. If you want to know more about what happens in sleep paralysis, let me know.

2) Lucid dreaming does not happen over night. It takes weeks, even months of constant practice to get it right. You need to be patient.
Now, knowing these two points, trust me when I say it is very much so worth going through the trouble. You can have sex with whoever you want. You can live the life of whomever you want. It's like being entered into Rekall, but...minus all the killing and secret agent confusion shit...unless that's what you want to dream about.

**HERE ARE THE TIPS ON HOW TO LUCID DREAM.**

1) Keep a dream journal. Every morning, the second you wake up, write down your dream. Don't simply write a summary of what happened, write EVERYTHING. Did you recognize your location? Were there any familiar faces? Did you feel any emotions within your dream? Any pain? Anguish? Happiness? What were the events that took place? Why did they happen? How did they happen? How long do you think the dream was? etc. etc. etc.

2) This one takes a lot more committment, but it is what worked for me. (I didn't do the dream journal, only this one. I have heard from many reliable sources that the dream journal helps, though.) Using a sharpie, draw two small dots on the back of each of your hands. Throughout the day, start picking out ""markers"". These markers can be anything you want, but I will just share what I did. Every time I looked at the clock, I would check the dots on my hands. Every time I heard the word, ""Umm..,"" I checked the dots on my hands. Everytime I met a new person, I checked the dots on my hands. Just pick things that you know will happen frequently.

Here is what you do.

Say you decide to do it after you check the time. You look up, notice that it is 12:30 PM. Then you check the dots on your hands. After looking at the dots, look back up at the clock. In the real world, it will say 12:30 PM or maybe 12:31 PM. Normal, right? Well, doing this enough will make it engrained in your memory. It will become something that you naturally do, without even thinking about it. 

Eventually, you will begin doing it in your dreams. (In order for this to happen, you need to do this EVERY DAY for as long as it takes, as often as it takes). When you check the time in your dream and it says 12:30 PM. You will check the dots, thinking you are in real life. When you look back up at the clock, it will be different. It might have a completely different time, it might have numbers that don't exist, the clock might not even be there. This will allow you to know you are asleep. If you do this every time you meet a new person, looking back up at them, they will suddenly have a new face, or they will be an animal...or something. Who knows.

3) When falling asleep, lay flat on your back. Don't have any limbs touch any other part of your body. Actually feel the bed around you. Control your breathing. Feel the weight of your skin.

**DO. NOT. MOVE.**

After about five minutes of this, your brain will test to see if you are still awake. You will feel ""spiders"" crawling on your skin, your knee will suddenly be very uncomfortable, you will become very cold and all of a sudden need a blanket, etc. IGNORE THESE IMPULSES. It is really damn hard, but ignore them.

Ignoring them for about ten minutes will result in your brain ""shutting down"". You will suddenly feel a huge weight on your chest. You will hear things scattering around the room. You will see things. You have entered sleep paralysis. KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT. You do not want to open them. ~~It won't ""wake you up"", you simply don't want to see what is ""standing"" in front of you~~ (Read my edit at the bottom). Keep thinking to youself to go to sleep. Just keep repeating it to yourself over and over. Eventually, you will be somewhere completely different. Somewhere foreign. However, you will still feel the bed around you. This will indicate you are, in fact, asleep.

Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be more than willing to answer them. Obligatory /r/LucidDreaming shout out. It is a great subreddit with a fantastic community.

P.S - I'm too tired to proof read this. I apologize for any spelling errors or grammar mistakes. If something I said made absolutely no sense, let me know.

**TL;DR -** Want to have sex with Jessica Alba? Got someone you hate and want him/her killed? Feel like robbing a bank? Wanna visit Japan but have no money? THEN COME TO REKALL.....I mean...uhh...learn to lucid dream. 

**EDIT - VERY IMPORTANT NOTE** - It was not my intention to frighten people with the sleep paralysis thing. Apparently, it is abnormal to experience hallucinations while in paralysis. Credit to Perperplaplippleplop for this information.

1370351286.0	1fndks	How to calculate the offset between Julian and Gregorian calendars as far back as 200 AD	gmsc	350	77	9	"To start, you'll only need the century part of the given year, so you can simply ignore the rightmost two digits. For example, all you need from the year 1275 is 12, and all you need from the year 1983 is 19.

Using the variable *x* to refer to the century number, follow these steps:

1) Calculate 3x

2) If 3x happens to be a multiple of 4, use 3x in step 3. If 3x is NOT a multiple of 4, use the closest multiple of 4 that is GREATER than 3x.

3) Divide by 4.

4) Subtract 2.

The number you now have is how many days need to be added to a Julian date in the given year to get the corresponding Gregorian date. Conversely, it's also how many days need to be subtracted from a Gregorian date to get the corresponding Julian date.

---

**Example 1:** Given the Julian date December 25, 1642, what is the corresponding Gregorian date? 16 is the century, so we'll start from there.

1) 16 * 3 = 48

2) 48 is already a multiple of 4, so no adjustments are made at this point.

3) 48 / 4 = 12

4) 12 - 2 = 10

So, for the 1600s, we need to add 10 to the Julian date to get the corresponding Gregorian date. Thus, the Julian date of December 25, 1642 is the same as the Gregorian date of January 4, 1643.

**Example 2:** Given the Julian date of June 4, 1013, what is the Gregorian date? 10 is the century number we use this time.

1) 10 * 3 = 30

2) 30 is NOT a multiple of 4, so we use the closest multiple of 4 greater than 30, which is 32, in the next step.

3) 32 / 4 = 8

4) 8 - 2 = 6

6 is the number of days we need to add in the 1000s, so June 4, 1013 Julian is the same as June 10, 1013 Gregorian!

**Final example:** As I write this, today's date in the Gregorian calendar is June 4, 2013. What is it in the Julian calendar? By now you understand why we start with 20 for this example.

1) 20 * 3 = 60

2) 60 is already a multiple of 4, so no adjustments are made at this step.

3) 60 / 4 = 15

4) 15 - 2 = 13

13 days is the offset, so we subtract 13 days from the Gregorian date of June 4, 2013 (the subtraction is simpler if we treat June 4th as May ""35th"", and do 35 - 13 = 22) to get the Julian date of May 22nd, 2013.

With the above technique, it's not difficult to handle dates back to the year 200 AD, when the offset goes down to 0 (everything in the 200s is the same date in the Julian and Gregorian calendars). In dates before the year 200, you have to start working with negative adjustments, and there are further adjustments need to be made for BC dates.

---

One last important detail: EVERY year evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year in the Julian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, every year that's evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year, UNLESS it ends in 00. Gregorian years ending in 00 are only leap years if they're evenly divisible by 400.

So, 2000 is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, but 1900 and 2100 are not. In the Julian calendar, 1900, 2000, and 2100 are all leap years.

1344180817.0	xpte6	Learn to read binary.	Pwoshi	235	60	53	"This might be time consuming and I'm not the greatest teacher, but try to bear with me.

This is easier if you know the numbers of the alphabet. 

To start off, numbers start with 0011---- (thanks [davidrussell323](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/xpte6/learn_to_read_binary/c5ojbb5)), capitals have the base 010-----, and lower Case have the base 011-----

Basically just remember 1, 10, and 11.

As you go up you'll have to add the next multiple of 10, so:

1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111

So if you wanted to write a T, then that would be the 20th letter.

If you follow the order: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10011, and finally 10100, then you'll put it to the capital base in place of the right five zeroes to look like this: 01010100.

Remember to add zeroes before the numbers if you have less than 5 total numbers.

Time consuming, and probably never useful, but then again you have yourself a secret language.

Edit: Crap, sorry everyone, but it needs to be 8 numbers long no matter what. It's probably too late now, but check out [this](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)."	t5_2u8qf	True

All you need is something tennis ball sized, can be anything really; screwed up toilet roll, couple of socks, anything roughly that size and shape.

First hide your chosen object in your armpit as high up as it will go so that it's out of sight, preferably under your shirt. 

Then get someone to feel your pulse on your wrist.

When they have your pulse tell them you are going to stop your pulse. For this, squeeze the ball against your body with your arm, without making the movement too obvious. This SHOULD stop your pulse on that arm. If it doesn't, use a bigger/harder ball.

To restart your pulse simply relax your arm again.

For best results make facial expressions as if you are concentrating all your energy into stopping your pulse/say mysterious magic shit.

That's all there is to it: as a little disclaimer I don't recommend stopping your pulse for more than a few seconds because it's probably not very good for you."	t5_2u8qf	True

*  Hold one finger at arms length in front of your eyes and focus on it.

*  Slowly move it to about 10"" from your face, still focusing on it.

*  Keeping your finger there, stop focusing on it and instead focus on an object in the distance.  Then go back to focusing on your finger.

*  Repeat this a couple times.  Each time you're focusing on your finger, you're crossing your eyes (albeit, not by that much) and each time you focus on the object in the distance you're uncrossing them.

* Once it feels easy to focus on your finger move it an inch or two closer to your face, and repeat the above two steps.

As you get more practice crossing and uncrossing your eyes to greater degrees, you will eventually get to the point where you can focus on your finger when it's right against your nose.  Once you can do that, you're completely crossing your eyes.  Now you just have to practice making the same motion with your eyes, but without having a finger there.

**[Useless Talent] - Getting Free Stickers**  
  
How I got into it: I bike a lot. And I have some cool equipment. But, like all teenagers, I wanted to make my equipment cooler. So I wondered why bikers couldn't get cool stickers like skateboarders/snowboarders to put on bikes, jackets etc... I was in the ""Whoah, Wtf!? I wouldn't even know where to buy stickers like that!"" category for a while. Then I found this url.  
  
http://www.bckcntry.com/?p=26  
  
If you send companies a nice note *with a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope, or SASE for short*, companies are generally happy to give out a low quantity of high quality stickers because it is great brand representation and promotion. These stickers generally look awesome, so it's a good way to spice up some bland spots on laptops and equipment (and wherever).
  
To show you how this is done and give you an example: here's what I did my first batch of outgoing mail.
  
This is my first attempt:  
  
**Step 1: Research**
  
Since most of the companies listed in the link are *snowboarding* companies, I decided to do a little research and get the addresses of major biking companies. Here are the addresses I sent to.  
  
http://imgur.com/c6IKJ  

Some of them I picked just for kicks to see what would happen. I used some snowboarding companies that he used because I know that they would probably respond. Most of the rest of them had to do with the fact that they were major biking companies.  
  
**Step 2: Creating Envelopes**  
  
http://imgur.com/UOIIB,HJhIW,hwvas#0  
  
Now I noticed that at the original source there were all sorts of questions as to ""How many stamps?"", ""What kind of Envelopes?"" and ""Is it okay to fold a SASE into another envelope?"" I'll get to all of these questions.   
  
For now, you are going to need 2 envelopes for every company you want to get stickers from. Standard white rectangular envelopes that you can pick up at almost any retail store work great. Now address one of each to a company. It works better if you use a computer and printer (as I have done in the example), or a typewriter because it looks more professional. Pages for Mac makes some great looking envelopes. Feel free to handwrite however. Anything works-as long as the post office can read it. Put a return address on all of them, then make sure that you stamp all of them. One stamp per envelope is fine.  
  
Now do all of those steps for your second set of envelopes, just reversing the send and return addresses. Again one stamp is fine. *Make sure to stamp your return envelopes.* If you don't, you probably won't get anything. Time for...  
  
**Step Three: The Message**  
  
Now the point is to get stickers. Don't get too fancy. A simple message like...:  
  
 “Hi (company your mailing),
I love your brand, and was wondering if you guys
could mail me some stickers so I can represent your stuff?
Keep up the great work!
-(Your Name)” [Original Source](http://www.bckcntry.com/?p=26)
  
...works fine. Feel free to personalize it, though. You want to be sincere, not robotic. I try to be funny, so sometimes I will throw something in: ""I would just draw your logo on stuff, but I'm a horrible artist and it might turn out so bad that it makes people go blind just by looking at it. Any help?""  
  
**Step Four: Seal the Deal**
  
Making sure you have all of the envelopes and messages with their matching company, put the message and the return envelope in the outgoing envelope and seal it. Fold the return envelope to make it fit in the outgoing envelope. It really doesn't matter how. Then put it in the mail and mail it.  
  
**Step Five: Wait**
  
It can take up to a month and a half to get everything back. Depending on your proximity to the company, you will get some back quickly. 

Here is a sample of my results.
  
http://imgur.com/9OBZn  

http://imgur.com/a/3AYUQ
  
**Step Six: Post Stickers**  
  
Well, now that you have some, USE THEM!! Put them in places people will see them!  
  
**If you have done this before, or try it and get results, post something as a reply**



**Tips:**  
  
*When writing to companies, make sure that you have the right address.

*You can use yellow envelopes that are larger. Sometimes it gets you more/bigger stickers. Sometimes not. They still only need 1 forever stamp.

*Don't feel bad if you don't get 100% return. I got about 75% (and I haven't posted very much of what I've gotten). 

*Don't feel bad if you get lots of wrong addresses. I am constantly getting returns.

*If you want a return, send lots at once. 

*I would give out free stickers, but I wouldn't have enough for everyone. I might do trades though.

**Tl,dr: Asking for stickers from companies by mail generally results in free stickers**

1. Sit down, preferably somewhere close to a surface around lower-chest level
2. Take your left hand (opposite of the elbow you want to lick) and put your right elbow in an ""arm wresting"" position on top of said hand.
3. Tilt AND turn your head to the left. (Basically stretching the right side of your neck as much as possible)
4. Without unstretching your neck bring it down right next to your elbow.
5. You should be close enough to extend your tongue to lick it.

I might post a video as these instructions probably don't make sense to anyone.

Note: I do not have a ""long tongue."" I am not ""double-jointed"" or too flexible. My body is fairly normal in lengths. I am a firm believer that a majority of people can do this but just don't know how.

1347111944.0	zjzdx	How to multiply two numbers such as 84 and 86, or 63 and 67, 234 and 236, etc.	thisnameisnttakenyet	160	45	24	"Along the same vein of [squaring anything ends in a 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/z07ma/how_to_square_any_number_that_ends_in_a_5/), this is what I consider a more general form of that trick. For this to work, the two numbers need to:

1. be identical from the tens digit onward (i.e. 63 &amp; 67, 234 &amp; 236, etc.)
2. their singles digit has to add up to 10 (i.e. for 63 and 67, 3+7=10)

The procedure is almost identical to squaring numbers ending with 5:

1. Take all the digits from the tens digit onwards--they should be the same for both numbers you are multiplying! (multiplying 63 and 67-----&gt;6, multiplying 234 &amp; 236----&gt; 23)

2. multiply with itself +1 (aka next larger consecutive number, 23 would mean 23x(23+1)=23x24)

3. add the product of the two singles digit to the end (234x236 would mean to add 4x6=24 at the end)

example: 234x236= 
1.23x24=552
2. 4x6=24
answer:55224

63x67
1. 6x7=42
2. 3x7=21
answer:4221

Basically it is exactly the same as squaring two numbers ending in 5. Realize that the 25 at the end is from 5x5, thus if the ending are 4 and 6, then it's 24, and if it's 3 and 7, then 21, and so on.



TL;DR: do everything you would do for squaring two numbers ending with 5, but change the last step to the product of the singles digit of the two numbers you're multiplying instead of 25"	t5_2u8qf	True

We've reached 100,000 talented Redditors and we obviously couldn't have kept this subreddit as amazing as it is without all of you. We're a great community, let's keep it that way. 

Now, something that needs to be addressed. With the big influxes of new users, there have been quite a few rule breakers. Nothing huge, but just something that the mods feel we all need to be reminded of. 

1) Rule number 2 in the sidebar. Ever since the request threads have been created, I receive a ridiculous amount of PMs on a weekly basis about how the requests aren't all useless. It's okay. What someone might consider useful, many others may feel that the talent is completely useless. It's all subjective. Please do not complain whether or not a talent is useless. 

2) Rule number 6. ""Requests are cool, but as of August 30th, 2012 at 10:22 PM they MUST be posted in the official Request threads. Do not make a post just for a request. Keep our page clean of [request] clutter.""

This rule was put in place for that reason specifically, we do not want the front page cluttered with requests. I had to remove three posts the other day, that had hit the front page, because they were requests. Removing highly upvoted posts is something that I really hate to do. So let's just keep the requests to the request threads that are posted every Sunday, like this one. 

Again, thank you all. Every single one of you is fantastic. 

On that note (sorry for the Mod rant), this is the newest request thread. The past few haven't gotten much traction, so let's make this one take off. 

Have a request? Post it here. Don't have a request? Browse this thread to see if you can help out other Redditor's requests.

So you start out with the bottom middle hole empty. The first step is to take the middle peg of the right side, and jump it into this bottom middle hole, thus removing the peg it jumped (Pictures 1 and 2). Next, you take the middle peg from the left side and jump it over to the right middle hole (Picture 3.) Next, in pictures 4 and 5, have the bottom left 2 pegs, (bottom left corner and the one next to it) jump up so they're in the middle row. Next, take the peg that's one down and to the left of the top peg, and jump it over the left middle peg (Picture 6.) Next, take the peg that's one down and to the right of the top peg, and jump it down and to the left of the middle peg (Picture 7). Next, take the peg that's on the right end, up one from the bottom right corner, and jump it up that edge so it's one below and to the right of the top peg (Picture 8.) Then jump the top peg down and to the right over that peg (Picture 9.) Then take the peg on the bottom row second from the right  and jump it to the left over the middle peg in that row. Next take the left-most peg and jump it to the right. Then take the middle peg of the right row and jump it down and to the left. Then take the left-most peg and jump it right. Then take the right-most peg and jump it left. And you're done!!!!!!!!!

1349917626.0	11a8sr	How to quickly figure out what day of the week a date falls on	GregOttawa	105	19	11	"The key to this is simple preparation and a bit of arithmetic. For any given month, all the multiples of 7 fall on the same day. I usually have memorized what day that is for the current month and the next few months. So October (2012) is a ""Sunday month"" and November is a ""Wednesday month"" and December is a ""Friday month"". You only have to memorize a new one every month, and you only have to keep a few in your head at any time.

Now when somebody says, ""We should get together one Saturday. Say... November 9."" you can snap back with ""That's a Friday. Do you mean November 10?"" All you have to do is find the nearest multiple of 7 and work from there. So when they ask about November 9, that's close to November 7 - which must be a Wednesday (since November 2012 is a ""Wednesday month"").

If you have a few extra moments (like that useless time when other people are talking) you can even figure out future months if you don't know the day yet. So suppose you knew December was a Friday month, but didn't know January yet, you just add a few days based on how long December is (not how long January is). The number of days you add is the number of days in the known month - 28. December has 31 days, so add 3. So January is a Monday month (+3), February is a Thursday month (+3), March is also a Thursday Month (no leap year in 2013), April is a Sunday Month (+3). So April 26,2013 is a Friday.

This sounds like a long explanation, but when you know the system, the calculations are super easy. All you are doing is remembering a few weekdays for upcoming months, and then finding the nearest multiple of 7 to the date in question."	t5_2u8qf	True

3) Let the smoke slowly flow out of your mouth, don't exhale too fast and tap your cheek with your index finger repeatedly whilst the smoke is coming out.

1. With the paper upright, you align the upper (shorter) edge with the long edge, noting where the corner is on the longer side (further down)

2. Do that at the bottom as well (this time the corner will lie further up along the edge)

3. Make a fold in the paper above the upper mark parallel to the short edges, such that the edge is slightly above the mark after the fold. 

4. Do the same with the lower edge - here you're aiming to have the lower edge end up slightly below the mark.

5. The upper and lower sections of the paper marked by the folds are roughly 1/7 of the area of the paper. You can now continue to divide the paper up using these. 

You can also only make one fold and use that to divide the whole piece of paper, but I think you get slightly better results using two.

Method 1 (optimal):

1. ""Close"" both your nostrils and throat - that is to say, don't breathe.

2. Suck in with your throat; if done correctly, you should feel as if your throat is rising and air entering.

3. Optionally, if you want a longer burp, open your mouth and continue doing so, closing your throat while still ""inhaling"".

4. Probably the most obvious and easiest step if you've done the previous three correctly - burp.

Method 2:

1. Close your mouth; however, you can still breathe through your nose if you want.

2. Push air ""out"" from your throat while keeping your mouth closed.

3. Yeah, this again. Let it out. Duh.

Method 3:

1. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth.

2. Push air ""out"" from your throat while keeping your tongue on the roof of your mouth.

3. You know what to do.

Method 4 (most common):

1. Close your mouth and prepare as if you were about to swallow a large bite of food.

2. Continue to imagine doing so, and swallow the air partway down your throat. It's hard to explain.

3. You really shouldn't need instructions on what to do now.

Method 5 (similar to method 1):

1. Keep your mouth open but nose and back of your throat closed - in other words, don't breathe.

2. Suck in air; it's sorta hard to explain.

3. Close your mouth, and open it again and repeat the same process to make longer burps.

Method 6 (the first one I discovered):

1. Lean back your neck, opening your mouth wide enough as if you were yawning.

2. Instead of hearing the ""click"" in your ears, you should feel a bit of air going into your throat.

3. I seriously hope you're intelligent enough to know what to do.

If you can do these well enough then you can attempt to burp while talking.

*  Pick any 2-digit number (let's start with 47, for an example.  So we're going to mentally find 47 * 47)  
*  Find how much you would need to add or subtract to make this number a multiple of 10 (For 47, you need to add three.)  
*  Add this one-digit number to one of the identical two-digit numbers you're multiplying, and subtract it from the other (You were multiplying 47 * 47.  Add 3 to one of those 47s and subtract it from the other, so now we're multiplying (47+3)(47-3) = (50*44)  
*  Multiply them in your head, which should be easy since one is a multiple of ten. (50 x 44 = 10 x 5 x 44 = 10*220 = 2200).  
*  Take that single-digit number you found earlier, square it, and add it to the number you just multiplied (3^2 = 9.  9 + 2200 = 2209).

And that's it.  2209 is 47^2, and all those steps are ones which can be pretty easily done in your head.  This will work for any number (but it's harder for any number larger than 2 digits)

Why does it work?

Basically the equation you're using for x^2 is (x+b)(x-b) + b^2 (where b is the single-digit number you found).

(x+b)(x-b) + b^2 = (x^2 + xb - xb -b^2) + b^2  
(x^2 + xb - xb -b^2) + b^2 = x^2

And you're right.  But you may have also had trouble refilling that dispenser in a way that doesn't drip soap everywhere.

It happens to everyone; you push the opening of your refill jug together with the soap dispenser's neck perfectly, and the soap starts to flow.  But then it slows down to a trickle.  So what do you do?  You squeeze the jug to get it out faster, and that's when soap gets pushed out from your carefully-created seal and drips down your hands.  

The problem was that you squeezed the refill jug, the container on the top.  What you should have done is squeezed the container on the bottom.  Why, you ask?  As you pour soap from the refill jug into the dispenser, pressure is increasing in the dispenser and decreasing in the jug.  And fluids don't like to flow from a low-pressure system to a high-pressure system, so the soap doesn't pour as quickly.  When you squeeze the dispenser, what it does is push air into the refill jug, equalizing the pressure.  And after you let go again, you'll find the soap is flowing quickly once more without leaking out the sides.

TL;DR: Squeeze the container you're pouring soap into."	t5_2u8qf	True

1346366593.0	z3q8u	How to apply a screen protector to a smart phone without creating little air bubbles.		52	8	13	"I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/ypu0s/request_how_to_apply_a_screen_protector_to_a/) by /u/movieman1214 and thought I could help. I have worked for a wireless carrier for about a year, and have applied about 250-300 screen protectors. 

The application process really depends on the brand of screen protector, material it's made of, and whether or not it is a wet or dry application. The wet ones are definitely the easiest, however some people don't like any liquid getting near their expensive electronics, and I have found with certain brands (i.e. InvisibleShield) you might get some persistent residue underneath that doesn't go away, and which might distort the image on the screen. 

**Tips for both wet and dry applications**:

* **TAKE YOUR TIME**. This is not a process that should be rushed. Make sure you have at least 10 minutes of free time.

* Always spend at least 1 or 2 minutes cleaning the screen before application. I find the best way to do this is with the microfiber cloth that should have come with the protector, and a pea sized amount of hand sanitizer. If the phone has some persistant greasy smudges, you can also use a de-greaser such as Windex (**NEVER** spray any liquid directly on the device, always apply to the cloth). 

* The absolute best time to apply a screen protector is right after you get the phone. If you can leave the protective layer that shipped with the phone on until the last minute, you can ensure that no dust or finger prints will come into contact with the bare screen. (NOTE: these protective layers are not meant to be used as a permanent protector, they barely adhere to the screen, usually have text on them, and they will cover the in-call speaker and/or microphone, making calls difficult)

* A great way to get rid of any persistent dust on the screen is with a small loop of scotch tape. Wrap it around your fingers and lightly dab at the dust on the screen, it will come right off. If you have a can of compressed air or an electronic duster that works very good as well. One handy trick we have at my store is to have a second person standing by with compressed air, carefully watching if any dust settles on the screen while the other person aligns and applies the protector.

* If possible, apply screen protector in a bathroom with the shower running at full heat. If it is nice and humid in there, dust is less likely to settle on the screen during the application. Do not keep the device in the bathroom too long, however, because moisture can get inside the device and cause liquid damage.

* If possible, let the protector 'settle' for about 24 hours, with little to no usage. Do not put the phone in a case or pocket during this time, it can make the protector shift or detach while it is still adhering to the screen. Be careful with cases in general, especially ones that wrap around the front of the device (i.e. Otterbox Commuter and Defender, Case-mate POP). I have had cases push on the edge of my screen protector, causing it to lift from the screen.

* Most air bubbles are caused by dust between the screen and protector, but a lot of the time bubbles can appear from improper application. 

**For Wet Applications Only**:

* Turn off the device and remove the battery

* FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGING. Most of the application process for different wet screen protectors is the same, but you never know. Most suggest that you first spray the included application spray on freshly washed hands, so that you can touch the underside of the protector without leaving dirt or finger prints. Once again, **never spray the liquid directly on the device**, only on the screen protector. Some require you to spray the top and bottom of the protector, while some only need the bottom.

* Use a generous amount of spray. Too little will make it so that the protector won't glide on top of the screen, and makes lining it up a lot more difficult.

* As stated above, the main benefit of wet applications is that you are able to adjust the protector once you apply it to the screen. Take your time doing this, and make sure it lines up perfect with the screen, front camera, any buttons (especially the iPhone Home button) and any light sensors. 

* Once you have it lined up to your liking, you need to squeeze out the liquid from under the screen. Use the provided squeegee, but if you don't have it for some reason, a credit card or gift card with the microfiber cloth wrapped around it will work (Don't use the bare card, you risk scratching or scuffing the protector). The instructions will warn you to push the liquid away from buttons or the front speaker, which is a good tip, but don't worry too much about it, especially if you let it sit with the battery removed for a day. I like to start from the middle of the protector and push the liquid outwards. I find if you can do this while applying pressure with a fingertip in the middle, the protector will not shift. 

* Most manufacturers recommend keeping the battery out of the device for 24 to 48 hours after application, so keep that in mind.

**For Dry Applications Only:**

* Extra time and care must be used when lining up the protector for dry applications, as you cannot adjust it when it is stuck on the screen. 

* Depending on the phone and/or the protector, I usually use two different methods for the application. One way is to remove the entire backing on the adhesive side, hold it at each edge with both of your hands, and line it up. With this method, you have to be careful not to touch the adhesive, as you will get fingerprints and/or dust under the screen. The other way is to peel off one edge, bend the protective layer back, and line up and stick that edge on first. If it's lined up correctly, you can then slowly start peeling back the bottom layer, while running the squeegee along the top lightly. This method makes it easier to hold the protector without worrying about getting finger prints on it, but I have made mistakes lining it up this way, which resulted in a slightly off center protector.

* Once the protector is stuck to the screen, it is time to start squeegeeing out the bubbles. Start from the center and work your way outwards as above. Most dry protectors have an additional protective layer on top, so you can use quite a bit of force without worrying about scratching the actual protector. 

* Now is a good time to make sure there is no dust trapped under the screen. If there is, it is possible to remove it, but it is very difficult and may ruin the protector, so use discretion. If the dust is near the corner or sides of the screen protector, you can lightly peel off that edge, without touching the adhesive. Take another loop of tape, and lightly dab at the dust (it will most likely be attached to the protector, not the screen). Be very careful while doing this, as it is possible to get more dust under the protector. Once the dust is gone, reattach the rest of the protector.

* Once the bubbles are all gone, you will need to remove the top layer from the protector (if it has one). Be careful while doing this, as the protector may separate from the screen. The best way to do this is to carefully peel back one corner, then place a finger on the exposed corner of the protector and apply pressure while peeling the top layer off. If any bubbles are left over after the top layer is removed, don't use the squeegee directly on the protector. Lightly place the top layer over the bubble and use the squeegee to push out the bubble. 

Personally, I like to apply dry protectors, since I have had so much practice I have got very good at applying them. For wet protectors, I would recommend staying away from InvisibleShield, as they tend to get a yellow-ish tinge over time, and most of the ones I have applied had residue trapped inside, as I mentioned above (I haven't tried the new [InvisibleShield HD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dtAU7TWPjo&amp;feature=player_embedded) protectors yet, so I'm not sure if they are any different).

If this still seems overwhelming, as someone else mentioned on the other thread, a lot of places will apply a screen protector for you. [GhostArmor](http://www.ghost-armor.com/) is very good for this, as they charge only an extra $5 to apply a screen-only protector, and $10 for a full-body protector. They are also very high quality. Don't be afraid to ask the salesperson at BestBuy or wireless carrier stores, but don't be a dick about it and expect them to. Some people I work with refuse to put them on for fear of making mistakes, but I am always willing to help out. A surprising amount of people don't ask, but I usually offer to anyways. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone buys one from me, refuses my help to put it on, and spends about 30 seconds putting it on themselves in front of me. Most of the time they fuck it up, and then expect me to give them a discount on a new one.

If you get good at applying them and a friend asks you to do it, charge them. I think a good screen protector application is worth at least $5 or $10, but please don't fuck it up.

Sorry for the novel, but I was really bored and have a lot of good information about this. Any questions or clarifications needed? Please comment below, I'm happy to help.

3. Purse your lips into a whistle. Play with it until you get it right!

Extra credit: start working with both pitches and try variations. It's easiest to move both pitches in unison (often in octaves), but try moving them in opposite directions!

I wrote this in the comments of the request submission but figured I would give it its own self post since it will get seen more and I don't get any karma anyways! I know it is probably not better than a movie how to, but its from another Redditor so that means something...right? guys? right?




I was going to make a video, but then realized i dno how to do any editing and dont have a program. I'll type out my best though:  
  

How to spin a pencil!

Firstly, use a long pencil! A brand new one will be the best. Short ones are for the professionals only! You can also expirement with different weights (ie mechanical pencils, pens, or even rulers!)

You use your thumb, index and middle finger. Curl the other ones to get them out of the way. Or just cut them off, easier! [Like so](http://imgur.com/Gg2Gf)
  
The index finger is only there to hold the pencil in place.


Start near the very end of pencil. Just before the metally-eraser-holder part. [Like so](http://imgur.com/bQrGA)

Start learning to do this **slowly** and push the middle finger inwards towards the bottom of the thumb and point the index finger outwards to get it out of the way. You're middle finger stays in the position that it was in when you were holding the pencil. Because of this, you will catch the pencil on the top of the middle finger. See video above.


It should spin around your thumb and fall back into place. [Like so](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6901VCPQ_s)

When you catch it, you should be holding it about half way down the  pencil

If you get really good, you can spin it twice around! [As I attempt to teach you here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0awe-hpSatg). I get one that goes 1.5 times but then I gave up because getting it around twice doesn't happen very often. But you get the point.

Good luck!

Tommy_TSW	42	14	6	"So essentially, each value from the [4-Deck to 8-Deck Blackjack Strategy chart](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/) is assigned a fictional character from games that are familiar to me. I use the characters from Street Fighter for my own value and characters from Team Fortress 2 as the dealer's.

[Here is my hard hand reference chart](http://i.imgur.com/AE2lT.jpg).

I then recall a ""pre-fantasized"" little story involving the two characters, usually a fight between them, the result of which tells me what to do.

The numbers are Mnemonics for the character.

**Dealer has 9. There are 9 players on a baseball team.**

[Dealer has Scout](http://i.imgur.com/rS8o8.jpg).

**Player has 11. Eleven sounds like heaven.**

[Player has Oni](http://i.imgur.com/mNqhX.jpg).

The two characters are Mnemonics for the pre-thought story.
**""Oni and Scout run towards each other, samurai duel style. They run past each other. There is a moments pause. Both drop. DOUBLE KO.""**

The result of the battle (Double KO, player strikes dealers character, or characters are friendly to each other) is a mnemonic to double, hit or stand.

*Wait, don't tell me you've written down an individual story for each &amp; every possible action? Including soft hands &amp; splits?*

[Yes I have](http://i.imgur.com/QMbaK.jpg).

This is the power of imaginative memory. Think of a detailed enough story and it's locked into your head for good. Writing it down just helps hammer it in that little bit more, plus you can read over the stories occasionally as a refresher.

If you put in a solid days effort, assigning logical characters to each value (celebs, superheroes, friends)  and thinking up colorful/silly mnemonics, I'm positive you'll be able to recall the entire basic stradagy chart by the end of the same day."	t5_2u8qf	True

A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/ Gb, G, G#/Ab, A
When looking at this, you should note that A# and Bb are the same note, but there are different ways of writing them.  To parallel: 5- .5  and 4+ .5 both equal 4.5.  

You should also note that there are no half steps in between B-C and E-F.  This is because, when we first started annotating notes, we made a system that has too many letters for it to be even.  Please remember: B-C and E-F are half steps, not whole steps.  If you play them on any instrument, you’ll hear that they’re half steps.  Natural half steps can be seen [on the piano where there are no black keys in between the white ones.](http://www.google.com/imgres?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=OT26yjOx4XBQNM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ukuleletricks.com/ukulele-scales-explained-for-beginners/&amp;docid=7VH4CnPSSoAtCM&amp;imgurl=http://www.ukuleletricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/c-major-scale-piano.jpg&amp;w=362&amp;h=258&amp;ei=xgeTUOrHGYTq8gTc5oHQDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=430&amp;vpy=157&amp;dur=1336&amp;hovh=189&amp;hovw=266&amp;tx=117&amp;ty=86&amp;sig=105267377915843700322&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=140&amp;tbnw=179&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,i:74)  

Now let’s go ahead and define whole steps and half steps, as they will be very important for this entire section.   

A half step is one step along the list of notes above (for example: F to F# is a half step).  
A whole step is two steps along the list of notes above (A to B).  

Now let’s talk scales.  How do we form major scales when we only know the beginning note?  This phrase will help you dearly: We Want Him With White Woolen Hats.  W. W. H. W. W. W. H.  
Each  letter represents a step – whole or half.  
Say we start with G.  A whole step up from G is A.  A whole step from A is B.  A half step from B is C.  We continue this cycle until we get back to G.  We get this list:
G A B C D E F# G.  Congratulations! You made your first scale!  You can apply the same rule to any starting note to form any scale.  

Now let’s talk chords.  A chord is a group of 4 notes that is composed of an octave and two harmonies.  The winning formula is 1-3-5-8.  Using a scale that we just wrote, we can pick any note in the scale as our starting point.  For simplicity’s sake, let’s use the starting note: G.  
Number the scale using G as 1.  Then write out separately the notes that are numbered 1,3,5, and 8.  You end up with G, B, D, G.  This is your chord!  Starting from A, you get A,C,E,A.

There are some good examples of cardistry [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5qjPKl2qq4), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItPfAhRmWwE), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTchtsaPlF0), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5x2FQuQfTg).

 If this kind of thing interests you, keep reading, because it is a very useless talent, but very pretty in my opinion. I've been doing cardistry for about 4 years, and since it is a relatively new art form, I know a lot of the history, and so you can ask me anything on the history of cardistry, or about almost any individual member of cardistry.

If you'd like to learn, you can either buy DVD's on cardistry or learn solely from youtube videos. I personally learned from youtube videos made by [cardshark88](http://www.youtube.com/user/CardShark88/videos?sort=dd&amp;flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;page=1), it is definitely not a bad place to start off of. While i'll admit his teaching could be better, he goes over pretty much all of the basics. Once you see his tutorials, you should have no problem going through more advanced ones, which are scattered throughout youtube. 
Learning through DVD's will probably get you a good jumpstart on cardistry, but in my opinion is not worth it. Still, it is just my opinion, and many people argue that they are better. If you are searching for a beginner DVD, I would recommend [this](http://www.theory11.com/tricks/genesis-by-andrei-jikh.php). Most other DVD's are more advanced.

We also have our own [subreddit!](http://www.reddit.com/r/cardistry), as well as a few websites for cardistry. If there any questions let me know! I'd be more than happy to answer.

2) roll your 'r's (also known as an alveolar trill)

It goes like this.
1) whistle
2) Replicate whistle sound by Inhaling rather than exhaling
     A) when I do this, my whistle tends to be a higher pitch (about a 5th).
     B) it helps if the lips are wet
3) whistle inwardly and roll your r's
4) manage it in short bursts, preferably higher pitched.

Fun alternatives: Combining your alveolar trill (that is, rolling your 'r') with an outward whistle can sound like some bird calls.  Moreover combining that alveolar trill while saying "" Who whoo"" will sound like a pigeon (again, hire pitched up in your head voice).

Cricket sound is fantastic for awkward silences and when friends tell bad jokes.  Steal the punch line!

I would just like to announce, through a rigorous process, I have filed the paperwork and ""hired"" two new moderators.  Tomsawyer101, and felix1429.   Feel free to message any of us ( preferably me) about any questions, or to report any misbehavior.  I am working on a set of rules for this reddit that shall be posted shortly.  I would also like to ask for someone to think up, design, and comment a banner that we could use for this page.  (a different design for the reddit alien up top). If you're awesome, we'll use it.
Now, I have to do something I don't like to do... Whore for subscribers.  Please, throw messages about this page to other users and POST, POST, POST!
I would just love to see this page grow in numbers.

1344198051.0	xq7vc	How to convert decimal numbers to binary (and vice versa)	mostafagalal	21	2	7	"So, this isn't very hard. It's useless but awesome. I'll give you an example of how this works. Let's use the number, say, 42 (since it's the answer to life, the universe, and everything). How do we convert it to binary?

The whole idea is to express the number you chose in powers of two, and then change these twos to tens. So with 42, what you have to do is express it in sums of 2^*x* . Hence, 42 would be written 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 , or 32 + 8 + 2 = 42. (Remember: always choose the biggest powers possible and then go downwards from there, or else it won't work.) Now, take the 2^*x* numbers, and change the twos to tens, so that they'd be:

10^5 + 10^3 + 10^1

Now all you have to do is find out the value of each of these numbers and add them up. That'd be 100000 + 1000 + 10 = 101010

...and that's it! 42 in binary is 101010. If you're ever stuck with a difference of one between your value and the desired one, just remember that anything to the power of zero is one. I noticed that some of my friends forgot that while trying this method before.

Confirm your conversion results by checking with this [online converter.](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~gurwitz/core5/nav2tool.html)

So, in summary, the steps are:

* 1) Express decimal number in terms of sums of 2^x, descending from the biggest possible power to the lesser ones.
* 2) Change the twos in 2^x to tens, to be 10^x
* 3) Evaluate each 10^x term and add them together. If on paper, make sure you don't mix the decimal places up (especially with big numbers). Line them up.

Have fun!

**EDIT:** So, going backwards (converting from binary to decimals) is also possible by reversing the method.

Take a random binary number (i.e. made of ones and zeros only). Let's take 100101 for now.

* Step 1) Express the number in terms of powers of ten: 10^5 + 10^2 + 10^0 (which is really 100000 + 100 + 1)
* Step 2) Change the tens to twos, so that'd make it 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^0
* Step 3) Evaluate the result. 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 32 + 4 + 1 = 37

...and that's it! Once again, you can confirm with the online converter. Now you can convert binary and decimals forwards and backwards. Enjoy!"	t5_2u8qf	True

Take the number you want to multiply and write it down.

eg   72618

Take the last number and write it underneath.  Then starting on the right...add each digit together with the one on the left and continue until you get to the first digit of the number. Then add the original first digit. Be sure to carry any '1s' over to the next digit.

    eg           7    2     6     1      8
                / \+/  \ +/  \ + / \ + /  \

Also, this trick can be used to see stereograms and make things 3D.  Stereograms are like tessellations but when you use this trick, they become 3D (it takes some practice, but google stereograms).  As for making images 3d, you just need the same picture side by side so that you can use this trick.

I figured since I have seen some posts regarding how to get a nice signature that I, myself and many others here on the subreddit would appreciate how to write in cursive. I never really learned in school since all the teachers were fine with us just printing whenever we wrote.

*Now using the side you left down draw a line that runs parallel to your first line, choose your desired thickness. Use a clip or hair tie to restrain the hair outside of these two lines. 

*Make sure the hair is well brushed. Grab about a cm of hair from the front of the section and devide it up into three peices. I hold the two outside peices in my fist under teh pinkies then use my thumb and pointer finger to control the peice that is moving. Always move peices under the other towards the middle. To get the cornrow going I'll brain upwards 3 or 4 links. 

*After your starter links this is where you start to pick up hair. Make sure you have a firm grip on your outside peices, you need to maintain constant tention or the braid will look messy. To grab peices hold the middle peice up with your pointer and thumb finger, while maintaining tention use your other hand, go under the middle strand that you're holding up and using your thumb and pointer finger grab a small amount (about half a cm) of loose hair while grabbing the hair held in the oposite hand. While doing this switch the old middle peice into the fist of the hair that you just grabbed from. 

*Continue this motion all the way down.

*Getting the first braid is the hardest part. Once you practise the motion above you'll be able to do it flawlessly. "	t5_2u8qf	True

I memorize poetry and facts worth remembering as well as learning languages every now and then, but I want to dedicate this to something challenging, that I could possibly make money of. I've heard of people using mnemonics to play cards, but I don't know enough about card games to try that.

Ok first make sure you have at least two people catch the person that's passing out. You don't want their limp body to slam on the floor.

Step 1. Get the person that's passing out to get on all fours, look at the ground, and breathe really hard in and out through the mouth. Make sure they do this for about 20-30 seconds.

Step 2. This step, I've found, is crucial. When the 20-30 seconds is up, make sure to take one ultra long exhale.

Step 3. Hold your breath after the exhale and stand up, back against a wall clear of objects around it, and cross your arms like [this](http://www.bancroftcyberfair.com/foods/Images/arms.jpg). While doing this hold your breath.

Step 4. While the one standing on the wall holds their breath and crosses their arms as instructed, get two or three friends to push as hard as possible on the persons chest.

Step 5. After about 5-15 seconds of pushing, the subject will pass out. Usually it's easy to tell by their eyes rolling back, making a noise, etc. Now if you pushed on his chest, it's your responsibility to help him slowly down. Don't lay him down but instead set him on his bottom, back to wall. While doing this, lightly slap him.

Step 6. Within 5-15 seconds, he should regain consciousness.
