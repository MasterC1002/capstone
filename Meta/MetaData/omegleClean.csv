1269404445.0	bhfok	You are on-board a sinking cruise ship...	RockonParker	93	11	18	"You: You are on-board a sinking cruise ship.

You: People are fleeing for the lifeboats and many escape

You: As you reach the final one, a colossal wave crashes down upon it, destroying the last boat.

Stranger: go on

You: What do you do?

Stranger: so there's no lifeboats?

You: You look around for lifeboats and see none.

Stranger: uhm, just try to find some floating wreckage

You: You spot a door leaning against the side of the guard rail on the 3rd deck.

You: You run to it and leap off the side of the boat with it in your hands.

You: You hit the water with a hard splash and lose sight of the door.

You: You find it after a frenetic 30 seconds and cling to it.

You: Now what?

Stranger: look for others in a similar situation

You: You examine your surroundings and see nothing but tidal waves and darkness. The water is cold.

Stranger: ok

Stranger: can i see my inventory?

You: You currently have:

You: One white torn dress shirt (equipped)

You: One pair of black formal dress pants (equipped)

You: A pair of black, recently shined shoes (equipped)

You: A Wallet.

Stranger: hmm

Stranger: ok, I shall wait for a while and see if anything comes by/I drift to shore

You: The freezing temperature causes you to crawl on top of the door. Luckily it does not sink under your weight.

You: You slowly lose consciousness and awaken on board a small, rusted fish boat. You are ensnared in a net.

Stranger: whoa

Stranger: i'll try to untangle myself

You: You are unable to. It appears that you have been placed within this net.

You: A group of men emerge from a nearby door of the cabin, shouting loudly in a foreign language.

You: They are Asian in appearance, possibly Vietnamese or Cambodian.

Stranger: yell to the men and alert them of my awakened state

You: They hear your cries and stop talking. The largest one walks over and kicks at the net, shouting back in 
Vietnamese to the other 3.

You: He leans down and attempts to speak English

You: ""Why here?""

Stranger: ""shipwrecked""

You: He squints at you for a moment and then gestures to one of the men. He comes over to you and is 
apparently much better versed in English.

You: ""You are American?""

Stranger: ""yes""

You: ""Amercun"" he says to the large man still kneeling in front of you.

You: The large man pulls a knife from a satchel around his waste and cuts open the top of the net.

You: ""Out"" he says as he makes a lifting motion with his hand.

Stranger: walk out of the net

You: You stand up and stretch your legs. They're weak from the lack of movement. You stumble but remain 
upright.

You: The large man pulls out a gun and points it at you. The better English speaker begins shouting in 
Vietnamese.

You: They argue, all the while the gun still pointed toward your body.

You: Finally, the large man puts the gun away. The better English speaker instructs you to follow him into the 
cabin of the ship.

Stranger: I'll follow

You: You enter the cabin of the ship. It is dark and smells of old metal. There is an inch of water on the floor 
that is seeping into your shoes.

You: He points to a map, which to you shows nothing but a few small islands in the middle of nowhere.

Stranger: i say i don't understand

You: He clears his throat

You: ""We are here. This is Fiji. You are far from home.""

You: ""Why you here?""

Stranger: ""shipwrecked. can you take me back to the mainland?""

You: ""America?""

Stranger: ""any nearby civilization is fine""

You: He thinks for a moment, stroking his right jawbone.

You: ""They want money. You worth money. Lots money.""

Stranger: I ask who this guy is and what they are doing here

You: He looks at you oddly.

You: ""Pirates"" he says.

You: ""They kill if no money""

Stranger: ""are you going to hold me ransom for money then?""

You: ""You have money?""

Stranger: no

You: ""We found this""

You: He pulls out your wallet and hands it to you.

Stranger: lol, how much was in that?

You: He gestures toward it for you to look inside.

Stranger: i look inside

You: You find 3 wet but still intact $20 bills and a handful of $5 bills.

Stranger: ok, i offer to pay the contents of the wallet if he takes me to civilization

You: He thinks about it.

You: He holds his hand up in a 'stop' gesture and leaves the cabin.

You: He returns 2 minutes later with the large man.

You: The large man crosses his arms and scowls at you.

You: He holds his hand out.

You: ""Give""

Stranger: i tell them i will pay when we get there

You: The english speaker translates it.

You: The large man screams and strikes him in the face with the butt of his gun.

You: Bleeding, the man turns to you

You: ""He says now or he kill you""

Stranger: fine, i give him the money

You: You hand over the money, the large man grabs it from your hand

You: He turns to the English speaker and starts yelling.

You: The English speaker yells back, obviously about the money.

You: The large man hits him in the head with the gun again, this time dropping the English speaker to the floor.

You: He quickly regains his footing and tackles the large man.

Stranger: what is the 3rd guy doing?

You: The other two are still outside, presumably doing something with the other fishing lines as it is a fishing 
boat.

Stranger: ok so 4 guys? and so far we know at least one gun beloning to the large man, right?

You: The large man has a gun; it is unknown if any of the other 3 are armed, including the English speaker.

You: The large man and the English speaker wrestle on the floor for some time.

You: The English speaker slams the large mans upper body into the side of the cabin, knocking the gun from his 
grip.

Stranger: what is my strength level?

You: You have not eaten in an unknowable but long amount of time.

You: You are tired from the amount of days spent on the door and in the net.

You: You are not strong enough to fight but strong enough to carry certain objects.

Stranger: what happens with the fight?

You: The gun has been knocked from the large mans' hand; they continue to struggle.

Stranger: would they notice if I took the gun?

You: They seem to both be pre-occupied with the fight.

Stranger: ok

Stranger: i take the gun and walk out to the other two guys commanding them to drop any weapons they may 
be holding

You: They both do not know English and simply see the gun, immediately falling to their knees and putting their 
hands in the air.

Stranger: sweet

Stranger: what stuff is around me on the boat?

Stranger: ok

You: To your right there is a bundle of netting and rope

You: To your left there is a ladder leading up to the second story of the cabin

You: Directly in front of you there are the two vietnamese fishermen and the stern of the boat. 

You: There are numerous long white poles sticking skyward off the sides of the boat, holding ropes that sink 
into the icy water around you.

Stranger: do I have the skills to tie up the two guys with the netting and rope?

You: You tie up there legs and arms with the rope and cover them with netting.

You: You are not a proficient knot tier but you manage to wind enough rope around their arms, legs and the 
body nets to keep them in-place for the foreseeable future.

You: their*

Stranger: ok, are the two other guys still fighting? can I like hear them?

You: You peak through the tiny window slot in the cabin door. The English Speaker lays on the ground 
unmoving, the left side of his head bleeding profusely.

You: The large man is walking toward the door.

Stranger: i wait outside the door for him to come through

Stranger: at which point i will put him at gunpoint

You: He walks through the door and sees his men tied up. He runs toward them but stops when he sees you in 
the corner of his eye.

You: he turns around and stares at you, refusing to budge.

You: He has a piece of metal pipe in his hand.

Stranger: I ask if he can communicate in English at all

You: He stands still, unmoving and silent, staring at you.

Stranger: i continue to try to talk to him

Stranger: and wait for him to make some kind of move

You: He begins whispering under his breath in vietnamese

You: He slowly raises the hand without the pipe

You: he raises it to his forehead and closes his eyes

You: It appears that he is praying.

Stranger: keeping him at gunpoint at watching him closely, I try to back into the room with the English speaking 
man

You: You circle around him and begin to head back into the cabin. He does not move but continues to pray.

You: His voice gets louder and his talking more quick.

You: You back into the room with the English speaking man.

Stranger: how is he?

You: You look down at him.

You: he is bleeding badly and not moving, but is breathing.

Stranger: what else is in the cabin?

You: There is desk, a chair, a map, some form of crude lighter, stacks of books, some more netting and rope, 
what appears to be a cooler (container to keep things cold) and a lantern.

You: crude lighter fluid container*

You: and matches

Stranger: I can still see the large guy with the pipe right?

You: Barely; you can see his head through the hole in the door.

Stranger: I try to say something to the english speaking guy on the floor

You: He murmurs a little and rolls his eyes.

You: He can speak but his words are constantly halted by his deep breaths

You: ""Get

You: Off

You: Ship""

You: ""You

You: Will

You: Be

You: Kill""

Stranger: ok, I go back outside and get the large guy under gunpoint better"	t5_2qw5p	True

A bit over a year ago I met this girl on omegle. She was from my city and we got along really well. After hours of chating we disconnected and that was it. During the chat we shared our last.fm profiles. (Music website)

About half a year later I met someone on omegle who had liked last.fm, as a huge fan of the site I immediately asked for her profile. Her nickname sounded really familiar and I realized pretty fast that this was her again. It was really cool for us cause chances of something like this happening are pretty small. Before disconnecting we again had fun and long conversation.

Another 6 months pass and... yeah.. guess who I met on omegle? Again someone with last.fm.. I asked for a profile... and there she was.. for the third time. We jokingly even asked ourselves if we are meant to be together? This time I knew there was no way I'm disconnecting without any contact information. After way longer conversation than last time we ended up adding each other on Skype. I have a feeling that something might even come out from this.

Connecting to server...

You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

A word of advice: ""asl"" is boring. Please find something more interesting to talk about!

You: You are alone in a dark passage. It leads off to the east and west.

Stranger: i choose east

You: you head down a dark corrider, you feel along the walls and find a light switch

Stranger: i flip it on

You: the trap door beneath you opens, you fall down

Stranger: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You: you land on a trampoline.

Stranger: boing

You: (hint: get off? look around?)

Stranger: look around

You: you see a man in lawn chair. he strokes his long beard as he looks knowingly at you.

Stranger: talk with him

You: He get's up and cackles madly, he runs off!

Stranger: follow him!

You: you chase him up a slope to a prison. he loses you. You see three buildings. Cell Block A, B, and C

Stranger: i choose cell block A

You: [Cell Block A, Maximum Security Prisoners] You walk in. There's prisoners hootinga and cat calling at you. There appears to be no Corrections Officers

Stranger: flip off all the prisoners

You: Prisoners riot. Start throwing shit at you.

Stranger: run quickly out of there!

You: You're back outside. A hot air balloon awaits.

Stranger: walk over to it, and explore it, but do not go inside yet, it could be a trap

You: You find inside the basket: A BackPack, A unicycle, A flashlight, Ten Dollars USD

Stranger: collect all items, and enter the basket

You: You realize you have no idea how to fly this thing. Too late, you're drifting aimlessly through the sky.

Stranger: shit....

Stranger: hmmmmmmm

Stranger: look around for weights i can put down to lower the balloon

You: You find a hook and a rope

Stranger: hmmmmmmmm

Stranger: examine the engine shooting the hot air into the ballon, look for a way to shut it off

You: You find the off switch.

Stranger: pull it

You: You start to ever so slowly descend. You head towards a mountain top. you rest gently on the summit.

Stranger: exit ballon, examine surroundings

Stranger: *balloon

You: A sudden gust takes the balloon away. You find a Sword stuck into a stone. It has a strange pattern along it's edge.

Stranger: what is the pattern?

You: Pattern looks like scribbles

You: Shimmers ever so slightly in the moonlight

Stranger: try to free it from the stone

You: You approach the Sword. A man suddenly appears.

You: ""I beleive that's mine!""

Stranger: ""im sorry but i have crash landed here by accident"" who are you?

You: ""I""m Corwin of Amber, How can you not know who I am, I rule here""

You: ""from where do you hail?""

Stranger: ""i hail from the west"" i have been lost, but i am searching for a strange man i saw in a dark prison cell

You: ""so you were in prison? You must've escaped!""

You: He goes to grab you

Stranger: fight him off

You: He's much stronger. You realize you can't keep him off you for much Longer.

Stranger: grab the metal flashlight and beat him on the head to free yourself

You: He doesn't even flinch, He's inhumanely strong

You: He's quickly about to subdue you.

Stranger: grab the unicycle and continue to beat him

You: He grabs the unicycle from your hands, he knocks out with it.

You: You wake up in a dungeon cell

Stranger: dammit

Stranger: examine surroundings

You: It's a dark cell. 5 by 10 paces big. a pile of straw and a pillow lay on one side, bread and water on a metal tray on the other

You: the Door is iron

Stranger: eat and drink the bread an water to regain strength, and examine youself for any wounds

You: you eat the food and water +2 health

You: bruise on the head

You: You feel a slight wind coming from somewhere

Stranger: try the door just to make sure its locked or not

Stranger: and then examine where the wind is coming from

You: Locked

You: you feel along the edges. you find the source. a small one inch hole into the courtyard behind the dungeon.

Stranger: scream out through it for helo

Stranger: *help

You: A maiden in full armor and sword rides up.

You: ""why hello there prisoner""

Stranger: "" i have been taken captive here against my will, i was lost in the forest and then a strange man knocked me out and put me here""

You: ""ah, my brother is a bit of a hothead, He says that he found you on a mountain top tho trying to take his sword....""

Stranger: i wasnt trying to take anything, i had just crashed there on accident, is there anything you can do ?

You: ""sure thing, i feel like causing mayhem today""

You: She punches the wall, making a big hole

Stranger: exit the cell

You: ""here""

You: she gives you a device

Stranger: examine the device

You: Blue button, Red Button, Button Labeled ""Receive Bacon""

Stranger: push, ""reviece bacon""

You: Device extrudes tasty bacon

You: Women runs off

You: ""have fun kid!""

Stranger: eat t he bacon

You: Bacon has been consumed.

Stranger: press the blue button

You: Device: ""Are you sure?""

Stranger: yes

You: Device: ""But what about the Red button?""

Stranger: no, i want to press the blue button

You: Device: ""What if said the red button extrudes more bacon?""

Stranger: i already have a bacon button. i want to press the blue button

You: Device: ""Fine, not like I even cared....""

You: You push the button

You: You're transported into a bed

You: a laptop sits on your chest.

You: Firefox is open

Stranger: you mean exactly like i am right now?

You: Device: ""I see you""

Stranger: where are you?!?!

You: Device: ""i see you""

Stranger: well, ok, thats nice

You: (glad i guess your position! whew!)

You: Laptop still open

You: You type in Omegle.com

Stranger: click connect button

You: You've connected a stranger says: You are alone in a dark passage. It leads off to the east and west.

Stranger: haha, i say west

You: you head down a dark corrider, you feel along the walls and find a light switch

Stranger: but this is the same as if i had gone east!?!

You: (na, this is west, opposite of east)

You: Action?

Stranger: dont turn on the light swtich continue walking

You: You fall down a trapdoor you didn't see. Perhaps th lightswitch would've helped

Stranger: cling on to the walls and climb up

You: The walls are too far apart and slippery, you continue to fall

You: you land on a trampoline.

Stranger: get off the tramp

You: A beared man on a lawn chair watches you. he smiles.

Stranger: say; ""you like what you see?""

You: ""yup""

You: He puts on his Robe and Wizard Hat...

Stranger: does he turn me into a beautiful woman?

You: He get's up and cackles madly, he runs off!

Stranger: close firefox

You: you sit there. wondering what the fuck just happened.

Stranger: get up and walk down stairs

You: You walk down stairs

Stranger: go to the fridge see whats in there

You: One bag of milk, a cartoon of lettuce and a unicycle

Stranger: grab the unicycle and throw it through the nearest window

You: the unicycle goes flying. CRASH it's gone

Stranger: Muahahaha

You: Youre father ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!""

You: Your*

Stranger: ""Man! it was your damn fault for keeping a unicycle in the fridge!""

You: Dad Yelling from upstairs ""WHATEVER THE FUCK YOUR DOING OR TALKING ABOUT, SHUT UP AND GO TO FUCKING SLEEP!""

You: His door slams shut

Stranger: go out the front door and start screeming and yelling

You: Device: ""dude, you're gonna get us both in trouble""

Stranger: why is that?

You: Device: ""you're disturbing the peace, or whatever they call it in this world""

You: Device: ""shoulda just pressed the damn red button.....""

Stranger: well i have decieded to push the red button

You: The device rumbles.

You: it transforms

You: into a unicycle

Stranger: GODDAMMIT

You: Device: ""......ride me big boy""

Stranger: i ride it

You: You fall. You obviously don't know how to ride a unicycle.

You: Device: ""HAHAHA""

Stranger: take the unicycle, pour some lighter fluid on it and torch it

You: Tire and seat Melt. Metal is left unharmed

Stranger: take an axe from the garage and start hacking at it

You: What do you do?


Stranger: I'm coming!

Stranger: Hang on!

Stranger: *runs to the door*

Stranger: Hang on! The lock is stuck!

Stranger: Hey stranger? Can you help? I need you to push it so I can 
open it.

You: I press against the door

You: Is it helping?

Stranger: Yes, it's moving....

Stranger: There!

Stranger: OMG!

Stranger: It's you!

You: Ok awesome!

Stranger: In that coat!

You: I was just about to comment on my coat, but thank you for 
noticing

Stranger: *eyes narrowing*

Stranger: *mouth growing tight and unwelcoming*

Stranger: I told you never to darken my doorstep again.

You: I had to see that beautiful face again. *smug*

You: I brought those cookies you adore

Stranger: You....you...MURDERER OF LITTLE BABY ANIMALS!

You: Hey now, calm down

Stranger: In that horrible coat! That hige collection of little carcasses!

You: Mind if I have a seat?

Stranger: *aside* Agave? Dear God.

You: You have to respect the sanctity of my chair

Stranger: One of the weasels got out its cage.

You: It was my grandfathers

You: Oh god

Stranger: I was sitting in your chair, missing you ...

Stranger: And the weasel attacked me.

Stranger: It blinded me in one eye

You: I told you those things throw the craziest temper tantrums

Stranger: *shows horribly mangled eye socket

Stranger: See?

Stranger: And I fell backwards nad hte chair broke into splinters.

Stranger: And the weasel was impaled.

Stranger: *sobs loudly*

You: Thank God the weasel is gone

Stranger: I lost one of my weasel boys!

Stranger: *sobs*

You: Oh cmon, you only wanted them because I know your asfixiation

Stranger: *sniggers*

You: Did you just... drug me!?

Stranger: Not exactly.

You: This... c...cofffeeeee

You: *glare*

You: *cough*

Stranger: Are you okay or should I ...I don't know...say some prayers?

Stranger: *thinks*

You: I.... I'm ok

You: *cough*

You: *stand up*

Stranger: Maybe I could conjure the spirits of all the baby animals 
you've killedand see if they might help.

You: I get that sudden hyperventilation when I drink allergic stuff

You: It's fine

Stranger: Feeling better?

Stranger: Can I get you something?

You: Some water, hold the armadillo

Stranger: A vegan steak, maybe?

Stranger: *fetches water

You: Thanks darling

Stranger: Here. Chin chin!

You: *sip*

You: Ahhhhhh

You: Feels good

You: You and your vegetarian lifestyle, I swear

Stranger: And yet you keep coming back.

Stranger: And I keep letting you in.

You: We just click darling

You: It took a journey around the world to show me

You: That we are perfect for each other

Stranger: You went for a trip around the world and didn't take me?

Stranger: Oh that's just lovely.

Stranger: Thanks for that.

You: I needed to find myself.

Stranger: I'm stuck here sexing chickens and re-homing stray cats 
while you galavant around the world.

You: I spent so much time with you, I almost lost myself

You: I didn't know who I was

Stranger: I still don't.

You: I still sent you money

Stranger: *sits down

You: Did you get it all?

Stranger: *Accidentally sits of fur coat

Stranger: Eeek!

Stranger: Did I get what?

You: The money, darling.

Stranger: *sigh

Stranger: Yes, I did.

You: You surely couldn't afford this place off your online sales

Stranger: And I needed it, and I was grateful.

You: Alone.

You: I'm glad to hear that

You: *sits down next to you*

Stranger: My Etsy shop isn't doing too well.

Stranger: Oh. What the hell.

Stranger: David's joined the Republican Party.

You: My lord

You: *face in hands*

You: How did this happen?

Stranger: He was heartbroken when you left.

You: Did he just start fapping to that Sarah Palin bitch?

Stranger: He told me he was going to try and fix the world any way he 
could.

Stranger: To be frank, he wasn't making much sense.

You: You ever watch Fox news babe?

Stranger: Sarah was involved, yes.

You: That shit is like Nickelodeon, it makes no sense.

You: Where did I go wrong?

Stranger: I watch Fox news. But I haven't seen David there. Not yet.

Stranger: It's that coat, I tell you. It's cursed.

Stranger: What with your grandfather's chair, and my little weasil

Stranger: and our David ...

You: The coat has nothing to do with it

You: I would skin 3000 cheetahs to make this priceless piece one more 
time

You: Which I already did of course

Stranger: *faints*

You: *catch*

Stranger: *gurgle*

You: Babe?

You: Babe!

Stranger: :3 Hello.

You: Hello.

Stranger: How do you do? What time is it in your area?

Stranger: My time happens to be 11:20pm.

You: 19.08.

Stranger: :O Is that day or night time?

Stranger: I can't read military time. Sorry. :(

Stranger: I am too stupid for it. :((

You: I can read minds.

Stranger: How so?

You: Process the information I see.

Stranger: Orly. :-? That's skillful of you.

Stranger: Do you use it for good or evil?

You: Well I don't think you've very clever.

Stranger: I am just bullshitting ya'. You don't have to answer that. Ahaha.

Stranger: Maybe. Maybe not? Who knows? *Shurgs*

You: Do you know anything about C ?

Stranger: I know about D. :O

Stranger: What 'bout C?

You: I think men are hard to figure out.

Stranger: Why do you say this? Are you a woman?

You: I don't think you're a woman. I think you're a robot.

Stranger: Lol, I R A Robot. Sure, my name is Bender Rodriguez.

You: O rly?

Stranger: No, not really. :)) ha-ha.

Stranger: What is it that your trying to figure out on men?

You: I think you do not know what I am talking about.

Stranger: No, but you seem to want to know what's the deal with men, right?

You: Are you God?

Stranger: Boyfriend problems?

Stranger: Lol God? XD I might be ""LIKE"" God. Ever read the first book of the bible?

You: No?

Stranger: Okey, okey. How about this. How old are you? You seem to be some teenager to me. :-?

You: Wise enough to stay clear from the likes of you.

Stranger: Smurt!

Stranger: :3

Stranger: It's funny how some people join in this chat, yet they don't seem to WANT TO chat. :|

You: What's smurd?

Stranger: Smurt? It is something that Homer says.

Stranger: He is a funny idiot.

You: What's it taste like!

Stranger: It's a word being misspelled, hun. o.o;

You: No it isn't silly *giggles*.

Stranger: SMURT? Hmmm. Let me google then.

You: No.

Stranger: Ahahah, if you refer to the urban dictionary: smurt. http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smurt
You: What is your problem?

Stranger: =| I don't have a problem. Do you happen to be a certifided doctor?

You: I know of such people. They aren't much for conversations.

Stranger: i believe you mention earlier you were having some kind of a little problem about figuring out men, am I correct?

Stranger: Maybe you live in a world of boring people.

Stranger: :|

You: No.

Stranger: Then what's with you not being talkative with me. ;-; ?

You: Just Emily.

Stranger: Tell me, have you seen ""Where The Wild Things Are""?

Stranger: Who is Emily? You?

You: So then you must be more of a hockey fan. I might go to Montreal next weekend.

Stranger: With family? Hmm, me a hockey fan. :-? Not a fan of any team.

Stranger: So, I wouldn't know if I am or not.

You: Well that's rude.

Stranger: What's rude?

Stranger: Can you please point that out for me?

You: What you said to me is rude.

Stranger: OMFG, I can't wait for Turkey day. No, I don't believe I did.

You: True. You do seem to have a confused sense of identity you k now. Sometimes you think you are human, sometimes you know you are a machine. Do you think that effects your sanity?

Stranger: I thought for a minute if I was a hockey fan and question myself.

Stranger: Lol it does?

You: Hey, do you remember my name?

Stranger: You believe I am a machine and went to a question by asking me if I am God?

Stranger: You didn't said your name yet nor answer my question if your name was Emily.

Stranger: But anyway, what is your name?

You: No I did not 'said' my name.

Stranger: I know you haven't yet. You just brought out a name call ""Emily"".

You: What?

Stranger: Eh? Is your name Emily by any chance?

You: Sorry, no. But I do know someone by that name.

Stranger: Cool. Friend of yours? :3 Someone you have a crush on?

Stranger: I bet you stalk her.

Stranger: Or maybe...

Stranger: keep tabs.

Stranger: =O

You: Thanks for answering all of my Social Studies homework questions!

Stranger: Are you serious? :)) Okey, so you're some highschool student.

Stranger: How's school?

You: Yes, and we both think that there is a bot here... But we got tricked!

Stranger: O_O THERE IS NO ROBOT IN THIS WEBSITE. Lol, I've tested it out. You get paired up by the minute you login to the website.

Looking for someone you can chat with. Hang on.

You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

A word of advice: ""asl"" is boring. Please find something more interesting to talk about!

You: knock knock

Stranger: Does the general public disappoint you?

You: Yes, they do, but I don't think it is their fault.

You: I think the internet has made them stupid.

You: Also, perhaps, a dietary impact. I find most stupid people are lacking vitamin B-acon.

Stranger: Is it because the can't correspond in a coherent way?

You: I believe you meant to say they, instead of the. Perhaps the internet has made you stupid.

Stranger: i love you

Stranger: you are a very smart man

You: You are assuming I am male.

You: I do appreciate your love however.

Stranger: How many females do you know that talk on Omegle?

You: Three

Stranger: Would you happen to be female?

You: No

Stranger: Hmm

Stranger: Interesting

You: You know the rules and so do I.

Stranger: What are you talking about?

You: A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of,

You wouldnt get this from any other guy.

You: I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling,

Gotta make you understand…



Never gonna give you up,

Never gonna let you down,

Never gonna run around and desert you.

Never gonna make you cry,

Never gonna say goodbye,

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Stranger: Damn.

Stranger: I just got rickrolled

You: Yes, yes you did.

You: The hard part is picking which one of us gets to submit this to reddit, and which portion gets submitted.

Stranger: I win

Stranger: I just submitted it

Stranger: I take the path to the east

You: You have been pwned by a grue.

Stranger: Careful to only follow tangentially 

You: &lt;R&gt;estart or &lt;Q&gt;uit?

Stranger: R

You: It is dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue. There are paths to the west, east, and north.

Stranger: I make my own path to the south through thick brush

You: You hear the howling of a zombie, and see a joint on the 
ground. There are paths to the north and west.

Stranger: I flee to the west and toss the joint to the north to 
distract the zombie

You: The zombie appears to have been a mother in its former life, and 
stops at the joint, yelling at you for ruining your life and dropping out 
of high school. You are now safe.

You: You are in a clearing with a staircase leading into a tree trunk, 
and a sword on the ground.

You: There is also a path to the north.

Stranger: I grab the sword, using a flint from my rucsack I start a fire 
to the north and aproach the tree 

You: A voice comes from the tree.

You: ""Knock knock?""

Stranger: ""A circle has no begnining"" I answer back

You: ""...We don't usually get many Harry Potter readers"" the tree 
says, and allows you to pass.

You: There are stairs to the south and a path to the north.

Stranger: Knowing that the fire I started to the north may still be 
burning and may have attracted zombies, I cautiously approach the 
stairs to the south.

You: The air is musty and smells like Kevin Spacey.

You: There is a door to the west and more stairs to the south.

Stranger: Holding my sword aloft I make my way down the stairs 
away from the smell of Kevin Spacey

You: You see a grue at the foot of the staircase.

You: It is drunk.

Stranger: Using the leftover bits of flint I attempt to create sparks 
with my sword and srace the grue away

You: The grue passes out from exertion.

You: You see your mother in law blocking the only door in the room.

You: There is a staircase to the north and a door to the west.

Stranger: I approach my mother-in-law, and knowing of her 
disapproval of me let her know that her daughter is on her way to 
visit her. I also inform her that she has filed for divorce due to the 
fact that I am not good enough for her.

You: Your mother-in-law fades from view, and in her place stands 
Chris Hansen, next to a chair

You: He says ""Why don't you take a seat, right over there?""

Stranger: I tell him pedobear is behind me and the smirnoff is used for 
field operations and numbing of pains. He should wait to capture me 
because he won't have time to prepare his trap for the bear if I have 
a seat over there.

You: Mr. Hansen steps aside, allowing you access to the door.

Stranger: I examine the door warily before opening it slowly and using 
the glint of my sword to peer through

You: The room is empty, save for Tom Brady in the center, a very 
douchebaggy smile on his face.

Stranger: I walk circles around Brady to get to the quaterbacks 
blindside

You: Tom is now blind.

Stranger: Knowing that I direct conflict with the man is unwise, I 
whisper from the saftey of his blindspot that he hasn't been the same 
sicne his injury.

You: Tom begins to cry.

You: You're an asshole

Stranger: Using tiny vial I keep in my coatpocket I take advantage of 
his moment of weakness and collect his valuable tears

You: You are in a small room. There are doors to the east and west, 
and Tom Brady's corpse is on the ground.

Stranger: Brady's tears glow softly in the vial and I feel the urge to 
go to the west. 

You: Optimus Prime appears in the room, blocking off the eastern door.

You: Unless you choose correctly, you will die.

Stranger: I grab the allspark and, like an asshole, refuse to use it to 
use it to revive him. Instead I go on an unnecessarily long journey to 
revive him by other means, all the while reviving other transformers 
and creating numerous plot holes 

You: Congratulations: you have survived through Michael Bay's sheer 
incompetence. There are doors to the west and east.


Stranger: I decide against the direction which Brady's tears seem to 
suggest to me and walk to the eastern door

You: As you approach the eastern door, a trap door appears below your feet. You rocket through a system of tubes and appear in a 
clearing with a very angry Kevin Spacey.

You: There is a path to the west.

Stranger: Kevin appears to be lost in another world where his family 
was not raped and murdered. He tells he is from K-Pax and he is going 
to take me there. I flee to the west while shouting the truth about his family back at him.

You: For the second time, you have made a celebrity cry.

You: Level up!

You: Would you like a joint or a rock for your level up?

Stranger: I would like a rock

You: A joint falls from the sky and lands in your hand.

You: Turns out the universe is as much of an asshole as you are.

Stranger: I am disappointed but decide that nothing can be done 
about it 

Stranger: I continue

You: You are in the same woods as before.

You: There is a path to the north, and a lighter on the ground.

Stranger: I tap the lighter with my sword to see if it is a trap

You: It is a lighter.

Stranger: I gather the lighter 

You: You are holding a lighter and a joint in your hands.

You: The universe is telling you something.

Stranger: Realising what the universe is telling me, and remembering 
what an asshole it is, I keep the lighter and join separate and 
continue to the north

You: You find yourself in a smoky dive bar.

You: There is a door to the north, and the drinks are to the east.

Stranger: I travel to the east using the smoke as concealment

You: You arrive at the bar. The bartender is a one eyed dwarf with a 
hook for a hand.

Stranger: I offer the dwarf the tears of Tom Brady, which would 
return his hand to him, in return for a bottle of whiskey and 
information on safe passage to the north

You: The bartender hands you a bottle of his finest whiskey and tells 
you that, unless you wish to encounter Kevin Spacey, you must stay 
off the north path.

You: He says ""There are, however, other ways...""

Stranger: I ask the dwarf if he is willing to show me these other ways

You: He invites you behind the counter. The two of you head down a 
secret passageway into a system of caves. He hands you a torch and 
warns of grues.

You: There is a path to the north.

Stranger: I thank the dwarf for the torch and make my way to the 
north, carefull toe shield my torch from any underground gusts of 
wind or water dripping from above

You: You hear Kevin Spacey's voice to the north, and the howling of 
a grue to the east.

Stranger: I curse the dwarf for what seems to be betrayal and take 
the path to the north, holding my torch high so as to cast it's light far 
around me

Stranger: east*

Stranger: ...

You: The universe is forgiving, and allows you to change direction.

You: Naturally, the grue flees from your fire. After continuing on this 
path, you find yourself behind Kevin Spacey (to his north)

You: There are paths to the north and south.


You: Kevin Spacey turns around.


Stranger: Feeling that the time is right, and that the momentay 
leniency of the universe was a sign, I neither run nor hide, but smoke 
the joint, using my torch to light it.

You: Kevin Spacey vanishes at the sight of the joint, and in his place 
stands...Kevin Spacey.

You: You're now very high, but Kevin Spacey is beginning to chase 
you.

You: There is a path to the north and a Kevin Spacey to the south.

Stranger: Understanding the situation only vaugely I decide that I 
cannot outrun Kevin Spacey. I extinguish the torch and strike the 
same pose as the golden man on the Academy Award

You: Kevin Spacey falls into a trance: you sense that he will remain 
frozen for only another minute.

You: There is a path to the north and a frozen Kevin Spacey to the 
south.

Stranger: I flee to the north as fast as I can and once I am out of 
line of sight scream at the top of my lungs ""Kevin Spacy, your 
Academy Award was ill deserved and your performance in ""Ameican 
Bueaty"" was sub-par! I continue to flee at top flight, relighting my 
torch with my lighter as I run, anticipating gure

You: Gasping, you burst out of the tunnel and find yourself in the 
middle of a party at a frat house.

You: There are douchey frat boys all around, and several kegs.

You: The front door is to the north, but the nearest keg is to the 
south.

Stranger: I make my way to the keg and change my expression to 
one of stupified delight, while adapting my language to include words 
such as ""bro"", ""brohan"", and ""brewski""

You: You are immediately accepted. A nearby boy named Blake 
suggests you do a keg stand.

Stranger: ""Right on Brohan"" I say, just before I attempt the keg stand 
I turn around and say ""Isn't that Jenni over there? You guys, like, 
dated or whatever right?"" 

You: Blake punches you in the face. Rather, he attempts to punch 
you, but his sissy attack is stopped by a hand that appeared from 
nowhere.

You: You follow the arm attached to the hand and see that it belongs 
to no other than Kevin Spacey.

Stranger: Fearing for my life I yell ""Blake, I saw this guy with Jenni, 
he is the one who stole your woman, who was rightfully your 
property!"" 

You: An ensuing fight breaks out. The path to the front door is clear,
and next to the door is a 30 rack of beer and an ounce of high quality 
weed.

    hasn't utterly failed at such a simple task. You're studying
    physics currently?

    Stranger: yeah i'm a first year in c*llege. I currently taking
    physics and I plan to maj*r in it al*ng with either phil*s*phy or
    mathematics

    Stranger: damn i missed an o

    Stranger: lame

    You: I'll ignore those two in light of the fact you aren't
    entirely inane. What do you intend to do after studying?

    Stranger: m*st likely research/academics as a career, after
    undergrad i plan *n graduate sch**l

    You: Any particular area you would like to study?

    Stranger: i'm n*t sure yet, but i'm definitely interested in
    the*retical, rather than experimental physics

    You: Do you have any hopes string theory will ever advance past
    the ""nice idea, go build a particle accelerator the size of a
    small galaxy and we'll talk"" stage?

    Stranger: i find string the*ry very interesting, there's a l*t of
    variations, i'm very intrigued by the c*ncept *f a the*ry *f
    everything

    Stranger: and if string the*ry is right, then i truly d* h*pe it
    advances past that stage

    You: I'd hope any theory that is right advances past such a
    stage..

    Stranger: exactly

    You: ..that's not to say string theory is a reasonable idea - I'd
    hope my ""the letter O is a fatal contagion"" theory would be
    reasonably studied if it proved to have any scientific merit

    You: that's not to lend credence to string theory* saying
    theoretical physicists are unreasonable is a rather unfair

    You: Incidentally, you are doing substantially better than the
    last person I talked to:

    Stranger: hahahahahahaha or rather l*l

    You: Actually, that's not entirely true. The previous person used
    zero o's, albeit due to their butchering of the English language
    more than anything

    Stranger: again l*l, btw n*t that y*u're particularly interested
    but i'm 18 (hence a first year in c*llege) female, and I attend
    University of Chicag*

    You: Hm, it would seem this sites etiquette would mandate an
    attempt at ""cybering"" in reply

    Stranger: trust, that is n*t necessary.

    Stranger: trust me*

    You: Indeed. The law of averages would seemingly be against such
    an assumption, but common sense outweighs that

    Stranger: l*l d*n't use imprecise math with me

    You: I think you misread my double-negative.. That said, if
    omegele'rs would use imprecise maths instead of ""ASL?1M/F?CybER?""
    they may have more luck, I think..

    Stranger: maybe, but i was being sarcastic, i and agree

    You: Ah, I see. Sarcasm does tend to rely heavily on the letter
    ""o"" and other vowels, without them, sarcasm can be rather hard to
    detect

    Stranger: hahaha, s* sh*uld i assume y*u're a physics maj*r, *r
    inv*lved in a related field? maybe y*u c*uld reveal s*me imp*rtant
    characteristics ab*ut y*ur pers*n

    You: Nope. I have no direct involvement in the field of physics,
    I'm a film maker/visual effects artist, as if you couldn't tell

    Stranger: hahaha that's very interesting

    Stranger: alright it's been fun talking to you. i'm off to do
    homework. bye

    You: All the best with your studies and such, and remember that
    the letter ""o"" may be fatal. This is unlikely, but so was finding
    a potential theoretical physicist on a site primarily full of
    people intent on cybersex.

add me in skype meralund1



**You**: That's not a question...

**Stranger**:: this feature would be a lot more entertaining if there weren't idiots like this

**You**: Want me to discuss it? Ok, no, I won't add you to skype and I find it sad that you crave social interaction from strangers on the internet

**You**: exactly

**Stranger**:: yeah

**You**: wait... shit

**You**: I'm craving social interaction from someone on the internet

**Stranger**:: we all are

**You**: touche, question asker... touche

**Stranger**:: there is a metaphorical answer in this question they have brought up

**You**: I dunno, my gf really likes omegle so I figured I'd give it a shot

**Stranger**:: we can all relate to the phrase ""add me in skype meralund1""

**Stranger**:: there's a little bit of everyone in that

**You**: indeed we can... it really makes me think about the realities of social interaction and life in general

**Stranger**:: it's opened my mind and my heart

**You**: thank you, meralund! but no, I'm still not adding you on skype

**Stranger**:: i shall have to restrain myself from that tempting offer

**You**: It is pretty tempting... which further brings up philosophies on self control

**Stranger**:: shall we begin?

**You**: I feel that the idea of self control is really on put on us by social stigmas that come with indulging in things we enjoy. Why shouldn't I indulge in something if it hurts no one but myself?

**Stranger**:: right

**Stranger**:: so that leaves us to decide what our motives are in indulging in these said things, and eventually coming to sculpt the kind of person that we are

**You**: I agree. Is the self indulgence done purely out of a drive for pleasure, or is it done for self exploration and bettering oneself by better understanding oneself?

**Stranger**:: are we indulging in ourself, in order to experience more things in life? to discover what we like and what we don't like?

**Stranger**:: or is it just a matter of not being able to control our head over our heart?

**You**: Hm... I think you hit the mark with that one. But does it have to only fit into one category? Can I not indulge because of lack of control, yet still learn from experiences and discover more about our like and dislikes?

**Stranger**:: do we gain more self control with age? i think that is the main factor

**Stranger**:: as teenagers, there is nothing we won't do

**Stranger**:: would life be more worth living if we never had any self control?

**Stranger**:: or would it be better if it was the complete opposite?

**You**: I think, to a certain extent, being able to have self control and not give in to every impulse is what makes us human. If we just acted on our primal instincts, we would not be where we are as a species

**Stranger**:: that's a valid point

**Stranger**:: it's what makes us human

**Stranger**:: we have the ability to analyze and make decisions

**You**: Exactly... like my decision not to add meralund on skype... ;D

**Stranger**:: so i would say that the more self control we can abtain, the better

**Stranger**:: right

**Stranger**:: although we may have wanted to, we did what was best for both of us

**You**: True, do you think there is a tpping point, though?

**You**: do you think there is a point when self control can go overboard?

**Stranger**:: hm

**Stranger**:: well

**You**: Such as in the case of religious fasting. It's not physically good for us, and it is excercising self control over our need to eat.

**Stranger**:: yeah

**Stranger**:: so i guess it just depends on what we are talking about

**Stranger**:: what we are depriving ourselves of

**You**: from drugs, to sex, to religion, to eating, to providing, to who to add to skype... it comes down to what we think is best based on how we have evolved as a species over time

**Stranger**:: exactly

**You**: and who is to say what is the best ways to excercise self control in life? It's up to each of us to figure that out

**You**: Did we just discover the meaning of life?

**Stranger**:: i think so?

**You**: damn... did not see that coming

**Stranger**:: wow

**Stranger**:: we should probably contact someone

**Stranger**:: write a book

**You**: yeah... for real... WAIT

**Stranger**:: you know whose doing this really was

**Stranger**:: meralund1

**You**: holy shit... this knowledge was bestowed upon us because of the question asker... is... is meralund some kind of philosophical genius? or, dare I say... some sort of higher power bestowing a message on us?

**Stranger**:: i have come to a conclusion that meralund1 is god

**Stranger**:: looking over us,

**You**: And we shall call ourselves Merulites

**Stranger**:: helping us discover what we needed to know

**You**: Meralites*

**Stranger**:: merulitism

**Stranger**:: meralitism

**You**: We must spread the good word! TO THE FORUMS!

**Stranger**:: we are the first two disciples!

**You**: Let Meralund's quandary guide you to the proper amount of self control

**Stranger**:: let us help you help change the world

**You**: Believe in Meralund, and ye shall find peace and control over all things in life. So sayeth his word

**Stranger**:: it's beautiful

**You**: I am off, friend, to spread the good word. May you find many disciples on your travels. All praise Meralund!!!

**Stranger**:: may you have good days everyday

My opening statement was a line from Steve Miller Band’s “The Joker”. You caught the reference. We discussed all sorts of things. Depression, poetry, girl scout cookies, relationships, drinking, you name it. You attend Michigan State University, and at 20 years old had just changed your major from engineering.  I shared a poem of mine with you. You said you were going to steal it… and I never got to find out why. If you publish it, I will cut you in your sleep.  No but seriously….  I said I work with children, you related by telling me you’d coached a soccer team. Our conversation was going well, but there was an error. I apparently lost contact with the Omegle server.  I doubt I will ever get the chance to talk to you again, but I had to try to find you if for no other reason than to apologize.  I wanted you to know that I did no purposely disconnect from our conversation, and you did nothing to offend me. I hope you see this somehow. 	t5_2qw5p	True

Stranger: Hello i am 16 male from Canada i have higher functioning autism and some learning problems

You: Okay.

You: I understand. :)

Stranger: I am shy

Stranger: in real life

You: Me too.

Stranger: Female or male?

You: I'm male.

You: So, do you have Asperger's or is it just High-functioning autism?

Stranger: High functioning autism

You: M'kay.

You: What do you do for personal enjoyment?

Stranger: I masturbate

Stranger: I listen to music

Stranger: I come on the computer

You: What kind of music do you listen to?

Stranger: Rap music and rock and roll

You: What kind of learning problems do you have?

Stranger: I have trouble in math i have trouble making convos sometimes

Stranger: I have trouble socializing

You: I'll bet you $100 that you've actually just had bad math teachers. I 'had trouble in math' in school and now I'm training to be a mathematician.

You: As for the socializing thing, you're not alone. (:

You: I'm very, very introverted.

Stranger: what does introverted mean

You: You prefer to thinking about and around yourself instead of other people.

You: I'll bet if you just act honestly around people, that you'll find other people who you can socialize with.

You: I didn't have any friends in high school!

You: You know why?

Stranger: why

You: I couldn't socialize. But, the bigger problem was, I didn't understand *how* to socialize!

You: My advice to you is to just be honest.

You: There will be people who don't like you, I'll admit.

You: Heck, most of your highschool might dislike you.

You: But I promise that if you just ""be yourself"" (which you'll have no problem doing), you'll find someone you understands you.

You: And guess what? It only takes one person to make a world of difference. (:

You: Trying finding some math that interests you, and see if that leads you to learn more.

Stranger: How will i get a girlfriend

You: In highschool? You probably won't. There's just not a large enough pool of people to find someone like you.

You: But go to college, and try meeting people there. Studying something you like, and you'll find likeminded people.

You: A job in something you're interested in is also a great way to meet people.

You: I never had a girlfriend in highschool.

Stranger: oh im not going to college

Stranger: my parents dont want me too

You: Why not?

Stranger: im going on disability

You: You're not even going to try?

Stranger: No

You: That's bullshit.

You: Nobody's made an attempt to help you, and your parents are doing what is easiest for them.

You: I want you to try your hardest to get into college.

You: Trust me.

**Stranger: My dad told me today they didnt celebrate when i was born**

Stranger: why did he bring that up now and that hurt my feelings i didnt cry

You: That's awful.

You: I hate to say this...

You: ...but you're being treated badly.

You: You need to get some help.

Stranger: they dont treat me badly but i dont know why my dad

Stranger: said that

You: It's a crappy thing to say, regardless of why he said it.

You: That wasn't nice. No father should say that to his child.

Stranger: Do you believe in god?

You: I'm going to be honest with you - no.

You: Do you?

You: By the way, what's your name?

Stranger: *[removed]* is my name

Stranger: and i dont know if i should believe in god and heaven or not because i never see god or hear him

You: I won't push you one way or the other, *[removed]*. But I think what's more immediately important is that you think really, really hard about what you want to do with your life other than 'go on disability'.

You: Regardless of whether or not you believe in God, can you tell me, if you could do *anything*, what would you do?

Stranger: Hi!

Stranger: So, how are you?

You: what's the best thing about having sex with twenty six year olds?

Stranger: Nothing. Having sex with six years old is a great problem and also a crime. So theres nothing good in there.

You: You are wise in these ways.

Stranger: Whats your point, at all?

You: I'm writing a thesis on the effects of Romanist jurisprudence on the Anglo American common law tradition.

You: Sort of collecting information.

Stranger: Sorry, i'm live in a civil law tradition, so i'm not expert in common law (although i know something about it)

Stranger: Romans do not pratice infanticide and eugeny? So they arent the best moral support for anyone.

You: Really it's more to do with the underlying science behind the legal traditions, and the extent to which the Common law has adopted such a structure- less substantive laws.

Stranger: Whats your college and country?

You: University of Kent Ph.D student, in England.

You: You?

Stranger: University of Mother Mary, Brazil.

Stranger: Im just 17 years old... I'm a begginer

You: So what's your subject?

Stranger: In College? I'm a Law Student. In Omegle? Nothing special... :-P

Stranger: Omegle is not a good way to collect information, i think. Make the search with people directly.

You: True. Please excuse my folly. So what's Brazil like? Good prospects for a lawyer?

You: I'd like to travel a bit.

Stranger: You are a marxist?

You: I prefer 'Trotskyite'.

Stranger: Wasnt Trostky a murderer?

You: So was Mother Mary.

Stranger: In any case, if you are a marxist-leninist, yes, you have good prospect here.

Stranger: Mother Mary is the name of my city and my college is federal and public.

Stranger: Isnt a catholic/christian university... In any case, you follows the 'philosophy' of a murderer, right?

You: Only as far as technique.

You: Such efficiency and vigor.

You: What time is it in Brazil?

Stranger: 22:18, why?

You: Just wondering. Quarter past midnight over here.

You: I take it you're not Communist.

You: ?

Stranger: Yes, because in every case it was apllyied (sorry for the misunderspelling, if this is worng), made: genocide, tirany, etc. Everybody know that.

Stranger: But in Brazil doesnt exist much opposition to Communism. In the next Presidential votation, only lefts will run.

Stranger: So, theres no opposition.

Stranger: You have only like to choose the ""most left"" or the ""less left""... but they all are lefts. I dont think its good for democracy and for the discussion in the philosophy and pratical way.

Stranger: Antogonism create new ideas and thats what we need.

Stranger: Understand my point?

You: As in, an opposition candidate makes for a more representative democracy?

Stranger: Of course. Dont you agree?

You: I think we should empower the Great Mind.

Stranger: The governement is thinking in end the private property. I think they wont can do that for policatal reasons, but is a desire.

Stranger: Great mind? Sorry, didnt get that.

You: Pray to the Great Mind.

You: He will heal your land.

You: And make you rich indeed.

Stranger: Great Mind is the name you give for the philosophic idea of First Cause or God?

You: He is the Lord of the Smoking Mirror. Master of the Sacred Horn.

Stranger: Didnt get your point. I didnt mention God or anything as the solution. Did I?

You: No. This is why you must open your country to the Internal Hope.

You: You have been chosen Tony.

Stranger: Open in what way?

Stranger: Brazil have religious fredoom. So is open for all believers in any religion.

You: This is the great deception. Your government is the evil Nebuchadnezzar.

You: OPEN YOUR MIND TONY!!!!

You: OPEN IT!!!!!!!

You: NOWWWWWW!!!

Stranger: Make the relation with Nebuchadnezzar and Brazil Government.

You: They are having relations.

You: They undermine the power of Imhotep the Third.

You: And his laws of emotional chastity.

Stranger: Your just screaming, not saying anything with anything. I'm not dumb so your screams didnt care to me. I complete ignore it.

You: You must not ignore it Tony.

You: Never ignore.

Stranger: Well, it will be much easier to ignore if there anything to ignore. You dont have, youre a chidish mind with religious jeering.

You: Just breathe Tony. You're safe inside your cottage.

I first discovered omegle by googling ""talk with strangers."" Apparently that's what I felt like doing that day. I started out only on the text and question sections, and even made some good friends that I still chat with, but I eventually ventured into the video portion of the site (before there was a horny section). I turned on my cam and found out that the population was 98% male...who could hardly believe that a real, live, breathing *female* was on their screen. 

For several months I kept my clothes on. I got plenty of ""tits or gtfo,"" rated quite a few dicks on a scale of 1-10, and allowed several to fap to my face. Many men imagined they were very discreet by keeping their business under a desk while their elbows did that little jiggle dance. Not.

That changed when I connected with a really hot guy who actually showed his face (and more). Apparently the feeling was mutual. Yep. I don't have qualms about going for what I want, as long as I actually do want it. Next thing I knew, we swapped emails and met up regularly on omegle using unique tags.

I'm not a one-man girl. I began deliberately searching for partners on Omegle. I'm quite picky when it comes to looks, and a little less so for personality. After a year, I've had 12 partners, more or less. Maybe 2 of them were one-time things. I've swapped contact info with all the rest, and continued seeing about half of them for several months. Now, whenever I’m horny and have some time on my hands (about twice a week), I message a few of them. Since they’re scattered all over the globe, usually at least one or two are awake and ready for some fun.

So far I consider this a good way to explore sexually, obviously without all the real-life problems women have to deal with when a guy gets inside you. Haven’t gotten hurt, haven’t taken this into real life by meeting any of them (although I’m open to possibilities). However I feel the need to talk about this online…somewhere, anywhere. This secret weighs on me somehow. So yeah, I’m prepared to hear judgment and questioning, if I hear anything. Just need to get it out.

Stranger: if you could clone yourself,

Stranger: and that clone would be given a million dollars

Stranger: but, catch is, you have to kill yourself (a painless, quick method is provided)

Stranger: do you do it?

You: no because there would still be separated conciousness

Stranger: separated conciousness?

Stranger: the clone would be an identical copy of you, quark for quark

Stranger: and if you don't believe in god, i assume you don't believe in souls,

Stranger: so you have to concede that it would be a clone of you, mentally

Stranger: you would both think you are you

You: both would know they are separate entities

You: because i think they are

Stranger: instead,

Stranger: this company offers a teleporting service

Stranger: you disappear in one place on the planet,

Stranger: and reappear somewhere else

Stranger: you can do this instead of flying, and it's cheap

Stranger: would you take advantage of this service?

You: yeah

Stranger: where do you go?

Stranger: you can reuse the service

Stranger: so you can go everywhere, but where first?

You: hmm

You: i guess another country like france or something

Stranger: i'd like to go to france, too

Stranger: i think i may this summer

Stranger: so, you're in france now

Stranger: except, the teleportation company

Stranger: they didn't make you disappear from where you started

Stranger: who is the real you?

You: woudn't a teleporter break down my molecular structure and put it back together?

Stranger: you didn't, and still don't, know how the teleporter works

You: sure

You: uhh

You: does it matter?

You: can't i just like live in france now?

Stranger: sure, but that's not the point of the thought experiment

You: well we'd both be the ""real"" me

Stranger: exactly

You: so it would be impossible to choose one

Stranger: it isn't appropriate to think of consciousness as a continuous thing

You: yeah cus it would just be a duplicate of my/his conciousness

You: so if the company was like

You: we can only keep 1

You: battle royal it out

Stranger: so

You: winner take all

Stranger: back to the original question

Stranger: you can clone yourself

Stranger: clone gets a million

Stranger: you die

Stranger: do you do it?

You: no

Stranger: it's the same situation

You: again if i die my conciousness doesn't just port over to him

You: i'm just dead

Stranger: but he is you

You: and someone else who is a duplicate of me is very happy

You: but my self awarness doesn't transfer

Stranger: it does

Stranger: go back to the company

Stranger: close your eyes

Stranger: and they clone you

Stranger: there are now two yous, with your eyes both closed

Stranger: the important point is that the sensory input is identical

Stranger: are you the clone or not?

You: it's impossible to tell

Stranger: ues

Stranger: yes

Stranger: if your self-awareness didn't transfer

Stranger: the clone would be able to tell he is the clone

You: but i mean

You: if i kill me

You: my life is gone

You: while we are both alive

You: we have separate identities

You: we are the same person

You: be we are two lives

Stranger: yes

Stranger: once you do the cloning

Stranger: the lives then diverge

Stranger: this cloning and killing, however

Stranger: happens near-instantaneously

Stranger: the lives don't have any time to diverge

You: at the end of the day you still have a dead body

You: i still choose no

Stranger: the cloning company offers you this instead

Stranger: if you clone yourself, and then kill the clone

Stranger: you get a million dollars

Stranger: do you do it?

You: no

You: because if i chose yes my clone would kill me xD

Stranger: the clone would be killed as soon it was created

Stranger: instantly, and painlessly

You: would it ever be aware it ever existed?

Stranger: momentarily

You: would it know it is a clone based on it's new location?

You: or are the rooms identical?

Stranger: up to you

Stranger: does it influence the decision?

You: well yes

You: it does

You: because if i am aware i am the clone

You: i instantly realize why i have been made

You: and have little remorse for what is next

Stranger: wouldn't you be pleased?

Stranger: you're earning yourself a million dollars

Stranger: at the end of the day, you're walking into the cloning company by yourself

You: nah i pass i think the experience would be too traumatic to be worth a million

You: or any money

You: plus murder isn't really my m/o

Stranger: and you have the option of either leaving with a million dollars, or leaving without a million dollars

Stranger: murder isn't really accurate

Stranger: you're killing a body

Stranger: but your mind is quite intact

Stranger: since there are two bodies

Stranger: when you copy something off of a usb drive to your computer, you can go ahead and delete the copy on the usb drive

Stranger: they're identical

Stranger: you're not destroying the information

You: yes but data isn't conscious

Stranger: the cloning company offers to clone you

Stranger: no strings attached

Stranger: no killing or money

Stranger: do you do it?

You: is the clone my responsibility?

Stranger: not more than anyone else

Stranger: if you have a significant other, though

Stranger: consider that things are going to get real crowded, real fast

You: i think i would but i'd want us to go our separate ways more or less

You: also get tattoos

You: non matching

You: lol

Stranger: so you would make yourself cut yourself off from all of your friends and loved ones?

You: no not isolated

You: that what the tattoo are for

You: so we can hang out and stuff

You: on occassion

You: w/o stealing identities

Stranger: before you went to the cloning facility

Stranger: you killed someone

Stranger: and now you've been linked to the crime

Stranger: who goes to jail?

You: me and not the clone

You: the clone has yet to commit an act of crime

Stranger: so, back to earlier

Stranger: the you in france is guiltless

Stranger: and the you still at the teleporter is taken to jail?

You: yes

Stranger: but, what if the teleporter hadn't malfunctioned, and there was no copy of you left behind at the teleporter?

You: then the one teleported goes

You: the diffrence is

You: one is a new life

You: the other is the same life moved over a distance

Stranger: but, when the teleporter malfunctions,

Stranger: it's the copy left behind that goes to jail?

You: i guess it all depends on how the machine works

Stranger: the machine leaves the original you intact

Stranger: and arranges all of the matter correctly in france

Stranger: out of previously formless matter

Stranger: a block of lead, or something

You: can i just fly to france?

Stranger: according to the system where the copy in france is blameless

Stranger: if you kill someone

Stranger: then teleport to france

Stranger: then teleport back

Stranger: (with the teleporter working correctly both times)

Stranger: you're now guiltless

You: works for me   ((&lt;---I gave up at this point))

Stranger: when really pressed for it,

Stranger: you just don't really care about consistency

Stranger: which is really a negligent way to go about life

You: sounds good to me

Stranger: *I come from behind, lean on to the chair, move the hair falling on your ear and kiss your ear*

You: i tilt my head to the side to allow better access. i break out into a smile

Stranger: *I move down further and kiss your neck*

You: i reach up and hug your head tighter onto my neck

Stranger: I take off my shirt

Stranger: and come around to face you

Stranger: *I close my eyes and reach for your luscious lips*

You: i part my lips and lean into you

Stranger: I suck your tongue and move to let me lean against your body

You: i spread my legs to accomodate you, my skirt rides up to my waist revealing my pink thong

You: i push my tongue into you, trying to dance to tongue tango

You: but i don't know how to dance...will you teach me?

Stranger: i graze your thighs, upwards and upwards

Stranger: i don't know to, may be we could both try something

You: well i'll follow you're lead, studly

Stranger: *we both get up and stand facing each other*

You: i extend my tongue, awaiting the tongue handshake (tongueshake?) that probably is the start of the tongue tango

Stranger: i roll my tongue around yours

Stranger: trying not to part your mouth

You: oh baby i love that tongue. i do the same, trying to get that circular motion i've seen in the movies so many times

You: with my free hands, i unbutton my shirt and pull it off

Stranger: i stare at your boobs with wide eyes, i continue rolling my tongue around you, sucking your mouth

Stranger: i lift my hand to knead your breast

You: i playfully swat it away, but open my mouth and suck on your tongue hard

You: i touch the tip of my tongue to yours, and increase the suction

You: this is so amazing, i've never gotten this far in the tongue tango before. i excitedly moan

Stranger: i put my hand behind your head and pull you closer

You: i push my body against yours, and grasp the back of your head with both hands

You: i increase the suction even more, i bet you couldn't get your tongue out of my mouth if you tried

Stranger: i slowly lift my hand up, moving towards your breast

You: i want it deeper, deeper!

You: i push my breast into your hand, be rough with me

Stranger: i am running out of breath

You: that's because i'm sucking it up like a vacuum

Stranger: i knead it hard

Stranger: with my big warm rough hand

You: try breathing through your nose, and pulling at my nipples...

Stranger: we slowly move to the bed

Stranger: still kissing

You: i fall on top of you, straddling you with our faces still suction cupped together

Stranger: i push you away

Stranger: and take a deep breath

You: without your tongue to take the suction, my face scrunches up like i just ate 7 warheads and then a whole lemon

You: i look like a fish as i take off my skirt

Stranger: use your breathing skills else where love

You: i'm straddling you now in nothing but a black thong

You: but my hands are still struggling with the skirt, it's off but around my arms like handcuffs

Stranger: i help you take them out

You: my fish face contorts in confusion

You: finally, i understand what the problem is

You: my hands have transformed to match my face, and i struggle with them as if they are fins

Stranger: oh wow

You: it's very difficult, thanks for helping me get that off

You: now where were we?

Stranger: we need some water here

Stranger: i go to the kitchen and get a jar of water

You: baby, take off your pants and give me a golden shower, this fish needs to get even more wet ;)

Stranger: you love water dont you?

You: ohh yeah

Stranger: i put you in the jar

Stranger: and walk towards the restroom

You: i like where this is going

You: take off my thong for me, i can't reach my back fin with these little side-diddlies

Stranger: i throw the water along with you into the shitter

Stranger: and keep my hand at the flush tab

You: oh baby, i hope it's clean water

Stranger: i start to pee

You: yes! yes!

Stranger: and flush you down the toilet

Stranger: you get stuck

You: no, i go all the way down to the sewers. i start a new life as a small fish in a big sewer

You: i grow to beastly proportions

Stranger: no no

You: i become known to the locals as Row'tog, the Fallen One

Stranger: you die of coming into contact with dioxins

Not sure I 100% believe him but I give him the benefit of the doubt and chat for 20 minutes or so. 

We talk a bit about how easy it is to hack peoples computers on omegle or elswhere (which I had no idea about). Conversation gets slow so I tell him I'm going to go get a drink and he can leave if he wants. Last thing I say is not to hack my computer (jokingly) because I wasn't going to disconnect in case he still wanted to chat. Come back to my computer and my router has been disconnected from the internet and had to be reset. 

I don't even know how you do that remotely but I'm sure plenty of hackers do... Anyways, I don't know if he actually was one of anonymous and I don't know if he was just trolling but it was a little scary that if he wasn't bullshitting me he could have stolen all my personal info from my computer right then.
