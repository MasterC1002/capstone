I have recently been considering going back to school for a MA or Ph D. in Behavioral Econ. I'd like to spend some time volunteering in a relevant lab before I apply.  I've been poking around the web for a bit now and have yet to come across a definitive list of school's that offer a Behavioral Program.  I know the big ones but would like to know what else is out there and the scope of the research being done.

Has anyone seen/compiled something like this in their travels? Any info would be appreciated!

Edit: While I'm at it, I might as well ask if anyone knows any labs that are looking for research assistants as well. Econ grad with 3 years of ""real world"" experience in data analysis. Familiar with matlab, statistical analysis, and some basic programming.

For example, the authors propose that money given up in purchases is not generally subject to loss aversion. The results of several experiments provide preliminary support for the hypotheses. The authors find that, consistent with prospect theory, loss aversion provides a complete account of risk aversion for risks with equal probability to win or lose.

The imaginary charities can't take donations online or via post.  However they have plenty of stores near shops.  People can donate by popping in.

What do you think?  I know that Ariely wrote about deadlines, but I'm trying to get a better idea of how it affects donations specifically.  To make it clear, the deadlines are arbitrary.  The 1st is chosen because it's easy to remember.  The 7th will be used only if it's better for donations.  It doesn't matter *when* people donate, just as long as they do.

Please let me know if there's anything else I need to clarify.  I'm sure some of you experts can help. :)

Maybe if we bold the lines a little more and get rid of the axes labels, it will look nice like [/r/economics' logo](http://i.imgur.com/EbD6p.png).

Since the game is highly dependent on mental modeling, I would presume an individual with Asperger's would be less successful in making reasonable offers and also more willing to accept unreasonable offers, but I haven't found a study explicitly investigating these questions.
