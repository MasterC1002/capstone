The music copyright organization, GEMA, is getting ready to roll on a new plan; '‘average sized’ Berlin clubs currently paying €28,000 a year will have to pay €180,000'. This will effectively end the Berlin club and music scene. Please sign the petition, and make this stop.	Siinus	67	5	1		t5_2r5uc	False

http://www.reddit.com/r/Techno/comments/vztk9/a_feeling_i_know_all_too_well_xpost_from/

And as such, other posts similar to this one are popping up.

Generally I don't intervene in postings.  This is generally because the natural upvote/downvote filter takes care of most unrelated content, which I find works better because I'm not one to define what is or isn't Techno.  Techno is an indescribable genre, and while there is always debate as to what is techno, people voting know what isn't (certainly not that damned Leve5 song).  So when someone posts something that isn't techno, the natural system downvotes it into oblivion.

But seeing the ""popularity"" of this post, I think it's a good time to open a discussion on what this reddit is about.  **Firstly, Techno isn't a general term used to describe electronic music.**  If you haven't checked out our sidebar yet, go get informed.

I'm going to be blunt: **this reddit isn't a place to post half-hashed memes in order to gain some karma.**  There's other reddits for that.  And even if it is actually techno related, we could do better than to put some thoughtless picture so that we can feel satisfaction that people think alike.

So I ask you of /techno to keep this reddit content oriented.  The post in question will be removed in a day (probably after the 4th), and posts of this sort will be removed.  If anyone has an argument to why this may be unfair, feel free to leave comments below, and we can have an honest discussion on the topic.  Also, lets discuss things we would like to see in this reddit.  Personally I would love to see posts of techno events posted here.

--- And let's think about making some mixes! ---

**Edit 2:** And talking of mixes, the reason I was thinking about this; I made a mix about a week ago with loads of old favourites, mostly from the 90s. Check it out [here...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Techno/comments/w6ar7/any_love_for_some_90s_techno_lots_of_old/)

Just wanted to post the semi-obligatory ""Yay! We've reached x000 users!"" post.  

On a more personal level, I'd like to thank everyone who's been posting awesome tracks and sets here.  Over the last few years, the electronic music world has seen a sort of ""revival"" along with the unprecedented explosion of dubstep and bass music.  DnB is getting huge again.  New styles of house music are gaining incredible popularity and attracting masses of new listeners.  But techno has always been here.   I've always seen techno as sort of the ""serious"" electronic dance music subgenre - for the serious heads.  In most of the world, it's never seen the kind of breakaway success we're now seeing with bass music, but it has always been there.  Styles have come and gone but techno is still techno.  In every city there are at least a few heads who have been banging techno for years and refuse to move on, even though it doesn't draw the same huge crowds as the flavor-of-the-year EDM genre.  I have a lot of friends who I played techno with 10+ years ago who are still banging it out at small clubs/parties in their hometowns despite small turnouts and the frustrations that come along with it.  One of the upsides to this recent explosion in electronic music is that it's created tons of new and sound-hungry listeners who will eventually tire of dubstep/electrohouse/etc and sooner or later will have their ears stimulated by some proper techno on a proper sound system.  Personally I can't wait.   

I don't want to go on forever, but this seemed like a good time to remind everyone that techno is still alive and well, and you are all responsible for that.  Keep it up.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to receive any feedback anyone has for making this subreddit more attractive/useful/etc.  The sidebar hasn't been updated in a long while and I'm not sure if any of the other mods are active, so I wanted to let you all know that I'll be happy to take any suggestions for any of that stuff.  Also, if anyone has problems with their posts being throttled, I can add you to the approved submitters list and you can post techno to your heart's content.  

Feel free to share your stories about techno or anything else that you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.  Rock on! "	t5_2r5uc	True

A few friends and I have planned a small techno event at a very nice, very small venue, the ZGK in Friedrichshain. It's suitable for about 200-250 persons only, so we hope for a very familiar but intense atmosphere. 


The DJs playing will be 

spaceinvasion (https://soundcloud.com/spaceinvasion)

jay quentin (https://soundcloud.com/jayquentin)

phonatic (https://soundcloud.com/phonatic)


Music in the basement will be mostly dark and industrial Berlin/Detroit Techno (consult the soundcloud links to get an idea).   Upstairs we'll show black and white footage of 1920s industrial berlin and play some prerecorded ambient-techno sets for a more relaxed atmosphere


It's not for personal gain whatsoever, we do it for the love of techno and a good cause: We will donate parts of the profit to an anti-racist project, the rest will be used for the next event. Since we did have some expenses, we ask for a 5 Euro entrance fee. Drinks will also be low priced.

I often find myself at a loss for words when I try to explain to people what Techno is, especially since the term is almost always wrongly used as an all encompassing term for electronic music. 

This issue is further complicated  by the fact that *I'm* getting confused on what Techno actually is. It's obviously not the only type of music I enjoy, but Techno is definitely my favorite genre. 

Some tracks I would give people as an example of techno:

I hope this is the right subreddit for this kind of question.
I'm from the Netherlands and if I do say so myself we've got a pretty decent techno scene going on, especially in my city Rotterdam. But to get to my question: A while ago i first heard [Dominik Eulberg - drei millione musketeer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP9r4g4qfbc) and it has become my absolute favorite track. I follow my RA monthly top 50s etc, but i'm having trouble coming across some of these golden 'spacey' tunes. Please, please, post some. Actually, post all of them! 
All of my thanks!"	t5_2r5uc	True

His mixing just was not up to scratch. I feel he played too many novelty tracks such as Strings of Life and New Order. Now although strings of life is an absolute classic I feel he was just playing what was expected of him and didn't push the boat out at all. This was my first time seeing him play and of course I hyped the gig up to a few friends who haven't seen him play before either and they were quite disapointed. I honestly don't think I would ever go to hear him play again. Has anyone here seen him play before and what was your experience? 	t5_2r5uc	True

I'll be able digitize the tape as soon as I'm back to Berlin (~September), as I'm currently visiting some familymembers in the south.

I'm looking for articles or documentaries about techno in general, it can be about its roots, about techno nowadays, about some artists, about labels, about some sub-genres, about hardware, about clubs, etc. What do you recommend me to read/watch ?   

Actually I just would like to know more about this genre, I listen to quite a lot of techno tracks but I'd like to have a broader view of what it is. I know labels such as Drumcode, CLR, Ostgut Ton, Minus, Skryptom, etc, but I guess there are plenty of others. I don't really know exactly what the different subgenres are. And so many things I don't know yet.

I've been loving and enjoying Techno for quite a while. I also have been DJ'ing for 5 years now with some highs and lows. Lately, I've been noticing a steep decrease in bookings and feel that I need to bring something new for myself, so I'm looking into production.

I've played around with Ableton Live (my DAW of choice) for a bit (on and off through the years) and am comfortable using Operator, Simpler/Sampler, most FX and whatnot, but never been able to make something that I enjoy enough myself to play it, or even do something with it publicly. 

So I'm wondering, is there anyone here on Reddit that knows a proper tutorial link (most Youtube stuff I've seen don't really go into the creation of modern techno, and fall back to 140 BPM bass/hihat-only tracks, which is not what I like) or some place I can go for some great pointers to start out. 

Thank you sincerely!"	t5_2r5uc	True

 I've seen the documentaries and know it's history, but when i listen to some of the ""classic"" tracks from detroit, many of them have very little in common with what I'd call techno (and from seeing the posts on reddit, what everyone else would call techno). I can hear some influences for sure, but really the only thing that allows me to classify a track as detroit is how old it sounds.

As the title says, I'm new to Techno. So far really liking it! I realised there are many different styles to it, and have a hard time finding out where I should start.

I'm looking for more stuff like these:

- [Hobo - Incise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVTlmU9pjjI)

- [Mr. Oizo - Flat Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEfdGRqDH8)

Most of them I heard from Icicle's podcasts, as I listen to a lot of Drum &amp; Bass, and he produces Techno and Dubstep as well (which I both really enjoy).

Do excuse if some of them aren't even considered Techno, I was hoping someone could rule those out.

So last night I was at the Dekmantel show at ADE and saw Silent Servant, Sandwell District and Luke Slater tear the roof off and it still makes me feel great about life (and energises me) almost 24 hours later. A real (drugless) 'dance yourself clean' night.

Since I cannot derive pleasure from things until I've overanalysed them to death I was wondering why. Maybe your input can help.

So: why does dancing to intensely repetitive music, in a big warehouse filled with a lot of loveable weirdos on drugs make you feel so damn good?"	t5_2r5uc	True

More like where to put certain drums, how to build up tension etc...
I make music with Reason, but the kind of advice i seek should be applicable for any program.

Also, if this is not the correct subreddit, please feel free to propose something more inicated.

Thanks for your advice!"	t5_2r5uc	True

We (the moderators) recently got a request from a user to update the links on the sidebar.  When I updated the CSS a few months ago I didn't do much work to the actual content, just the stylesheet.  Soooo...  

We'd like everyone to post what they consider to be good/popular/recommended:

*  labels
*  artist pages
*  podcasts
*  blogs
*  top 10 lists etc.
*  documentaries / historical docs

Please also upvote ones that you agree with that have already been posted.  If we get enough participation, we can pick the most popular ones.  If not, we can just add a bunch of stuff to the sidebar.  

In addition, please feel free to recommend anything else that should go on the sidebar that doesn't fall into these categories, or recommend other design/style changes for the subreddit.  

Cheers-

r/techno mods

EDIT:  Thanks all for the recommendations.  The sidebar now has about 2x the content.  I've tried to put up all the most relevant stuff without making it a mile long.  But please keep the suggestions and votes coming!  :)"	t5_2r5uc	True

At our parties, we start with decent techno right from the beginning and people seem to like it. But most of the other promoters/organizers around here insist in having the first 1-2 djs playing minimal/tech-housy stuff.

My experience is, that most people don't like that. At least the one i asked or talked about that with. The result seems to be that the majority of the crowd joins the party at about 2-3 hours in.



So, i'm really curious: what do you think about that? And why?

Right now [Voices from the Lake](http://soundcloud.com/prologue/prgcd001-voices-from-the-lake) comes to mind. I could also go for a couple Plastikman tracks from the late 90's.

Someone suggested to mix all of the tracks together, so I though I could have a try at it. 
Since there was so many tracks and I don't have time to record such a long mix in one go I decided to do the mix in two parts. This mix contains the tracks with bpm between 120-130, the second mix will contain the tracks with higher bpm.

It was a nice challenge to mix tracks of some quite different styles, and some of the transitions are a bit dodgy, but I hope you will enjoy it anyway!
I will try to put up the second part soon.
