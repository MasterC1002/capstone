It is only as accurate as our ability to anticipate every failure mode and assign it a precise probability based on a paper design. It pushes the designer to make every system redundant, adding weight and cost which often serve no purpose. This also explains why NASA feels ""safer"" putting a crew on the second SLS launch than on the tenth Falcon. But the NASA strategy is based on a false premise. In reality most launch vehicle losses are due to failure modes that are not anticipated anywhere in the design process and can be discovered only by repeated testing in actual flight. The solution is not redundancy, but correction of the original flaw in the design. In fact, the O-ring that failed in Challenger was redundant, and thus, by NASA methods, infallible. Thus for launch vehicles at least, the approach taken by SpaceX and ULA under SAAs for the Falcon and Atlas, to fly at least ten missions (and correct any design flaws that are revealed) before putting a crew on a launch vehicle is actually considerably safer, and the ASAP premise the ""NASA quality control"" strategy leads to safety and industry strategies do not, does not appear consistent with the historical record."	t5_2qsj9	True

For me it really illustrates how NASA, even in its heyday, was not a perfect organization and that bad decisions could (and were) made regularly. Humanizes their efforts and I'm sure connects with a lot of engineers out there about their own struggles in the workplace.

First paragraph

Dear Dr. Seamans:

Somewhat as a voice in the wilderness, I would like to pass on a few thoughts 
on matters that have been of deep concern to me over recent months. This concern 
may be phrased in terms of two questions: (1) If you were told that we can put man 
on the moon with safe return with a single C-3, its equivalent or something less, 
would you judge this statement with the critical skepticism that others have? (2) Is 
the establishment of a sound booster program really so difficult?"	t5_2qsj9	True

1) When the spacewalkers are talking to mission control, they talk to the capcom, who's usually an astronaut, in the current case Mike Fincke. In my understanding the capcom is not a ""decision-maker"", just a guy to relay information from the ground up to space. But he's seems to respond to questions from the astros fairly quickly, as if he's able to make the call or decision immediately without waiting for orders from other flight controllers or whatever. That seems to be the opposite of what we saw in the film ""Apollo 13"", where the capcoms were nearly always shown getting information from the flight director before relaying up to space. So do the current capcoms not wait for orders before speaking to the astros?

2)  Do the Houston flight controls ever go through a shift change in the middle of an EVA? This EVA was scheduled at the last minute.  How did that line up with the ground control shift schedule?"	t5_2qsj9	True

Manuito	23	1	12	"I was wondering if (apart from Voyager 1 and 2, which are escaping the solar system) there are any satellites orbiting the Sun over or under the plane of the planets (not taking Pluto into account).

When we send a satellite to a distant planet, does it normally travel all the way on that same planet's plane around the Sun, or does it make any kind of shortcut by going over or under it?

Do we have any satellite orbiting the Sun that could take a picture from ""above"" or ""below"" the solar system in which different planets would be visible?

I hope I could explain myself correctly and that I'm not saying anything completely ridiculous.

Many thanks!"	t5_2qsj9	True

I write today to ask for your help. You may have heard that this year is the Space Needle's 50th anniversary. To celebrate, they are holding a Space Race competition, the grand prize of which is a real trip to outer space. Part of the competition was to create a 2-minute video entry explaining why I want to go to space. Today I was selected as a finalist. To move on to the next round I need everyone with a working mouse finger to vote for my video on the Space Needle's Facebook page: http://apps.facebook.com/spaceracecompetition/entries/122?ref=nf — my video is titled ""Young Astronauts."" Can you help me go to space by spreading the word faster than anyone else on the internet that a free speech enthusiast also has a chance to be an astronaut? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I would be tremendously grateful for any help or support you could give.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Yours truly, Gregory

    The above schedule is a composite of unclassified information
    approved for public release from government, industry, and other
    sources. It represents the Editor's best effort to produce a schedule,
    but may disagree with other sources. Details on military launches are
    withheld until they are approved for public release. For official
    information regarding Vandenberg AFB activities, go to
    http://www.vandenberg.af.mil.
    
    All launch dates and times are given in Pacific Time using a 24-hour
    format similar to military time (midnight = 00:00, 1:00 p.m. = 13:00,
    11:00 p.m. = 23:00, etc.). 
    
    The dates and times in this schedule may not agree with those on other
    online launch schedules, including the official Vandenberg AFB
    schedule because different sources were used, the information was
    interpreted differently, and the schedules were updated at different
    times.

I've seen this far too many times in the past week for me to remain silent on this topic. Let's say an article is posted about the future of the space program, or maybe just the topic is brought up in a thread. Someone at some point then proceeds to rant about how the moon landings were a hoax, and it's all a load of bullshit. I feel the need to understand how it's possible that you hold that belief. I'm not interested in being a dick, if anything I'm hoping that after explaining your position, there can be some good discussion about the points you bring up.

Discuss.

SLS - [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System)

[EDIT] - Everyone's input has been insightful, thanks. It is clear to me now that commercial spaceflight to LEO and SLS are not as comparable as I initially thought. In the interest of fairness, *is* there a good argument for going forward with this jobs program?

If SLS's mission is to be a deep space exploration launch vehicle then do you believe that that mission will be best accomplished by this type of vehicle? What's so wrong about funding research into something like Ad Astra's VASIMR? Is it too much to ask that instead of making a conventional rocket that NASA contractors already know how to make, we make a mission in which the purpose is to *actually* further interplanetary spaceflight and then find some way for these contractors to contribute to that endeavor? Or is that too much like having your cake and eating it too?"	t5_2qsj9	True

1327426885.0	ouoyf	Question: I'd like to watch a rocket launched into space from the continental U.S. I've researched it as best I can, but would like guidance from someone who knows more about it. Many more specific questions within.	bigmapblog	19	3	16	"*(Originally posted this question to [AskMetafilter](http://ask.metafilter.com/134863/I-would-like-to-see-a-rocket-launched-into-space) a few years ago.  Got some good info from that thread, but would like to hear some more opinions. Crossposting this question to [/r/NASA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/ououf/question_id_like_to_watch_a_rocket_launched_into/), [/r/aerospace](http://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/ouoxm/question_id_like_to_watch_a_rocket_launched_into/), and [/r/spaceflight](http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceflight/comments/ouoyf/question_id_like_to_watch_a_rocket_launched_into/).)*

&gt;I'm in St. Louis, Missouri, and I'd like to keep my travel time/expense to a minimum. That said, I'd like to do it right and see the most awesome rocket launch that I can, and see it in the best possible way.

&gt;**I'm currently making the following assumptions. Please feel free to correct them; they may very likely be wrong**:

&gt;* If I want to watch a launch in the Continental U.S., I must choose between [Cape Canaveral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station) in Florida and [Vandenberg Air Force Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base) in California.
&gt;* The launch platforms I have to choose from are: [Minotaur I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_%28rocket%29), [Taurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_%28rocket%29), [Atlas V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V), ~~Delta II~~, [Delta IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV), and ~~the Space Shuttle~~.
&gt;* This wikipedia [list of 2012 launches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_in_spaceflight) contains a full and complete listing of (U.S., continental) launches that will happen this year.

&gt;I have no preference for manned vs. unmanned, and am not favoring launches with any historical import – I am only wanting to see the most visually impressive launch that I can.

&gt;Am I correct in assuming that I want to be as close as is possible? NASA provides [instructions on good public viewing positions](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/viewing.html), but I'd like to be closer, if possible. (Ideally, I'd love a view like [this one](http://www.launchphotography.com/GLAST_2.jpg) if possible.) Who do I schmooze in order to get the best seats in the house? (I'm guessing that the CEO of *SatelliteMegaCorp* isn't watching the launch with binoculars from his pickup bed on the state highway...) Could choosing a poorly-attended launch help my chances of getting closer? Do different launch providers have different policies on this?

&gt;What are the differences in appearance of the various launch platforms? Is bigger better? If so, what's the closest-modern-equivalent to the Saturn V? Are launches to [GTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_transfer_orbit) *cooler looking* than launches to [LEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit)? (Forgive all of this if they are foolish questions... I have no idea).

&gt;What am I not asking that I should be? I know there must be an enthusiast community for such things (kindred spirits to Railfans and Roadgeeks), but I'm not finding any online. Do you know of any (are you one?). Many thanks."	t5_2qsj9	True

It allows you to plug in the mass, thrust and isp values for a rocket and the target orbit and it will give you an estimate of the launcher's performance. 

Using it I've estimated the launch performance of the following rockets: 

Ariane 6: 16-18 tons to LEO, about 7 tons to GTO

Falcon 9v1.1: 14.1 tons to LEO

Falcon Heavy (no crossfeed): 33.7 tons to LEO, 11 tons to GTO

Falcon Heavy w/ crossfeed: 42.1 tons to LEO, 15 tons to GTO

Ariane 5 without boosters and extra Vulcains: 13 tons to LEO.

It's a nice little tool for those interested in Aerospace engineering. Hope you enjoy it!"	t5_2qsj9	True
