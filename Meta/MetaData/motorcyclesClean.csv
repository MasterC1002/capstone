We need some help.	psychoholic	3192	859	436	"I'm going to make this a self post so there is no karma to be had -I'm just seeking some guidance from the community at large here, any wisdom you guys can give to this situation will be well appreciated.  

Super short version of the story - A student at the University of Arizona, with a full ride golf scholarship, was drunk and I believe without a valid license, plowed into a friend of a friend on his Harley and put him in the hospital in a pretty bad shape  (pic [here](http://i.imgur.com/I6yax.jpg) - warning, it's not pretty).  Then she skipped her arraignment for her 3 felonies and 3 misdemeanors and went to switzerland with her apparently rich parents.  

Fast forward to a year later and she is trying to clean up her online image and her mother has been harassing any webhost that even mentions the story or her name in a negative light (one of the sites resides on my server and she called the abuse department for our host more than 30 times in a single day, called the CEO, called the legal folks, etc and wouldn't stop badgering them until we were forced to take the forum private).  All of the facebook pages to bring attention were shut down, all of the sites mentioning what she had done were taken down and only a few news sites remain.  His offspring (I assume son) posted about it a year ago here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/nnid4/please_help_spread_the_word_about_a_swiss_golfer/

You can get her name from this article (I'm not posting it directly here so it doesn't show up in google):

http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_d9a1934f-1614-5dc1-8f93-b4046f412bf7.html

It is my understanding that the family has not received any money from her family at all and the medical bills were immense (apparently the VA doesn't pay medical real well either, despite a career in the military).

This is some of the personal account from the gentleman who was hit:

*I was hit on the left side of my bike. I remember seeing the car coming at me, trying to swerve to avoid contact and waking up in (I think) the ER. The witnesses at the scene said they helped me get Lucille off of me, and that I tried three times to stand up. I still don't know if I succeeded the third time.*

* From the ground up, I had the following injuries (all on left side):
* Broken ankle
* large gash in my knee cap
* broken ribs
* broken pinky finger (required surgery)
* puncture wound to my wrist
* strained muscles in my shoulder
* injury to my jaw causing severe TMJ
* Broken nose
* broken facial bones between my eyes and mouth
* Damaged optic nerve
* gash on my head
* Traumatic brain injury

*At one time, I was seeing 13 doctors for all of my injuries.*

*Currently, I'm still dealing with the jaw, the shoulder, the ankle hurts when the weather changes, I've lost 75% of the peripheral vision on my left side and my memory and concentration aren't so good.*

*After she hit me, she left the scene and went for food. She was close enough to watch everything unfold (people helping get the bike off me, ambulance pick me up..etc) and when the police finally got her and mentioned my condition, her response was ""Oh, he'll be alright, I'm worried about my scholarship"".*

Thanks in advance Rideit! 

Please don't post her name in this thread at all, I'd really rather get some wisdom on the subject without their interference again.

EDIT:  Thanks for all the responses and exposure thusfar.  If you want a real clue into how she handled this situation, the crash report is a great source of reading (which of course is public record).  The supplemental narrative bit by the officers really paints a *lovely* picture of this girl.  http://bit.ly/ZPfZnL

EDIT 2:  To save you some time, some of the finer points from the police report:

* 6 out of 6 intoxicated clues observed, including vertical nystagmus
* She asked to speak to her father who was an attorney, she talked to someone for 15-20 minutes on the phone in the back of the police car, asked again if she could talk to her father who was an attorney, when the officer said that she had just had the conversation she said she hadn't talked to anyone and denied talking on the phone (despite being observed talking on the phone), got father on the phone, he said he was NOT an attorney.
*  Officer observed her 'I don't care attitude'
*  Officer quoted her saying ""Well, He'll be fine.  I'm just worried that this doesn't affect my golf scholarship""
*  Answered 'Yes' and 'Sure' to her Miranda rights
*  Denied she had any alcohol, officer also heard her tell someone on the phone ""I only had 2 drinks!""

EDIT 3:  It should also be mentioned that the point of this post and our general campaign isn't about money at all, it's about justice.  We want her to answer in a court of law for her crimes and to be punished in accordance with those same laws.

1370419391.0	1fpkb6	I had someone throw trash at me today, and got instant redemption...	jethanr	2671	708	482	"This is a long story, but I had to share.

So I was riding along on my way home from work. My commute is mostly two-lane rural highway that connects two satellite cities outside of Nashville, Tennessee. I'm putting along at the posted speed limit, when I come up behind an SUV going about 40mph. I figure, hey, they're probably driving down this road for the first time, it's a twisty road, I can understand going slow. But after a while I see that their speed is fluctuating like crazy, from the aforementioned 40 to 60 then back to 40, over the course of maybe two miles. The driver would also swerve occasionally, and being that it's 11 p.m. at night, I'm figuring there's a good chance it's a drunk driver; regardless, I'm looking for ways around this guy. 

Well, I keep my distance until I get to a part of the highway that opens up to four lanes as I roll out of the ""country"" and into the city. The SUV gets over in the right lane, and I start to pull ahead in the left lane to get past the guy. Then he starts to swerve a bit into my lane, and I react by falling back a bit, he gets back in his lane, and I kick it down a gear and get ready to fly by this guy before something bad happens.

Well, as I'm pulling past him, he accelerates so that for a moment, I'm right beside his window; lo and behold, it's a sub-20 year old kid staring down at his phone. As I'm looking at him, he looks up from his phone and seems a little freaked out that I'm there, and despite all those pre-situation thoughts of shaking my head, motioning for him to put the phone down, whatever, I just open up the throttle and get the hell out of there.

I could tell that the kid sped up once I got past him, because he wasn't really drifting away in my mirror. I'm getting closer to home now and there are stop lights ahead. I caught the first one green, but as soon as I saw the second set of stop lights they turned yellow, and with the kid only about 150 feet behind me, I have to stop. 

So, the kid pulls up beside me, and I'm trying not to look at him. I'm just hoping the light turns green soon. I know I can beat him off the line with ease and I just want space between me and this kid; something doesn't feel right. Well, while I'm keeping my eyes forward, I hear ""Hey, dude. What the fuck, man? What's your deal?"" but I ignore it. I hear ""Hey, faggot, you fucker!"" but I still ignore it. *Come on, light. Green, now* is all I'm thinking. Then, all of a sudden I hear this sort of thud against my helmet, and I can feel really cold liquid on my neck. I look down by my right boot, and there's a fucking McDonald's cup sitting there with ice and soda coming out. I'm raging at this point in my head. I look at the kid, and he throws a wadded up paper bag or something at me. I don't know what he thought it'd accomplish aside from pissing me off; but it definitely did that.

At that point, I realize that I've put the bike in neutral and my left foot is reaching for the kickstand. I know, terrible reaction, but it's what I did, and I was fucking committed to it. 

But luckily, I didn't have time to do anything; As my toes connect with the kickstand, I see blue lights start flashing against the shiny paint of this kid's car. I look to my left; there's a cop! He's sitting in the parking lot of the gas station at the corner of the intersection directly to my left. The cop peels to his right, does a U-turn, and is behind the kid with his lights flashing. I'm thinking ""FUCK YES! DREAM COME TRUE."" 

I look back at the cop and wave at him, he lifts a hand while on his phone/walkie/whatever it is. He gets out of the squad car, and as he's walking to me, asks me if I can get over to the side, I say ""yes, can I dismount on the shoulder?"" and the officer says yes, just stay by the bike with the keys out of the ignition. So I do. He walks over to me after asking for the kid's papers or whatever and talking to him for a second, asks if I'm okay, asks if I know the kid, if I did anything to provoke him, and I tell the officer politely that I'm okay and that no I don't know him, I saw him playing with his phone while driving and did my best to get past him, and that in doing so I must have upset him. The cop says, ""are you sure you aren't friends? Because littering is a $250 minimum fine on this highway, and unless it was just a joke between friends, he's getting two tickets for littering tonight."" I tell the officer that that satisfies me completely, I thank him, and he says I can go as he returns to his cruiser. I get back on the bike, start it up, and look directly behind me at the kid who's freaking the hell out with his head in his hands. I revved the engine a bit to get the kid's attention; he looks up. I wave at the kid, flick the bike into first gear, and roll away. 

I was smiling the whole way home. 

May karma be as instantaneous and satisfying to you as it was to me this evening. Sorry to be so long-winded!

TL;DR: asshole teenager in a cage that I caught playing with his phone throws assorted garbage at me, cop sees it, kid gets a ticket for littering.

I'm reading about people caring weapons, bits of ceramic, brass knuckles, window punch tools, hammers, etc..

Look, you have every right to carry this stuff for your protection. But I need to tell you about my buddy who threw ceramics at a car that accidentally cut him off.

19 years old, upstate NY, casual-to-aggressive rider. Riding down RT84 towards CT. We were going faster then traffic, and a car pulled into the left lane without looking and my buddy ended up on the left shoulder. He pinned the throttle and pulled ahead of the driver.

...He was pissed, as we all would have been. What he did next was uncalled for, he pulled the ceramics out of his jacket pocket and let the bike slow down. Threw them at the left side of the car shattering the front and back driver side windows instantly. The driver freaked out and leaned into the passenger seat when the glass exploded while still trying to hold the steering wheel.

She ended up running him off the road and spinning the car out on the median grass. His bike was totaled but luckily he walked away from the wreck with no broken bones.

It could have been much worse, but when I see all these posts about how carrying ""defensive"" items while riding will make you safer. I'd argue that above all else, a high level of training at defensive motorcycle operation is your best method for keeping yourself low on the ladder of risk, and making sure you come home to your family after a ride, and stay out of courts/jail/hospital/morgue.

One last point. Motorcycle police can be our best role model. If they wouldn't carry, or do something... then you shouldn't either. They put on more miles then any of us, and have seen it all, and have been in incredibly dangerous situations.

Carry a gun if you want... that's fine, I encourage legal, responsible gun ownership and operation, but don't lose your cool. It's not worth your legal record, or your life.

And keep your ceramics and hammers at home... that's just thug bullshit.

Sorry for the rant. We have some young riders on here and I don't want this community to be a negative influence to them.

I was riding the 22 miles home, when I noticed a fellow biker in my mirror. Quite often, other motorcyclists pass me, as I am a reasonably new rider, and am not quite as confident overtaking as some other bikers seem to be (some people seem to spend all their time on the white lines).

Anyway, I move my position over a bit, so he could pass me if he chose, however after a few minutes I figured he wasn't bothered. 

He followed close behind me, always passing when I did, for roughly 10 miles. I can't explain it, but you get some kind of connection with someone when this happens, maybe because I don't have any friends who ride, so its a rare opportunity to have a riding brother, but that 15 minutes was probably some of the most enjoyable riding I have done since I started.

We parted ways at a roundabout, and he came along side me in his lane. I gave a thumbs up, and he honked his horn. I have no idea who he is, and will probably never see him again, but the fact we had 2 wheels in common seemed to be enough of a reason for him to stick with me all that time.

Just thought i'd share that boring story with all my other internet bros.

Ride safe.

I was browsing craigslist motorcycles (i'm pretty sure we all do that even though we have bike, or two, or more), saw it and was like, hey same mirrors, hey same... tail lights.... same missing WTF! THATS MY BIKE!   
I called the cops this morning to let them know I was pretty sure that it was my bike. They told me they'd get back to me so I was watching my phone like a hawk.  They called this afternoon and I went with them to identify the bike.  They acted like normal buyers, checked it out, and eventually told the sellers they were cops. At this point we were just sitting around the corner and we could see their heads over the bushes. We knew when they told them they were cops because the hands went straight up! lol  
 
So I eventually looked at the bike confirmed it was mine through some scuffs and parts that I added.

Feels good to know they are going to get what they deserve!

Insydemahed	1134	207	407	"So I'm riding my CBR250r lane splitting on my way to work as per usual, when there's construction up ahead and the two lanes merge into one. There's a bike behind me and I had started speeding up, which I usually do. But as I'm entering the merge, I suddenly see a bike cop pass in the opposite direction and he turns his head towards me and I see his lights come on.

I'm thinking oh man maybe I was going too fast or something and I slow down and slide behind the Mercedes SUV that I was right next to.

I think I'm safe then he literally pulls up right next to me, and says ""How's it going?"" It's a red light by the way.

- ""Good."" And I nod my head per biker etiquette.

- ""oh wow I didn't know they made a 250?!""

- ""oh yeah, they came out in 2011.""

- ""Must be good on gas?!""

-""yeah, almost 80mpg sometimes.""

-""right on man!""

Light turns green.

He turns on his lights and says, ""So I gotta pull this guy over, (points at the Mercedes SUV), you can pass.""

I nod and ride away, thinking that was probably the weirdest exchange I've ever had with a bike cop. The bike behind me slows down and stops lane splitting, probably because he didn't know what me and the cop were just talking about.

tl;dr Bike cops are cool sometimes

I've been riding about 4 months now but commute everyday so I've already racked up about 5,000 miles. When I first started riding I read a thread ""new rider advice"" where someone on here said something that really stuck with me (i've tried to search the thread but can't find it)... it was something to the effect of ""whenever you see one piece of debris there is usually always more to follow"". Well this morning those words rang true.

Given I was p̶r̶o̶b̶a̶b̶l̶y̶ definitely going too fast, cruising in the #1 lane at about 85mph when I see a box spring in the #4 lane, so many lanes over it was not a threat so for a second I didn't think anything of it, but then that advice immediately came to mind, so I let off the gas and covered my brakes, in those 2 seconds I probably shaved off 25mph+ just from engine braking which is a good thing because a split second later the car in front of me swerves onto the shoulder and BOOM, queen size mattress covering the entire fast lane. I emergency braked down to about 25mph when I realized I was going to hit so let off the brakes and swerved into the shoulder, missing the mattress by literally inches. 

Whoever you are, THANK YOU.

Chrisbergman23	1014	195	248	"A van pulled out not looking, and he collided into it. I imagine he didn't have enough time to maneuver out of the way. He was on his way to work. He was unresponsive when the paramedics arrived. On the way to the hospital his heart stopped. They cut open his chest and his pericardium was filled with blood. His  pulmonary artery to his lungs ruptured and he couldn't be saved. My dad died because the stupidity of another. Please remember to look out for motorcyclist and ride safe. Here is a photo of him http://i.imgur.com/eFXbD.jpg His name was Jeffrey Allen Bergman age 51 and I am his son Christopher Allen Bergman age 18.

Here is a picture of our dual sports together, I hope one day we can ride again http://i.imgur.com/CNVIn.jpg

The story can be seen here http://www.whittierdailynews.com/crime/ci_20069678

This was at the crash sight last night http://i.imgur.com/Q15mn.jpg

He was a great father, my role model, my inspiration, and my best friend. He taught me to be a good person, to ride motorcycles, to fly hang gliders,to conquer my fears, to strive for greatness, to have a different outlook on life, to fix cars, to build anything i could imagine. He was always there for me and i could not ask for a better dad. I'm going to remember him always and I hope justice will be served for his death. 

Thank you for all your support everyone, its nice to have people that understand.

Edit: I woke up this morning and wanted to ride. Something was telling me that it is what he would of wanted. So i got up, put on my gear, packed his gloves he was wearing yesterday, and headed up to the cleveland national forest on my dual sport. My father and I rode up there a lot together, where he taught me so much about riding. There were so many great memories, beautiful memories of us together. As i was riding I could here his voice telling me what a good rider I have become. When I got to the top the clouds were rolling over the top of the mountain and the sun was bright and warm. I wish he could be there with me, but in a way he was.

Your condolences have helped me more than you can believe and helped me to get right back on my motorcycle. Thank you, everyone.

1364321860.0	1b20dl	Used Motorcycle Buying Guide	BengNY	880	113	195	"So I decided to write this up after checking out yet another POS bike from a seller.  Buying a used bike is a great route for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a new ride.  These are the things I've learned to look for over the years and I hope it helps someone.

**Trust no one.**  I've bought bikes with major undisclosed issues from guys I thought were trustworthy and great no hassle bikes from guys who came off as really sketchy. 

**Never feel pressured** to not go through the list below. Print it off because you will forget things in the moment.  Buying a bike is high stress.  You're excited about the bike, he wants to sell it, you have a wad of cash in your pocket and want to make sure you're not getting screwed.

**Dealbreakers**:  Walk away if...
**1**:The title is not in the sellers name.
**2**:The Vin on the engine doesn't match the vin on the frame doesn't match the vin on the title (People below point out that the engine matching may not apply to certain makes).
**3**:The title is a salvage/ rebuild.
**4**:The bike doesn't run.  Trust me, if all it needed was a battery, the seller could've gotten one and sold the bike for much more.  Even if he jumps it and it runs (charging system may be frying every new battery for example).
**5**:The bike is warmed up (see below).

**Battery**.  Before doing anything get out your meter and measure the battery voltage.  Should be around 12.5-12.7.

**Cold Start**.  I tell every seller before coming over not to warm it up.  You want to see this baby from dead cold.  You never know what kind of coaxing the seller did right before you arrived.  Verify the headers are cool, then start it.

**Equal Pressure**.  Not the most important but while the bike is warming up I feel the exhaust and make sure they're about equal.  On one of my older bikes when the sync slips its obvious which one is firing better.

**Engine Noise**.  Listen for valve/ timing chain chatter.  Youtube can give you good examples.  On some bikes a little chatter is normal during warmup but it should go away.  Older hondas have a  louder top end than modern bikes.  A *very general* rule of thumb is the top end should sound like a sewing machine. 

**Revving**.  Once the bike is warm give the throttle a few blips. It should go *quickly* back to idle.  

**Charging System**.  Hook the meter up to the battery.  At idle it should be around 13-14.5v depending on the bike.  Some bikes don't charge until 1.5krpm -2krpm. Rev it to above 3krpm and it should DROP a bit.  The dropping indicates the voltage regulator is working.  It should never charge hotter than 15v. If you don't have a meter do this while watching the headlight.  The light should have the same brightness throughout the whole test.  

**Brakes**.  Check disc brakes by looking at the wear indicator on the pad, it will be a little groove in the middle of the pad.  Run a fingernail along the rotor, some roughness is normal but you shouldn't be able to catch you nail.    Check drum brakes by depressing lever and looking at the stamped wear indicator where the pivot comes out of the drum.  

**Clutch**. Ease of pull is pretty important if you don't want a sore left hand after 10 minutes.  During the test ride the bike should quickly engage when you let out the clutch; if it hangs for a bit thats a bad sign.  Get into a higher gear and open the throttle wide to stress the clutch a bit, if it slips and the RPMs go up while losing power that's a bad sign.

**Forks**.  Hold the front brake and depress the forks.  If you can depress them all the way just with your body they're dead.  Look for oil residue on the forks after you depress them.  This would indicate a bad fork seal.

**Tires**. Kicking them is a great way to look naive.  Look for dry rot on the sidewalls or in the treads.  Treads should pass the penny test, stick a penny in the tread, it should reach lincolns upside down head.  

**Fuel tank**.  Open up the fuel tank and look for visible rust.   A flashlight is handy for this.  Small rust spots are fairly normal in older bikes.  Rust spots bigger than a pencil eraser, or that look flaky or crumbly are not so good (if the fuel is low enough go ahead and stick a finger in there and give it a wipe).  A fuel filter on the bike is a good sign you need to look in the tank.  

**Chain/ Belt**. Check chain or belt for vertical travel in the drive and return  section.  Should be about 1 inch in the middle section.  Pull a few links off the rear sprocket, should have about 1/4inch clearance.  For both the chain and belt look at the axle tensioners on the back of the swing arm, they should have plenty of tightening room left.  If they're all the way at the end, the chain/belt is stretched to the end of its life.  For the belt look for cracks although I don't know what the tolerance is for a cracking belt.  Shaft drives are fairly maintenance free, just make sure they turn freely.  

**Sprocket**.  Look for worn teeth.  In very general terms they'll be asymmetric, have lobed teeth, or look kind of pointy instead of nubby.  

**Electrical**.  Straightforward.  Hit all the buttons and brake levers and they should do their job.

**Test Ride**.  If you make it this far you should be ready to buy because some sellers ask for the cash in hand to take a ride.  Don't buy a bike without riding it, you can tell so much from the ride.  The throttle is the most obvious: a jerky, sputtering spot in the throttle means the bike has been improperly jetted/mapped or the fueling system needs a good clean.  Listen for weird noises.  A regular grinding could be a stiff link in the chain.  A loud regular squeek could be a bearing catching.  Look down at the speedo and tach.  Jumpy? Way off? Lastly make sure you like the feel, ergonomics and performance.  

The above, excluding the dealbreakers, may not keep you from buying that bike.  If you feel comfortable replacing a set of tires or cleaning a carb go for it.  But at least you can be aware of the issue and be sure the price is adjusted accordingly.

Please add anything I missed or your own experiences!

**tl;dr:** If you're thinking of buying a used bike read above.

**Edit/Afterward**: Some very valid points brought up in the comments! 

[Tirecodes](http://www.barrystiretech.com/dotcoding.html) May come in handy!

Be Considerate! Sellers are generally good people its too bad a few bad ones means you have to watch out.  The bike is still *his property* so you should ask before doing any of the above.  If he doesn't want you unscrewing a bolt or something, that's his right.

This guide is aimed at inexperienced buyers looking for a reliable ride, or at least be informed enough to recognize when something needs attention.  Project bikes are a whole different breed:  Salvage titles, bikes that *kind of* run and come with 2.5 engines, etc are all good if that's what you're looking for.  

Regarding the vin/engine number matching this may not apply to your bike.

I know all it takes is one hit from my car to your motorcycle and you will become another highway death statistic, and the last fucking thing I want is to be in any way responsible for the death of another individual. That is why I am extra careful around motorcycles. I always check my blind spot before changing lanes. When I checked I saw you riding your two lanes to my right, directly in my blind spot. There was no one in front of you and no reason for you to change lanes. Just in case I put my blinker on and started to change lanes. I decided to be extra safe and check my blind spot again. And there you were in my blind spot accelerating into the fucking kill zone. All it takes is one bump from the side of my car to knock you off your bike. At 60mph with that half helmet and plenty of cars behind us chances are you'd be dead or wishing you were dead. I jerked back into my lane and watched as you gradually passed and then looked at me. I have no idea what was going through your head, but unless next time you want it to be the pavement pay attention to other motorists, their blinkers, and their blind spots. If I didn't see you two lanes over, I wouldn't have double checked my blind spot, if I didn't double check my blind spot you would be dead. Not everyone does all those steps, so next time don't fucking change lanes into a lane that a car with its blinker on is already moving into. Sharing the road goes both ways, not just expecting everyone to get out of your way, but keeping yourself out of harms way. Sorry to all you safe motorists out there, I just needed to vent in a way that will keep people alive after almost taking some moron's life. 	t5_2qi6d	True

He was wearing a helmet, tank top, shorts and tennis shoes, and riding a really messed up cbr600r. No fairings, plastic all scratched and just generally fucked up. 

At first he exchanged a nod with me, but then saw the 250r decal on my bike. He starts calling me a girl and that I should grow a pair, and just generally insults with no thought behind them. I respond with a simple, ""you like riding, I like riding. Engine size doesnt matter, lets just have fun."" he responds with a laugh. The light turns green and he says ""ladies first"". So i pull away and get up to about 40-45 when he revs and shoots past me going at least 60. Maybe more.

The light ahead turns red, he attempts to stop, but locks up his tires and goes down, hard. I catch up and pull my bike onto the sidewalk. Get off and go to help him up. He said he was fine after I offered to help him move his bike to the side of the road so he can check it. He said ""no, no, no, I'm fine."" it was obvious his ego was hurt more than his body.

1367988078.0	1dwww3	First day out - got arrested.	megasmash	720	84	283	"Well, it's a little more interesting than that.

I woke up early this morning to transfer ownership and get a plate for my '78 Honda Cb400T. Everything went well, I cam home, plated the bike, and suited up to go to the gym. My inaugural gym ride went well, bike ran perfect. Worked out, suited up, and got on the bike to go home and eat lunch.

About 5mins away from the gym, my chain breaks. It's a nice day, and I'm about an hour's walk away from home. I've got the day off, so I decide to walk the bike home and enjoy the weather, plus, the majority of it is downhill. About 20 mins into the walk, I pass a hospital. Now, I'm walking my disabled motorcycle on a bike/walking trail. I took my gear off because it's hot, and I'm starting to sweat.

I pass a cop car, they don't say anything to me, so I go on my business pushing my Honda.

""STOP STOP STOP!""

I look around to see who is yelling - I thought someone passing by on the street yelled, so I look there. Immediately I'm grabbed and pulled by a female cop. I hold onto the bike so I can put the kickstand down, and not ""drop"" it, and my brand new helmet. Two male officers throw me on the ground, rip my shirt off in the process, put the boots to my back and legs, and cuff me.

I'm fucking stunned beyond belief. I'm exhausted from the gym, exhausted from pushing my bike 5k, and now I have a bunch of cops piling on me, and I'm cuffed, face down on the pavement. In the time this happened, I don't know if my bike made it onto the stand, I don't know if my helmet fell off, I really have no idea what's just happened.

After a few minutes, they pull me up and start to ask where my ID is. Who the bike belongs to. Why am I doing what I was doing...

""My ID is in my jacket pocket, The bike is mine, It's broken - I'm pushing it home.""

I think I repeated that about 15 times before they started to listen.

They run my ID, and cuff me so my hands are now at my front.

An officer explains to me that I ""matched the description"" of someone they were looking for - someone on a ""Black crotch rocket"" that was stolen ran away from cops - I was wearing a bright red shirt, **pushing** a silver 1978 Honda - hardly ""evading arrest"" if you ask me.

They ask me ""Do you understand what just happened?""

No I don't. Why was I taken down and roughed up instead of asked to produce ID? Why was the female officer reaching for her gun, when the only things I had in my hands were motorcycle handlebars?

I'm pretty pissed off at this point, the officers see that, and they're trying to make me ""understand"" the situation. I play along, they uncuff me, and I get to leave.

""Don't I at least get a sorry?""

Ha. Boy was I wrong. ""What should we be sorry for - we're just doing our job."" Is what I got.

So here I am, shirtless, pushing my CB400T down the sidewalk again.

A few minutes later, a black tow truck pulls up to me and offers me a tow.

""No thanks man, I've got no cash.""

""It's ok. I'm a biker too, I saw what they did to you, and I'll hook you up.""

The tow truck driver was really helpful. He strapped my bike down, made sure I was okay, and gave me and the Honda a lift home. I was always of the belief that ""Cops = good, Tow Truck Drivers = scum""... boy has my opinion changed.

When I got home, the Supervising Officer called me to apologize and act all ""buddy-buddy"" to me. It worked for a bit, until I really digested what just happened to me. I assume he is trying to dissuade me from filing a complaint or contacting the media.

What would have happened had I been riding my bike on the road at the time? Would they have acted even more aggressively?

Is that the extent of their description that they act on? ""Man with a motorbike.""

Whatever happened to being asked to produce ID?

I didn't run. I didn't reach for a weapon . I didn't even hear anything other than ""STOP STOP STOP"". I'm walking down a busy sidewalk, who am I to know who they're yelling at? For once I truly feel as if I've been violated. There I was cuffed, face down, half naked on the side of the road.

The more I think about it, the more I'm persuaded to escalate this.

Anyways, I bought a chain, tossed it on the bike, and went out for a ride tonight... where I ran out of gas.

It's bedtime for this guy - I've had a long day.

Here's a pic of me and my Honda the tow truck driver snapped. Less than 24h with this bike and I've already got a hell of a story to tell - it's gonna be a good relationship. [At least I'm smiling.](http://imgur.com/Wyx7atk)

PS: If anyone lives near Rachel's Roadhouse in Mercer PA, I'd love to buy another ""Freedom Isn't Free"" shirt. It was one of my favourites, and Officers Dicklock and Cockknuckels decided to Hulk Hogan it off of me.

**update - 80/05/2013** I've contacted a lawyer and am awaiting a visit to my doctor. Had a hard time sleeping last night, as my shoulder was tense, as well as my right leg. I assume it's from when they held me on the ground with their feet/knees. The more I think about it, the more it irks me. It's not so much the fact that I'm out a t-shirt, and possibly a helmet. It's how I was (mis)treated. I've been ""spot checked"" before for simply walking down the street. They ask me for ID and ask me a few questions. I've got no issue with that - that's a cop doing the job of a cop. Tackling someone and roughing them up simply because they fit the vague description of a wanted person is a cop being a thug.

After the incident you came up beside me to catch my attention and gave me a 'WTF man' gesture.  It didn't register until a few moments later what had happened.  You were in the center lane and I came over on you.  

Normally I am cautious and overly aware of what is going on around me, especially when it comes to cyclists and motorcyclists, but in this case I was distracted by the dumbass in the minivan ahead of me, who in the course of the previous half mile had nearly sideswiped me twice.

In my focus to get away from her, I did the absolute no-no on that particular VA28 S merge, I put on my blinker, checked mirror, checked blind, but changed 2 lanes as she was coming over on me again.  You must have been in that perfect blind spot in the center lane off my driver side rear quarter panel.

1369965122.0	1fdm2z	Real life 'instantaneous karma': 17 yr old brand new rider, his father and myself while at the DMV	jedimindjiujitsu	746	122	234	"Went to the DMV to transfer the title of my newly purchased 2010 R1 Raven. After an hours + wait I finally got called, submitted the paper work to the clerk and an older gentlemen at the booth next to me says, ""How's the R1 treating you?"" Said he saw it parked out front and I'm only the one walking around with a helmet.

We chat for a few moments and he tells me he's there with his 17 yr old helping him getting his motorcycle license. We shoot the shit while our paperwork is being processed and I learn that his son is super green when it comes to riding and he just bought him a 2013 Ninja 300.

I scribble down on a post it note my name and phone number and offer to take his son on a few rides down the local twisty spot (Hwy 9 in Los Gatos, Ca). I got my license at 18 and know better than most the potential for things to end horribly and quickly for a brand new rider.

A few seconds later the clerk prompts me to pay the $36 for registration and I present my credit card. He runs it and asks me to put in my pin and I respond with saying that it's a credit card. He says, ""Oh no.... we don't take those. Only debit. Sorry."" I have no cash, waiting on my new debit card in the mail, so I'm shit outta luck. The clerk hands me my paperwork back and it's 445 so they're closing in 15 mins. Thus me coming back after a quick trip to the bank then bypassing the line that day isn't an option. I just realized that I flushed an hour + at the DMV and Ill have to come back and repeat everything tomorrow.

The father I'd been conversing with steps in and say's ""Let me take care of that for you."" Hands the clerk his debit card, and boom.... I''m good to go. I thank him profusely, recommend this sub reddit to his son and that he pick up the book ""Zen and the Art of the Motorcycle Maintenance."" We chat for a few moments and I'm beyond words that things worked out the way they did.

I was just trying to do the right thing by a 17 yr old kid hungry to get a taste of life on 2 wheels. Within seconds of watching his back.... the karma was bestowed upon me. I'll post again after we go on our first ride together but thought this was a story between riders, the dmv and doing the right thing worth telling to this fine community.

TLDR: Offered to help a 17 yr newb rider at the DMV, seconds later his pop ends up saving the day for me."	t5_2qi6d	True

1350547340.0	11ohzn	I had one of those moments tonight...	StupidDogCoffee	700	97	151	"It's about 7:00 PM and I am taking the scenic route to visit a buddy. I pull into a parking lot to turn around, and take a moment to park the bike and have a break. 

It's a restaurant parking lot and there are plenty of people milling about. Happy families with wide-eyed kids ogling the spaceman on a motorcycle.

I feel rested, it's time to get back on the road. I parked nose-first in a space, so I walk the bike out into a nice starting position. I know that I should put the sidestand down and do a proper mount, but I'm smooth mr spaceman Steve on his shiny motorcycle, so I just throw a leg over.

It should be noted, at this point, that I am riding a fairly tall dual sport bike.

I immediately discover that just throwing a leg over was a mistake. The bike leans a little too much for comfort, and 320 pounds of motorcycle are leaning against the only leg I have planted on the ground. I put my other foot down quickly, to give myself more stability, but this pushes the bike further down. I feel the mass of the bike as it crosses that threshold between mostly staying vertical and mostly staying horizontal. 

I shifted my leg and braced myself as I gripped the handlebars. I was not dropping this fucking bike while those kids were watching me with their goddamned eyes. Every ounce of strength went into pulling against the mass of that bike, and by sheer brute force I kept it from touching the ground. 

With a great heave, I pulled the bike upright, and sat upon my seat of glory. I had battled the most fundamental forces of the universe and come out victorious. The motorcycle gods had tested me, and I was vidicated. The spectators did not see a man drop a motorcycle at a complete stop today, nosiree. They saw a man wrestle a rebellious machine into obedience. They saw a man in complete control of the world around him.

I killed the engine pulling out of the parking lot."	t5_2qi6d	True

I'm not going to bore you with the details of my life, but put simply I've suffered from depression and severe social anxiety from the age of 16 - 10 years ago - and I've never really been ""cured"".

I'm sure a lot of you reading this have suffered from, or know someone suffering with, depression but severe social anxiety is quite rare. Simple tasks such as going outside and checking the mailbox bring me out in cold sweats, buying groceries is done at the quietest times, people stopping me to ask for directions wonder why I mumble out a ""I'm sorry"" before I hurriedly run off. Quite frankly, my life is torture. People say things such as ""go to the Doctor and get some medication"", but it's not as simple as that for me when I can't even man up and go to the doctors. The only reason I got diagnosed at age 16 was because my parents dragged me (quite literally) to see the school counselor over concerns with my poor grades.

Having social anxiety ruins any chance I have with making friends, and I spend all my spare time alone in my apartment watching TV or surfing the internet. The only text messages I receive are to tell me a bill is due. I can freely admit I don't have any friends; not because I don't want them, but because I'm too scared to talk to people.

When I was 18 I was involved in a car crash (I was at fault) and now suffer from a constant dull back pain that I have to take medication for and lately my mother's health has been deteriorating and I really worry she might not be around for much longer.

For a number of years now I've always wanted to go and get my bike license but have always put it off for one reason or another (nearly all related to my anxiety). But a few months ago I booked myself in for the Pre-learners course (a bit like your MSF courses) here in Sydney. I nearly didn't get out of bed. But I did. I nearly didn't get out of the car. But I did. I walked into the classroom and sat down quietly jumping for joy that I had got all that way without backing out.

Unfortunately I had turned up on the wrong day and was in fact scheduled for the following month. That's embarrassing for anyone but for someone like me I spiraled into depression; How could I have been so stupid to not read the date on the email correctly?

The next time was a quadrillion times harder. What if the trainer remembers me and brings it up to the new class? I didn't think I could cope. But I did. The other people in the group all had some experience with bikes from riding dirt bikes on a farm to needing to re-sit the Pre-Learners because their L's had expired. I had no experience and was by far the most greenhorn out of the lot. My anxiety rose again and I suddenly thought of an escape route. Perhaps I could pretend to get a phone call and say I have to shoot off? But I didn't.

I got on the bike for the first time and suddenly everything wrong with my life went away, I was like an innocent child just playing with a new toy. I picked up riding quickly. Everything the trainer was teaching us I was doing first go without too much trouble. The occasional stall or finding Neutral didn't faze me as much as I thought it would've before I did the course.

After passing the course I went on the hunt for my own bike and eventually found a bike that I wanted. I had to bring my Father along with me to the dealership as I couldn't face the salesman on my own. I became the proud owner of a CBR250.

Since then I have ridden nearly every day; nothing major, just a 15 minute trip to work or 10 minute ride to my parents place but I have never felt the thrill of living life more than when I sit on my bike. Some people may scoff at that statement, but for someone who struggles facing each day that little bit of pleasure gives me the ability to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that someday I may beat my battle with depression and anxiety.

For those few minutes each day everything I stress and worry about is gone. I no longer worry about falling into suicidal thoughts, I no longer worry about what people think of me, I don't worry about my financial troubles or my back pain as it's just me and the bike.

I needed to get this off my chest as my depression took a bit of a downward spiral today and I just wanted to share with the world that getting my bike license may have possibly saved my life. Thank you for reading."	t5_2qi6d	True

As the bottle was flying toward me, I somehow caught it in midair (I still don't know how I did it), so I rode up alongside in the next lane until I was next to the passenger in the truck and threw the water bottle back at him, thus scaring the living crap out of him.  Best experience I ever had in repaying karma and from the back of a motorcycle, no less!	t5_2qi6d	True

Happened around 4-5am most likely three or 4 guys, burned the glue off of my garage windows pulled it out and pulled the manual garage string opener. I had 2 bikes in the Garage but they only managed to get away with one or only choose to take one regardless they had to have carried it out because i had my steering lock on, and there was a car parked close enough to the door that you wouldn't be able to role it out. 2010 gsxr, white and blue, blue woodcraft frame sliders, carbon fiber tank pad and gas tank pad, DDM HID pure white with hint of blue, glow in the dark UV rim tape, yellowish white in the day, aqua blue at night. Like the bike from TRON. If spotted let me know. Thanks.

Damogran6	587	113	246	"There's no shortage of 'damn those textin', blind, ignorant cagers, but in my obervations over the last 18 months, I've seen plenty of bikes with zero following distance, hanging out in the blind spot of other cars, and just generally leaving no space (space=time) to sort out bad shit when it goes down. 

I expect plenty of downvotes, and this is aimed at noone in particular and everyone in general (myself included, which is why I even HAD the thought process)
Your bike can do things 4 times faster than the cars around you...but your reflexes aren't always 4 times greater, no matter how superhuman you feel. Compound that with: exercising those superhuman skills can put you in a position where you don't have 100% control of your environment....That gap in the middle lane that you can apparate to? That space is wanted by a car in the slow lane, and neither you nor them know each other exists.

That car ahead of you doing 80 mph? Sure you can follow 8 feet back and still stop in time....but what about the car behind YOU that's ALSO going 80 mph? Your following distance ahead of you should account for your stopping space *and the distance required for the guy behind you to get their head out of their ass and get slowed down too*.

I find while commuting, I spend the bulk of my time in the fast lane (cuts 1/3 of the potential attack vectors), hugging the outside of the lane (gives space to act if someone crowds the lane and I need to react), and I don't do a whole lot of lane changes (commuters are a predictable bunch, I should be predictable, too.)

I hear lots of 'I nearly got squished by a fuckin' cager with their nose in ther cellphone and their head up their ass' and I think ""If you know they're like that, wouldn't you want to be as far away from them as possible?""

Yeah, I know, you're in heavy traffic, there's no space! Well, make some then. Slow down a bit. If someone darts into the space you make...make some more. Save the heroics for the weekends in much more deserted parts of the landscape. 

I await your downvotes now...but would appreciate some constructive conversation instead. "	t5_2qi6d	True

So I was at a stop light on a 55 MPH limit highway, and the light turned green, I was having a bit of fun so I gunned it until I was going about 60 and leveled off.  Just a bit later, the SUV that was next to me at the light shot past me going at least 80.  When I got to the next light it was red, and the SUV is stopped in the other lane.  

I come to a stop next to it and the woman driving puts her window down and this happens...

Her: YOU CAN'T DRIVE SO FAST!!!

Me: ...what?

Her: You were speeding so much!  Slow down or I'm calling the cops!

Me: But... I... You were going faster than me.

Her: NO! You just took off after the light changed!

Me: I mean... I accelerated faster, but that's not a crime.  You passed me.  If-

Her: YOU WERE JUST GOING TOO FAST!

Me: If you passed me you have to have been going faster.  I don't have time to explain to you how physics works.

She shouted something about me not listening to her and I just closed my visor and the light changed, so I promptly got off of that road.

Like I said, at first I was pissed off because in general, one of the few things that makes me mad is when other people get mad for no reason, but after I chilled out I realized how stupid the entire encounter was, haha."	t5_2qi6d	True

* I sing 

* I bob my head when I'm singing
* I wave at strangers just to confuse them 
* I scratch my helmet in traffic to confuse people 
* I narrate my journey
* When it's raining heavily I'll often amuse people in town by pretending to shower (Scrubbing under my pits and washing my hair)
* If the roads clear I will often pretend to pedal my motorcycle when passing cyclists
* I push my indicator cancel button and pretend to fire missiles at people 
* I swing my legs about when the roads are slow and open 
* I'll rev my engine at red lights when I'm next to someone who's easily challenged then launch sedately and watch them bolt off braking suddenly because they’re embarrassed 
* Very rarely if I have time to kill I’ll ask for directions then as someone talking I’ll shoot off… 

(That last one is sort of a dickish move but I rarely do it)

I'll generally have fun on my bike. 

Sometimes it's a bit strange and I'll admit I have been known for not being particularly normal amongst friends and family but I'm always safe on the roads and playing around puts a smile on my face.

**So what do you guys do for fun when you're riding?**

But about half-way as I'm pushing my bike as fast as I can, a local cop pulls up next to me and says ""I thought you are supposed to ride *on* the bike, not beside it."" I answered back that my reserve is not working.

He then proceeded to screen the traffic so I can get across to the turn lane, and followed me till I made it into the station. I was half suspecting he'd pull in and check my papers, but he didn't. He just went on.

A night cap, if you will, and I went to take the dog on his before-bed-walk when I saw a dark shiny puddle next to my bike. It obviously wasn't oil, but I've had a few fights with my float needle where it decided that it wanted to make it so that all the gas from my tank released itself via the float bowl overflow.

I was afraid it was just such an occasion, so, because I love my bike so damn much, I placed two fingers in the puddle and brought it up to my nose for an investigatory sniff. 

Back to the few drinks. My fine motor skills are not quite what they should have been, and my fingers, instead of gently wafting the scent of whatever the fluid was, went directly into my mustache. 

It was dog piss. Straight up dog piss. And it was in my mustache. I was simultaneously relieved and infuriated.

Laugh at me, or share a similar story. I just thought y'all should know. I'll be washing my face repeatedly.

1365181996.0	1bqstg	After seeing that hour long video of wrecks I have a few pointers for riders old and new alike.	Kwiatkowski	463	78	156	"Hey guys, I have a few pointers to avoiding accidents that may help some of you.  Now you may have heard these before but take them to heart and they'll save your ass.

1.  If you are riding around traffic cover your controls and be extra cautious!  The more cars around you the higher the chance that one will try to hit you.  

2.  Practice emergency handling in a safe environment.  I have seen many many videos of people going down because of locked wheels or going off a turn while braking, here are some simple ways to practice.  For straight line braking the goal should be no locking of either wheel at all.  In a parking lot ride towards a friend at increasing speed, when his hand goes up stop as fast as possible, have the friend vary timing greatly to keep you on your toes.  For breaking mid turn draw a large circle in the lot with chalk and a string or with whatever you can, the point here is a decent size circle that you can clearly follow.  Follow the circle starting at low speed and break to a stop while staying as close to the line as possible.  Each time you are able to complete the course without too much trouble increase your speed by a few MPH.  This will get hard very fast once you build some lean, but you will learn at what lean angle you can comfortably stop without losing your lane.  Once you learn that angle make that the farthest that you will go when you may have to stop (traffic, blind corners, night, rain, etc). 

3. Don't race on the road!  It isn't worth it.  EVER.  It costs much less than a ticker, higher premiums, bike repairs, or hospital bills to just do a track day form time to time.  

4.  If you are going to practice tricks by all means do so, but in a private lot and not on the street.  The highway is no place to show off.

5.  Going to push it in the twisties?  Is there a chance that you'll lowside?  Get frame sliders front and back if needed.  you will probably go down at some point and these may save your bike from most damage and maybe all of it.  

6.  Slick and sticky sport bike tires are great for dry grip, but be extremely cautious in the cold or rain!  Grip will be halved or more in bad weather with pure sport tires.  If you ride in a place where you encounter these often you may want to consider different tires for your super sport, consider good sport touring tires.

7.  ATGATT,  if you don't want to go all gear that's your right, but please wear a full face helmet. 

8.  Don't ride near or past your limit.  There will be a time on a road that's beyond fun that you push it too far.  Your bike may be able to handle it but that doesn't mean you can (see asgeorge for clarity).  

9.  Keep your bike well maintained and in good riding health.  Make a quick checklist and go over it before a ride.  Things to check:  Oil, tires, chain, suspension, battery.  All of these can be checked in under a minute with a quick walk around.  

10.  Ride often!  The more miles the more you will learn. and the better you will get.  

11.  A bike may be the stuff of your dreams, but if it's not comfortable you won't enjoy it.  That cafe racer may be beautiful but commuting on it might be hell for your back.  

12. Any blind corner can instantly become a death trap!  Be extremely cautious around them. (Thanks Konwayz!)

13. Road debris travels in groups. If you see one piece cover your controls and be prepared because chances are there are more coming up ahead. (thanks Jaque8!)

One morning I walked out to my bike to find a big ass 'fuhgettaboutit' chain around a nearby pole and a note clipped to my gas tank lid. It reads:

""Hey, my name is Jon and I had my 2009 Yamaha R6 stolen from this complex not too long ago. I don't mean to be negative but I would like to offer you a chain while you park here. My number is XXXXXXXXXX. You can have both keys to this lock while you park here. I left the chain near your horse. Just hit me up if you want to borrow my chain for the rest of the season. Cheers brother. - JON the Reckoner""

It made my day.
