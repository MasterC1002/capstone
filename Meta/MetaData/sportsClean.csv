1348545438.0	10fkup	I've watched NFL football for as long as I can remember, but its boycott time.	bro_digz	1988	756	595	"NFL: Give me real refs, or fuck off.

Reddit: Join me and get real refs back and games that matter.

This is ridiculous. I don't care who wins/loses, and never have... but I expect to see a real game. Players expect the refs to know and understand the rules, and the replacement refs clearly don't. NFL, this is your fault. The real refs deserve what they get. They clearly make the game work and call the game better than others can. For fucks sweet fucking sake: pay them. I, for one, won't be watching any NFL games until I see Ed Hocule come back. No refs? No football.

UPDATE: This thread began with me getting mad after the Monday night game wasted my time. I blasted this thread off into the ether, then came back to find all of this. Thanks for your comments. Now I get to try and respond to 350 of you. I'll do my best!  Also, I put some further thoughts in a comment, probably buried in the thread somewhere.

Thanks again, Reddit.

MORE UPDATING: After reading as many as I can, and posting some replies, I see a trend in comments and will try addressing them all here.

1&gt; I asked you all to join me in abandoning the NFL.  I think it would be a cool statement, but I don't really care what all of you do. I appreciate the words of advice from those of you who suggested campaigns of letters and complaint brigades and the like. I'll be perfectly happy for this to be a boycott of one. I encourage the rest of you to do something, and I'd be happy to help but....

2&gt; .... there are more important ways I can spend my time. I agree. I have a number of hobbies, and watching a game I love is only one of them.  Furthermore, if I were to put this much effort into a protest, it wouldn't be for the NFL.  Do what you want, NFL. I won't be watching.

3&gt; To all of you who suggest the best course of action is to 'do nothing', you're lazy pussies.  The refs need your support.

Last night was the final straw. I've been watching the replacements fuck up games in the name of the NFL for 3 weeks now, and I decided to myself that I simply don't need it. It hurt a little. I love to watch these games. I don't care who's playing, or where. I don't generally care who's winning. I don't have a team that I go batshit for. I just watch the games, as many as I can.  I won't be watching until the refs are back to make the game work right.

It's likely that the players care even less than the 17 viewers nationwide who watch this thing.  It's just a mess of a game anyhow.  It takes teams MONTHS to congeal before the season even starts.  They simply think that because the best players are getting together that they'll just make super teams within one week?  Psh.

Players should still be nominated as All-Star rosters for their outstanding play.  However, neither them nor the viewers give a crap about this game.

Just end the misery.

EDIT:  Furthermore, what makes the playoffs, and even some of the regular season so exciting, is the precision of the game.  Parodies such as fumbles and three-bounce interceptions are fun, but not the whole reason we watch the game.  We watch because we want to see hard hits and excellent play making.  That takes a lot of practice and understanding amongst teammates that doesn't come in just one week.

Vegas.	clabia	1262	390	330	"With a full season NBA lock-out looming, what better time is there to try something completely out of the box?  No owners, no teams, no allegiances--just bragging rights (and a large sum of money for the winner, of course).

The tournament would be structured just like March Madness.  Players are ranked 1-64 ([maybe like this?](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7064442/#nbarank-players-rankings-chart)) and matched up against each other  in four different brackets.

**Format:**  Games would be played to eleven (1's and 2's).  A round would be the best of five games (first player to win three games to 11 advances to the next round).

**No Refs:**  The only two people on the court are the players.  I'm tired of ticky-tacky fouls and players pleading to the refs like babies.  None of that in our house.  **Players call their own fouls**.  If a player is getting away with a lot, let's leave it up to the crowd to shame him with boos.  Also crowds will likely reward both players for not calling many fouls--which is what everyone wants.

**Other:**  
*Half court*--this way fans can get closer to the action.  If there is a change of possession a player must dribble outside the three point line.  

*Change of possession after a score*-- I'm thinking this will balance out match-ups with major size differences.  If Chris Paul is going up against Dwight Howard and they're playing winners, Dwight might be able to just back him down every time.  But if they're changing possession at least CP3 gets a fair shot at rebuttal.  

*No free-throws*-- This is something that could be debated but I'd vote no.

*Win by two*--Possibly a no-brainer but I'd also be open to winning by 3 or 4.



P.S.  **Michael Jordan must play.**



EDIT:  Formatting and spelling.  Also shirts vs skins might increase the female viewership.

EDIT 2:  As many people have suggested, 3-on-3 or 2-on-2 would indeed be more fun.  Also I think that discussion can easily transition into talks about less NBA teams (higher concentration of star faces on the court).

It is now impossible to watch a full episode of Sportscenter without them quoting an athlete's retarded, pointless tweet. Today for example, they talked at length about Ochocinco's tweet, and Teddy Bruschi's response. Who cares? Then it got even worse. They quoted tweets of LeBron James and Dwayne Wade joking back and forth at each other about absolutely nothing. **WHO GIVES A SHIT!!!** If I really wanted to know what athletes are tweeting, guess where I would go? Fucking Twitter!

It's not like today is a particularly slow day in sports either. We're in the thick of the playoff race in baseball, and one week into a brand new football season. There is *plenty* to talk about. So please, Sportscenter, more highlights, analysis, and predictions, and less stupid Twitter bullshit.

1286496004.0	dobbo	I proposed a rule change to the NFL.  What do you think?	Stunod7	771	198	265	"During the 3rd Quarter of the 9/27/2010 Green Bay @ Chicago game the Packers were backed up to their 1 yard line.  False start, half the distance to the goal to the half yard.  False start again, half the distance to the goal to the quarter yard.  Next Play Green Bay gains 7, play after that they gain 10.  

In this scenario, is half the distance to the goal going to mean anything?  So I called the NFL, spoke with a director in the officiating department and proposed that instead of these meaningless half the distance to the goal penalties, why not simply back up the first down marker?  So it's no longer 1st and 10 1/4 yards with first down at the 10.  It's now 1st and 15 with first down at the 15.  They jump again, 1st and 20 with first down at the 20.  

They said they'd kick the idea around at their next officiating meeting.  But am I the only one?  Wouldn't it make sense, in the case of the ball being on the 1 or under, to back up the first down markers?  If the defense jumps offside I'm sure the offense would appreciate the penalty yardage but if the offense does it they are only ""penalized"" a fraction of a yard.

Life is pain.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.

He doesn't even exercise.

There will be no survivors.

The only reason they say they won't survive is because no one ever has.

Fans think their playoff chances are dead, but in truth they're only mostly dead.

About coaches:  You guys have heard of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates?  Morons compared to these guys.

These coaches are men of action.  Lies do not become them.

In closing the show, Wingo said,  ""You both seem decent fellows I'd hate to kill you.""

Schlereth replied,  ""We'd hate to die.""

Afterwards they gave each other five.  You could tell it was amazingly intentional.  Clever fellas.

She (my partner) is a Nurse Practitioner in Women's Health, so she's all about breast cancer awareness, but she made a good point; Football and the NFL would do far better educating and bringing awareness to a far larger issue, that is heart disease.  It is the [number one killer in America](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm), and it affects both sexes, more importantly the often obese viewers of the NFL (yes, I'm stereotyping but the point still remains true).

This mainly was an exercise to create a better organized, easier to use and visually appealing version what ESPN.com currently offers on their homepage. An in depth discovery would be needed with the client moving forward if I were to tackle a true redesign.

My inspiration really came from ESPN the Magazine. I really believe the merging of magazine layout and website content will continue to blur the lines. I especially believe if I were to tackle this as a real project, it would have to be designed, and built to scale and spider to any platform, in any form. This would allow a specialized iPad version of their site that would mimic a powerful interactive magazine.

Anyway, hope you enjoy what you see, it really was just for fun. If you are reading this ESPN, hi.

At the top-right of every text article, there is a ""Print"" button. This button doesn't actually prompt your computer to print, but rather takes you to a printer-friendly page.

I say we start linking to these versions of the articles we post. I think it would make the world a happier place.

EDIT: I should note that it's not *just* the mere existence of videos that upset me (although the ads, etc. truly are mind-numbing). It's also the fact that only ~10% of the embedded videos actually have anything to do with the article you are reading.

1302627088.0	gobx8	Sam Fuld hit for the cycle... but didn't.	29a	401	98	141	"It's amongst the most useless feats in baseball, but one of the most coveted nonetheless. The cycle.

 

On Monday night, Tampa Bay Rays left fielder Sam Fuld stepped to the plate in the top of the ninth just a single shy of the cycle. With his team leading 14-4 and two runners on, the 29-year-old ripped a shot to the left-field corner. If you were in his shoes, what would you have done?

 

According to Joe Maddon: “Some guys in the dugout said they would have slid into first base.""

 

Fuld didn’t. He rounded first and made it into second base safely finishing the day 4-6 with 11 total bases instead of 10. By not stopping at first, Fuld will not get his name on Major League Baseball’s “Rare and Memorable Feats” page for his performance. By taking that extra bag, the fourth-year pro will not see his name on MLB and ESPN’s front pages.

 

What does that say about an “accomplishment” that is arguably worth less than a pair of home runs in a game? The game was well in hand and the Rays won it comfortably, but rather than be content with the minimum, Sam Fuld did everything he could to help his team win, even when it didn’t really matter.

 

Soak it in baseball fans, because you just witnessed a truly rare feat. How often is it that you see someone put more effort into their work, only to receive less attention and fewer accolades? Well, besides wherever it is you work."	t5_2qgzy	True
