1335541311.0	svesa	Some great Disney service that blew my mind -- had to share somewhere.		174	12	30	"Had to give credit to Disney CMs somewhere.  I had gone on a trip with my wife and son in November of last year and while there my wife bought me a nice Mickey pen for our anniversary.  It was a nice heavy thing etched with rough sketches of the Mouse and notes giving hints on how to draw him.  I used it everyday at work until one day about a month ago when it was stolen off my desk while I was at lunch.

Now I know it wasn't a very expensive pen, but being a gift it meant a lot and I was devastated knowing that the chances of it being found were slim, and even getting a replacement would be a long shot with how merchandise turns over in the parks.  I gave it a shot anyway.

Nothing at work turned up, so a call into Disney for help finding a replacement was in order.  I called up, fully expecting to purchase a replacement, but I only had the vague description above to go on.  I spent about a half an hour on the phone telling my story to a couple different Cast Members who tried to help me, all the while sharing general Disney and family stories too, but were unable to find anything.  They asked for my name, number, and address(?) and said they would contact me if anything turned up, they needed to try another location but the computers were down.  I gave them the info and then forgot about until yesterday when I see a box from Lake Buena Vista on my porch.  I opened it up and found [this](http://imgur.com/a/ZJg09) inside a Disney Parks bag.  There was no invoice, no bill, no anything inside except the bag, box, and packaging.

I called the customer service line I had used a month ago and asked what happened and how I could pay for this (I had a reference number form earlier). The Cast Member, James, said the only note on the file was ""Happy Anniversary"".  I insisted on paying, and he said it was ""taken care of, Happy Anniversary"".  Wouldn't even tell me who had bought it or who to thank.  So thanks Disney!!

tl;dr -- Anniversary gift from the Parks was stolen, called Disney and they took pity on me and replaced it for free."	t5_2qh8g	True

1370779753.0	1fz7s2	I'd like to hear everyone's favorite experience with Disney magic. Here is mine...	MyDisneyIdentity	147	21	38	"When I worked in Guest Relations in the Magic Kingdom I was approached by two nurses from Florida Hospital. They had two very sad little girls with them. To make long story short(ish), the girls and their parents were tourists from the UK. They were driving back to their hotel on 192 after spending the day at Epcot when they were in a horrible traffic accident. Their mother was decapitated and the father died in the hospital that night (the children, Susan and Heather, did not know their father had died. The hospital sent the nurses to the Magic Kingdom to get a refund on their park tickets and give them a day in the park before breaking the news to them). After refunding the full price of their tickets, I was given permission to be their VIP tour guide for the rest of my shift. As I was walking them down Main Street, I pulled out every tour guide trick I could think of to make them smile. Nothing worked. Not only were the girls physically sick (one had a broken arm, the other one was in a rented wheelchair) they were seriously depressed. I was beginning to believe that this tour was a lost cause when something miraculous happened. We were going over the liberty Square bridge when I pointed out the VIP viewing section. I said to the girls ""Remember when we were in City Hall and I was talking on the telephone? I was telling Mickey Mouse that you were here and he was very excited. He asked me if after we watched the parade we could follow it back to City Hall because he'd really like to meet you!"" All of a sudden, these grief stricken, depressed, totally broken little girls smiled. ""We get to meet Mickey Mouse?"" I hadn't set any of this up of course, but I ran with it. ""Oh yes"" I said, ""he's super excited to see you!"" Then the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in the 24 years I've worked at Disney happened. I watched these two tragic victims slowly turn back into little girls. I put the girls and the two nurses on It's a Small World and slipped backstage to make a phone call, and cried my eyes out. I told the Entertainment MOD the story and she set up the meet and greet. When I met Susan and Heather at unload they were not the same little girls that I put on that boat. They were happy. They had changed.

We watched the parade from the bridge and when the finale unit passed by, Mickey twisted around (which is hard to do because he's attached to a safety harness) pointed at us then pointed to Main Street. We followed the parade back to City Hall and went into the VIP lounge (back when they had one). I went backstage to get Mickey (who was very good friends with KT Brister, I want to recognize her) and explain the situation. Mickey simply said ""let's go"" and walked directly to MO3 without so much as a breath of fresh air. Well, I hope you can imagine what happened next because I really can't put it into words. Not only did Mickey Mouse spend about 45 minutes with us, every single parade performer came to meet us. It was the most magical experience I've ever witnessed (in fact, it was the turning point of my career because I suddenly realized I was in the wrong department). The rest of the day was amazing. We ate Dole Whips and turkey legs, rode the teacups until we were silly dizzy and had the best day of MY life. 

I never saw those girls again. I don't know how they got back to the UK or what happened that night when they learned of their father's fate, and for that I am truly grateful. All I want to remember from that day is the look on their faces, and the warm smiles from those nurses, when they learned they were going to get to meet one very special mouse.
