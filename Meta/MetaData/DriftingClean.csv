Nobody really knows what he does or why he is there, but he is awesome and always right up in the action. It has recently come to my attention via a friend who chatted with him on facebook that he may not be attending Road Atlanta in May. This makes me kind of sad because he is basically a spokesperson for the sport. He says that he can't afford to go as of right now.  What I am wondering is is there anything that can be done about this? He sells shirts and stickers on his page. If we could get the community aware of this it would be cool if we could get him to the rest of the events. Idk, it just kind of upset me today to hear that.  Just kind of venting because I'm sure some of you here know who he is.  Two weekends ago at Long Beach he was standing at the wall in turn 2 and drivers like Chelsea Denofa were high fiving him as they drove by and now he might not be there anymore. Anyway he's a really cool dude and I want to see him there. If anybody has any ideas feel free to post.	t5_2ryb6	True

Basically here my idea, I have a indiegogo account set up, I won't link my project here just unless people like it.

first of, at least 20% of what I make will go the charity guide dogs for the blind, whom I volunteer for.

So here it goes.
you pledge money, You get a message on my car, ranging from a small hand written message to a window banner. 

I have all the details of the project on my indiegogo page.

I feel like this could turn out awesome, kind of a piece of social art, only sideways! 


Lastly let me say, this is not a plea for money, I can fund this car myself, It will take a little longer but I don't care at all, I also can get  local sponserships. I have talked to a few business owners. But that is boring. This sounds interesting and fun!

Anyway what do you all think? cool idea? horrible idea?

1374428382.0	1irc9y	Not my lucky day	Dancoolface	25	2	22	"So, I went to go to an event in New Hampshire today called Live Free and Slide. It was a pretty big hassle to try to go given the 3 hour drive one way to the event and the face that I'm 16 and had to go run it through my parents (conservatives). So I persevere and get the okay, and get up around 4am to get on the road. get there around 7 (traffic), still half asleep, and go to get a spectator ticket. I was told i had to be 18 to enter. I said i wasnt going to be driving in the event, just watching. ""Still have to be 18,"" the woman said. Nothing on the website for the event said anything about an age limit. She said i could enter if i had an adult with me, which i did not. I had to take the sad and disappointing 3 hour drive home at 7 in the morning. The worst part about the whole ordeal was the fact that I could hear the engines and tires screeching and smell the tires burning and exhaust. Its what i love. It was so close but so far away. 
So my question is, in the world of Motorsports, is the fact that I'm not legally an adult make me an automatic liability and therefore not allowed entrance to events unless I have a person who is legally an adult with me? It isn't like I was going to be anywhere near the cars, I was going to be sitting in the stands, just watching what i love and people enjoying themselves in the great sport we all love here at r/Drifting. Nothing can be done about the past, what's done is done, just some enlightening wisdom is all I'm asking for here. Thanks guys, keep slidin!"	t5_2ryb6	True

I've chimed in, and even tried to persuade people to use Battle Version parts, because i believe Alex makes quality parts compared to other manufactures. I've been on hand to see, order, compile, assemble, ship, bill and even create new parts with Battle Version. 


The time came for Battle Version to hire a new fabricator, and in the beginning, my hours cut were good because i wanted growth for the company. Today i learned that i wouldn't be able to work there because of finances. It's a small shop, and either they continue to make quality parts @ a higher cost to you (because of overhead), or they raise prices, possibly ensuring their demise. As it is we have to compete with companies that create parts for profit only, sacraficing quality. I can ensure you that every part was hand assembled and hand tested. Every part was handled and inspected at least 5 times by us, before it was shipped. That means that a simple control arm may have been inspected as many as 25 times before it headed out the door. 

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have met so many influential people in the Aftermarket and Drifting society. I'm glad Alex took the time to explain suspension, geometry and it's importance. I will continue to endorse their parts as i firmly believe in Battle Version today as when i started working there and when i heard about them in 2002. 

TL:DR
I lost my job, but it's for the greater good. "	t5_2ryb6	True
