There was no cops, gas stations, grocery stores or any forms of entertainment. I knew every person by name. No one locked their doors, vehicles, or sheds.

* The country really is that beautiful.

* Yes there are a lot of sheep.

* Yes, we have socialised healthcare and yes, it works really well (and by really well, I mean that you get some healthcare which, as far as I can tell, is already leaps and bounds ahead of the USA).

* Despite a semi-vocal minority of close-minded idiots, we are an extremely liberal country. We have legal prostitution and also civil unions. We were the first country to give women the vote (1893) and the first country to have a transgender Member of Parliament.

1327612102.0	oy41g	I live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Home of the largest harbour in Europe.	donkeybrainsify	25	3	24	"I live in Rotterdam. Rotterdam is the second largest city in the Netherlands (Amsterdam being the largest) with a population of about 600.000 people. The metropolitan area counts over a million people though. Rotterdam is known for a few things: Until 2004 it was home to the world's largest harbor. Nowadays this title has been taken over by Shanghai, but it is needless to say that it is still very huge. This makes Rotterdam a working class city a opposed to the upper-middle class city which is Amsterdam.

Rotterdam is also known for it's history in WWII. The city was bombed to bits leaving nearly all of the city centre ravaged. After the war came the 'Wederopbouw' (rebuilding) of Rotterdam, which since then has been called 'City without a heart'. Actually, Rotterdam has been in a permanent state of rebuilding. This makes it an interesting city for architecture buffs. 

A few other interesting things about Rotterdam:

- Together with Frankfurt it is the only European city that can be considered a highrise city. Although the highest building is only 165m, there are a suprisingly large amount of highrise buildings (taller than 70m) in the centre of the city.

- Rotterdam has a reputation of hosting great festivals. Currently the International Film Festival Rotterdam is being held. It has a reputation quite like the Sundance filmfestival, meaning it is easily accessible to the common man. Another famous festival is the North Sea Jazz Festival which is held every summer with amazing line-ups every year. 2010 Rotterdam hosted the prologue of the Tour de France.

- Rotterdam is a city in which the majority of people is of foreign descent. This makes it very much a multi cultural city, which has it's pro's and con's ofcourse. It has a big population of Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Chinese, Cape Verdian and many other immigrants.

Well, there is much more to tell about Rotterdam. If you want to know more, feel free to ask anything!"	t5_2r4v8	True

The Islands are a very friendly community and whist, yes there is drinking and dancing in the pubs (just like the UK) there are also a lot of private events. I am always spending time with friends, birthdays, BBQs, girly gossip evenings- just the same as uk, there is a cinema at the military base too. 
The majority of residents work in tourism &amp; fishing. But we have all the other jobs just like the UK, post office, government, shops, conservation, farming etc and of course now oil. 
Most people here know that Argentina cant afford another war yet, so the risk is slim but its more the problems they are causing with shipping that worries us, or rather, irritates us! 
I wasn't born untill 9 years after the war but my parents where both here, my dad was in the local defence force and everyone was just glad to see the brits!
Without a doubt the Falklands are Brits! We will never belong to Argentina, I speak for every Islander I have ever had this conversation with when I say this. I hope this helps fill in the gaps, any more questions feel free to ask!

edit: Most of you probably know this, but people often confuse names, so here:

* The Netherlands = The country (around 16m inhabitants)
* Amsterdam = Its capital (around 1m)
* Holland = Officially just a region of The Netherlands (that includes Amsterdam), but in practice always used as a synonym for The Netherlands as a whole
* Dutch = The name of our language, and anything from The Netherlands is called Dutch (so e.g. Amsterdam is a Dutch city, I think its called the adjective) "	t5_2r4v8	True
1259373643.0	a8ug7	ILiveIn Project! Let's get people representing every continent and ask them cultural questions, world news opinions and compare them. We could learn a lot from the contrast!	IceX	22	2	26	"ILiveIn was born as an IAmA spinoff. Unfortunately so far, it has had only a fair amount of success. The main problem I see is that, unless the location is related to some important landmark, is particularly bizarre or has appeared on a recent news piece. 

Most of the time when someone says ""I live in SomeWhere, SomeCountry"", the only replies I see are ""hey, I live there too! nice!"" and honestly sometimes is hard to find a relevant question regarding the location (whileas IAmA lacks that issue by being always able to ask ""what kind of cheese do you like the most"").

By getting a few people altogether, now lots of simple questions such as ""at what time do you have dinner?"", ""What's the silliest custom you have"" or ""what's the definition of a hot female where you live?"", can generate better answers, debate and laughs in general.

So, what do you say? If we could get 5 or 6 people willing to answer a few questions on a weekend, we could have a nice ILiveIn. The other possibility would be to create a new post for gathering generic questions such as the ones previously mentioned, and once we have a few, we pick the best and the people willing to answer can start a new self post with the answers to those questions and allow people to follow up on them.

**EDIT**

Up to now we have:

danilosaur/cartola: Brazil

TheLeaderIsGood: England/Ireland

fangus: Scotland

olihahe: Iceland

thecapitalc: Canada

odddrums: Norcal/Hollywood

fleg: Poland

IceX: Argentina

random_pattern: Bushwick, NYC

BritishEnglishPolice: UK, Near London

And many more that will pop up.
That is more than great! We even have an UK trifecta
I'd love to see someone from Africa, someone from Eastern Asia, someone from the former USSR block, and of course someone from Oceania, so we would have a lot of diversity. Later today I'll think of an initial block of questions, and invite everyone to participate!

I hope you like the idea, if we get a few people and enough enthusiasm I believe it could be fun!


**EDIT 2** 

Ok, it seems we have enough people for this project to happen, we should now move to Step 2: The questions. cartola seems to have a few very interesting ones (I really love the idea of making the questions multimedia-friendly, with youtube videos, songs, links and all!). I'll now create a new ILiveIn post with the questions cartola and I have been thinking about. Feel free to add your own or tweak/criticize (in a respectful manner) the existing questions. Once we have a solid set of the best questions there, we can move to step 3 of a comparative answering of the questions and enlightenment will ensue!


Oh, one last thing, even though I came up with this post, I don't want you to think this is my idea and I'm running the show and calling the shots. Please Feel free to criticize, suggest ways to improve all this, or even say ""Hey, I'd do a better job than you organizing this stuff!""

He accepted that offer and four months later we were here in Kingston.

* This city is an international commerce point, and *also* is very near the border, so it gets plenty of influence from the US. People want to be closer to the American dream and further away from the Mexican stereotype (i.e. there seems to be this attitude that ""indian natives"" are generally the inferior ""caste,"" and not only due to economic disadvantage.)

* Considering the above, speaking English is the norm, not the exception.

* Eating disorders abound.

* Predominantly Catholic area. (OP is an atheist, raised Catholic)

* This is the #1 city regarding car accidents, mostly due to drunk drivers and really bad license regulation (lots of 15-year olds driving BMW's, it's fairly easy to get a license even if you are not that great of a driver, etc.)

As promised, here are the questions cartola and I thought of. Please do add your own, suggest modification or removal of the ones you want. Once we have a good set of questions, we'll start with the answering! Enjoy the ride, the questions are here:




**Culture**

How does the average person dress where you live? (Reunion facebook photos with blurred out faces describe this better than a thousand words)

Is there a traditional way of dressing where you live, even if it's not used anymore? (pic would help here too)

What is the most culturally unique curse word you know? (as in, it is a product of your country's culture; bonus for explanation of what it means/how it came about/why is it offensive)

What do people of different ages and social backgrounds do for fun? (as in, go to the pub, disco, watch hockey games, engage in street fights, whatever)

At what times do people go to sleep in general, get up, have breakfast/lunch/tea/dinner?

What are the most celebrated holidays in your country? How do you celebrate them (Here's me expecting Mardi Gras/Carnaval like celebrations)

What common misconception about your country irritates you the most?

Name (and give pics) of 2 local celebrities (male and female) considered beautiful by your country.




**Politics**

Are people in your country happy with the current government? What things does it promote?

What things does the opposition promote? Is there a true leftist party, same for right wing? Is there any communist/socialist party?

What are the strongest and weakest points in your country? (Health Care, Education, Economic Stability, security, etc)

Age of consent? Age for drinking? Age for driving? Stance about drugs in general?




**Economy**

What's the minimum wage in dollars? How much does a managerial position pays? How about something in beetween like ""programmer"" or ""designer""?

How much (in dollars) does a Big Mac combo costs? How about a movie ticket? Square meter (or square foot) of real estate? pound/kilo of meat? Bottle of wine/beer? an iPhone?

Is there anything in your country that's remarkably cheaper/more expensive than in other places?


**Food &amp; Drinks**

What's the typical food like? (Link to recipes, pics would be yummy)

What are your options for beverages to go with the food?

What's your average breakfast like? Do you have tea?

Is there any local food that would look/sound/taste disgusting to foreigners?




**Landmarks &amp; Geography**

What are the top 3 landmarks? (pics/vids)

What is your country's best kept secret? That thing/place that tourists never do/see but is more important/beautiful than the national post card.

How's the weather in there?

Weirdest local animal? 




**Arts (Music/Films/Books/Painting/etc)**

What music is the most representative of your country? (link to youtube would be cool)

What author is the most representative of your country? (good to expand literary knowledge)

By decree of King Gustav Vasa of Sweden in 1550, the city was founded at the mouth of river Vantaa. From there, the city was moved further south to its present location in 1643. Helsinki has been the capital city since 1812, three years after Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire.

Helsinki continued as the capital after Finland gained its independence in 1917. Today, Helsinki is the centre of the Helsinki Region, a functional urban region of about 1.3 million inhabitants and 738,000 jobs.*

How's Helsinki for an English speaker (who would totally be trying to learn the language, not sitting on his high English horse)?

2) So Dublin and other cities saw massive growth in their digital commerce in the last 10 years. How's the web development/advertising industry? Yeah, specific, I know, but I like my profession.

My life is actually not a simple ""I live in the States, I'm French/Spanish.""
I am 19 years old, currently living in the state of Illinois, about two hours south from Chicago (which is my favorite American city!) where I study to become an international language teacher (I speak almost 4 languages). Turning 20 in December, I have visited 17 countries in the world, in which I have lived in 4: France, Japan, China, and the USA. I left France when I was 9 years old, and have yet to move back. 
From moving since such a young age, I am part of a minority called the Third Culture Kids (TCKs) that not many people know about.

This is why I'm mentioning it: I want people to see what it's like to live the life of a person who has not stayed in the same country for longer than 3.5 years.

[edit] Someone asked a question and deleted it. Here's my answer anyway:

Right now my bike is being repaired, so no biking for me. When I get my bike back, I won't be using it too often because I have a free public transport card for the entire country as a student. The weather's not too nice now, so I only bike when I have too, which could be anywhere from 200m to 5km.

What I enjoy most is the nonchalance of the people who live here. ""We've seen it all, don't panic, things could be way more extreme."" Something like that. I'm not sure if nonchalance is an English word though ;) Our canals are awesome as well. When it's sunny it's really common to be on the water with friends, enjoying a drink and food and a smoke.

I'm most proud of the way we treat visitors. Almost everybody speaks English pretty well, we're always willing to point you in the right direction when you're lost in the Red Light District and only the cab drivers will rip you off. And our waiters/waitresses are a pain in the ass, but they're like that to everybody, not just tourists."	t5_2r4v8	True

All you have to do is include your ""country code"" at the beginning of your post title (self-posts only).

There are some potential issues I can think of using the flags: 
 
* People might just not want to use them so it would be a waste of time to set up.  
* Since most users only make one post in /r/IliveIn they might not bother figuring out how to get the flag to show up.  
* The fact that you have to add your ""country code"" at the beginning of every post might clutter up how /r/ILiveIn looks.  
* Not every user has custom styles enabled.
